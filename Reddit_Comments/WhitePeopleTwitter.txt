yay i have not enjoyed the high number of truths showing up i hate seeing them inside a tweet but get doing that sometimes i appreciate the hard work y all are doing to keep this subreddit on topic and safe
has the site considered of using links to tweets instead of screen captures this would have several advantages it would be easy to identify real tweets it would be easy to detect i d a tweet is a duplicate is another the real tweet often has a video or embedded link
toots hasn t been the official term for months but i suppose it s clear what you mean this way they re just posts by default now
rats now i won t be able to make my standard joke about how apparently the sentence rule all posts must be a tweet is too difficult for qonservatives to understand in all those threads inevitably titled either yup or true anymore

should tweets be recent and not have the date cropped out
i wanted to post something very relevant to this subreddit but it was from linkedin yes or no
what s a toot
please make an announcement this reddit is becoming a breeding ground for answer violence with violence ideology just read some comments america is on the center of a massive cultural shift conservatives are on one side calling for violence against lgbtq more guns anti abortion agenda leftists are running out of a voice mostly due to how the hate speech by conservatives gets more reactions and therefore becomes louder and are starting to call on the same idea more violence in order to defend their rights i understand how bleak this seems but please act peacefully before considering violence america s culture is reflected worldwide and any massive movement even if it s pure violence will be echoed everywhere else please take the peaceful path first before resorting to violence take action stop working enact walkouts protests you have the power don t let the violent gop agenda consume you
trumps racism extends beyond twitter
removed
okay
removed
no post news or spoutable spouts or whatever they re called
you re correct about the advantages but it would also have disadvantages and the mod team has judged these to outweigh the benefits the main disadvantage it would make it a lot easier for people to go to the actual tweet itself and voice their discontent while we are aware that nothing is really stopping people from doing that now having to make the extra step to actually look for it makes it less convenient and many people don t bother removing even a small barrier mitigating harassment can be the difference between the subreddit thriving and it getting negative site admin attention a more minor disadvantage it would make the content less easy to read as only the thumbnail would show the tweet image and people would have to move offsite to read the subject of the post all in all we have decided that the format of screenshots of tweets and toots serves the subreddit and its community best
i don t like this idea because people who don t use twitter might not be able to see that plus that drives traffic to melons website and the less people who go there the quicker he will fail
technically correct but i m fairly active on mastodon and everyone on my instance and indeed the other instances where people i follow live we all call them toots it s funnier
no sorry unless you tweet it out make a screenshot of that and then post it here
it s a post on mastodon
calls for violence violate the sitewide terms of service and are explicitly against the rules people agreed to when they made an account
thank you for your thoughtful reply
funnier makes the platform seem like a joke and not something that can officially replace shitter
yeah what happened to that i thought this sub was supposed to abandon twitter and go there or something
i had such high hopes for that platform i got suspended for posting a link to the real covid transmission map from the cdc as opposed to the open hospital bed map in response to a covid denier replying to the people s cdc map that matched the real transmission map the denier accused the people s cdc of fake news because their map didn t match the cdc s map i explained why with links to the cdc source i got suspended i appealed it with cdc links and never heard back that site sucks
yup no different to twitter if the mods are not affected by public pressure or stock price effects they can do whatever they want
different tho since you can choose your mod and change to an instance with a different mod

remember in when the same republicans in tennessee refused to suspend a pedophile guess what party he was in no prize for guessing right he was a republican but you know fighting to save kids lives is expellable
the volunteer state y all such a beacon of freedom
let s call this what it is fascism the two parties are not the same edit let s now throw blantantly racist in there as well with the second vote
this is what fascism looks like fascism is not an abstract it is happening in red states all across the nation the question remains are you ok with losing all your rights and if not what are you going to do to fight for them
if conservatives become convinced that they cannot win democratically they will not abandon conservatism they will reject democracy david frum only half right as they ve abandoned conservatism too
what i ve noticed is that most republicans i know no longer can just accept disagreeing with the rest of us they are convinced they and only they are right in every regard and the rest of the country is misguided stupid criminal or all three again projection in so many forms but i ll be damned if some of the folks years i could have a conversation with now they are lost to that and they cannot abide keeping to themself or minding their own business you folks all know this it s only going to get uglier
i mean if they re removing dems from office for protesting that means we can get rid of mtg for going to new york and protesting or for helping with the whole insurrection thing we need to start using precedents these assholes set
what say the people of tennessee are they in support of this also is this even legal
my non american friend here doesn t understand surely they can t be kept out that s not how democracy works they have to be let back in right
time to break stuff
any state that commits acts like this should lose all immediate federal funding
lets not forget that they were expelled for protesting the fact children were murdered at school and nothing was being done about it fucking wild
can the republicans party be deemed a terrorist group already i mean they fit the definition
buh both sides are the same guys go fuck yourselves to anyone who claims such utter bullshit republicans are a literal cult of fascism
all they are doing is drawing more scrutiny on just how far they will push the boundaries they are shining a light on just how awful they are and they will be motivating more people who are on the sidelines and more people who disagree to get up and vote they are without a doubt fucking themselves whilst they fuck us
okay yes how many more times are we going to share hand wringing liberal commentators lamenting that republicans have abandoned democracy duh now fucking what how are you going to fight differently with the understanding that this isn t a sport but a struggle for the very survival of our imperfect vision of society we don t have to agree on utopian visions for the future we need only agree that fascism is bad and work together to absolutely destroy these fucking clowns
everyone likes to blame orange julius for the state of modern gop but it was the party that promoted and enabled the clown emperor not the other way around
they completely abandoned democracy a while ago they ve just figured out that there are no consequences to anything they ve done so they don t even bother pretending anymore
this is a great opportunity to reach out to volkswagen they are spending tons of money to manufacture cars in tennessee with the history of vw in ww2 etc it would be a great opportunity to get them to speak out against what is essentially fascism
a city crying out for answers after a massacre and this is how republicans choose to respond just wholly unacceptable
the gop in tennessee split up nashville into districts to try to gerrymander the heavily democratic voting area they aren t even trying to pretend like they re playing fair anymore
we need a general strike you want a peaceful revolution general strike no insurrection required we have all of the power we just have to organize
democrats need to respond this shit harshly no more hand wringing no more petty gotchas this is not acceptable
gif giphy 3o6zteouqlninbgsic downsized
democracy is truly dying
it s completely believable since the gop are a bunch of fascists they re a waste of air
some time soon the gop will just claim the government is theirs and dare us to take it back
three democrats were at the protest two black men and one white female the two black men were expelled from the house the white female was retained when asked what the difference was she replied it might have something to do with the color of our skin
republican s take more action against a gun protest than they do about kids being mowed down by guns
so we can definitely expel clarence thomas for accepting gifts right
so apparently you can just vote out the opposing faction whenever you want if you have a super majority news to me ridiculous function are all state legislators setup like this
but they used a bullhorn the decorum psssshh fuck off with that shit they had to use a bullhorn to even be heard children are being murdered and these people don t want to hear one damn word on gun reform break out all the bullhorns
what would happen if we had booted mtg and bobo for not displaying decorum
the optics on this are very bad especially that one representative who got up and yelled at pearson and accused him of having a tantrum and talked down to him the whole time there is no way to spin this that looks even remotely fair in years across all of america it has only happened a few times and only for cases involving criminal acts this was expulsion for breaking a silly rule in the wake of a violent bloody shooting and these ghouls on the gop side had the actual audacity to introduce evidence they didn t share accused them of unverifiable misconduct that occured privately supposedly ignored all the other rule violations that took place refused to let the one reps lawyers speak failed at every turn to even acknowledge gun violence this looks petty and racist and has absolutely raised the profiles of those two young black men to points that they are all but guaranteed to win special elections
hmmm nazis in the us perhaps gif giphy pvxqg4qy1ab9s
how long before they realize with such power they can expel them all then every red run state changes their rules to have the same power
so if a state in our union suddenly throws out the electoral process and goes full fascism the federal government does what
fascist gonna fascist
how do you just expel congress members and why haven t we done it to the insurrectionists
oh wow i thought my country was bad what the fuck happened to the supposed bastion of freedom in the western world seems like everyday the repugnant party tries its best to ruin the country for everyone else because the orange one lost the election
how is this legal though i m sure if someone dogs enough they can find far worse things from republicans they always get caught in huge hypocrisy
unbelievable really i get the title it s hard for me to process too but we need to come to understand the harsh reality that the republican party is the party of nazis fascists and authoritarians if they can simply vote to remove elected officials then the ballot box is no longer an option for change i think the future is going to be very dark we need to figure out what we re going to do
conservatives are fine with taxation without representation
how is that legal
i used to go to chattanooga as a weekend getaway fuck tennessee won t be getting a penny from me
they don t give a shit about votes or protests we need to speak with our dollars an immediate boycott of tennessee and anything coming out of nashville is what s called for put economic sanctions on the state
i am ashamed to be from tennessee
wait they just ripped a democrat from the seat they earned
they can run for office again holy shit i can t write the checks fast enough let s get these ballers reelected where do i send my fucking money ain t no time for no pity party nor is it time to lament how clever sketchy republicans are let s send these dudes right back in there reddit do what you do best
shrouding fascism in legalism cementing authoritarian control over a democratic system under the guise of following the rules sounds familiar i wonder why https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/14/hong-kong-pro-democracy-legislators-disqualified-parliament)
they ve been telling you this is their goal for years and people are surprised
how the fuck is it legal for them to kick democratically elected people out of the statehouse
we need to start calling them who we all know they are the nazi party
tennessee has completely fallen to fascism it is wholly owned and controlled by the fascists this isn t the only state with this problem wisconsin north carolina and florida are also completely controlled by fascists and several other states including kansas and montana are going to be there any day now we are losing our country to fascism we are not winning we are losing badly you cannot vote fascist out of power they will not respect your vote they must be removed from power so these states are wholly lost get ready because it only gets worse from here
less than of registered voters in tennessee turned out for the midterms https://www.wkrn.com/news/tennessee-politics/less-than-40-of-registered-voters-in-tennessee-turned-out-for-the-2022-midterms/) nashville tenn wkrn voter turnout in the midterm elections in tennessee was one of the lowest in nearly a decade fewer than half of the more than million registered voters in tennessee cast their ballots falling below for the first time since according to the secretary of state s office the unofficial turnout for the midterms was the secretary s office told news or of the registered voters the turnout is far below that of the election which saw of the registered voters of the electorate cast a ballot as well as where of voters cast their ballots the figure is the lowest turnout in a general election since the midterms which saw just of registered voters cast their ballots at that time there were only registered voters in tennessee and only of them made their voices heard in that election it is surprising with shit voter turnout like this that the trump cult in tennessee are acting like fascists what do they have to fear liberal progressive dem voters too lazy to get off their asses and vote in elections damn every single theocratic trump cult fascist gets their ass to the polls in every state local and federal election you can bet your life on that and until libs do the same we can count on more republican fascism and it will get worse and worse and worse people talkin revolution and civil war yet they can t even bother with voting shit we might as well surrender now and head off to the gop work camps in chains
https://www.youtube.com/live/ouj1bddtzdi if you can watch you should
not really they were never attached to democracy and are very adamant that we aren t a democracy i dare say the fascists are ramping up their fascism
if only they tried to overthrow the tn government then they would be considered heroes by the he dumbos
it s actually very believable republicans will stop at nothing to retain power
well the good thing sorta is they have to run special elections to elect someone to those seats and the current incumbents can run again so they need their constituents to turn out
does anyone know what biden has done about it i genuinely do not know if he s even made a statement yet
so much for constitutional republic
not to say i agree with it at all or that there is actually a reason for it but i think it is technically allowed there is some provision allowing for congresspeople to be removed though i m unsure if they met whatever language is outlined in this law again i believe this is wrong and fascist but american law also may have allowed it
question was there some legal technicality that enabled the gop to do this
have we entered stage of fascism because it feels like we ve entered stage stage four using power to dominate institutions the nazis on the other hand took total control over government and society hitler removed all non nazis from government shortly after becoming chancellor in he would go on to pass laws stripping jews of citizenship expelling anti nazi professors from universities banning rival political parties and enabling him to rule by decree meaning he could single handedly and without oversight create future laws germany became a one party country the nazis claimed to have won more than percent of the vote in subsequent unfree and unfair elections and after they ceased holding elections altogether via world
to those saying voting doesn t work you re right because people don t show up we know the stats if people showed up under the age of it would be a destructive sweep we are letting the ignorants and those willing to step up take over if we want it back we have to show up and play hardball
removed
i m starting to get nostalgic for when groups like the weather underground used to blow up things
forgive my moronitude but how is this not a blatant violation of first amendment protections they re being punished by the government for exercising their right to peaceful protest
full on fascists the gloves are off
but remember antifa are the real fascists things my ultra maga fathers side have actually said wish it was satire but they re not joking they believe that
oh hey it s fascism the gop should be renamed to the fascist fucks party
i m banned from the politics subreddit can the folks in tn sue due to their right of representation being violated
who s down for a general strike i can t afford it but i ll try to stop working for a while
this is going to piss the gen z ers straight to the polls
the republican party is dying and they know it republicans don t have any policies they don t know how to govern so they lie cheat steal and punish their enemies that s all they know how to do so they re getting more and more desperate because they know that their time is running out and i truly believe that they are so intent on winning that they will burn this country down
democrats should retaliate by voting to expel republicans in any state where dems have control
what s unbelievable is that it seems like nobody is doing anything about it and they will do it again and again and again look at the fascism in florida again nothing seems to be stopping it now is the time to stand up
the leader of the expulsion proceedings https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/legislatorinfo/member.aspx?district=h61
this is a shameless power grab i hope a team of lawyers show up for them
they don t need democracy fascists don t believe in it
cool now remove all republicans from us government and cut off tennessee from all government funding
what is unbelievable about this it s tennessee
i really hope you guys can resolve this without war
so now they will have a special run off correct if that s the case is there anything stopping them from running in that and if they do run and win can they be expelled again
can someone legitimately explain to me how this is actually like possible how is one party allowed to just expel members of another
i m old enough to fear becoming aunt lydia
the repuglikkklan party abandoned democracy when they elected reagan
they know they ve survived their last election cycle their desperation will only make them more savage
the fuck was it even for like obviously they just didn t want democrats in office but what did they use as justification
it s great to be an ex tennessean
extremely believable actually
republicans want fascism not democracy they want a mussolini not lincoln
they are shooting themselves in the foot and when their panic sets in is when those of us who oppose fascism will really have to be concerned enough to actively fight it them they truly want a civil war so they can actively use their amassed weapons against the others those who oppose them or don t look think act like them i don t think they realize that rational people can become rabid when push comes to shove the center and left aren t as stupid or as ignorant as trumpians or de satanists or mc abbots or the evilgelicals nor are we incapable of doing what needs to be done when necessary i m from wisco and we have just begun to reclaim democracy
republicans are just racist xenophobic fascist assholes and the whole party needs to be thrown away
isn t there a violation of the u s constitution here
this next potus election is going to be a shitshow from hell even when we overwhelmingly out vote them the battle will rage on this is the dog that s killed one to many chickens
why do you keep calling republicans fascist look at their fucking actions
the fact that they re comparing this to j6 is wild to me the protesters never made it to the house floor or even tried as far as i can tell and they weren t trying to overthrow the government unlike the j6 losers
how can they even expel an elected representative people voted him into his position can someone eli5 edit explain like i m a 5yo non american
he will be back they just made his platform more powerful and notable these dicks don t even know what they are doing
really makes you realize just how disgusting the republican party is instead of listening to and trying to actually do something about the insane number of shooting deaths of children in this country they re removing rightfully elected members of their state to make them stop calling for action the entire party is so bought and sold by the gun lobby that they re willing to remove elected officials to silence them the entire party is despicable
wi shows hope the gop pissed the youth off enough to vote and they just gave the edge to turn it blue the youths voted democrat gop can keep their shit up but they are distancing themselves quickly from the younger voters and their voters are dying off daily not a formula for long term success
so a bunch of white people voted the black representative out in tennessee you can t make this shit up
fascist republicans made this young man a star cnn msnbc are showing this shitshow live too republicans won t be able to lie their way out of this although they ll definitely try
the reaction to stuff like this gives me hope the gop pretty much wants to ban democracy i just dont think they are gonna be able to do fast enough vote for us or its the end of democracy is not how the democrats should be winning votes but that is how it will be in it may also be why some previously gop states see a major change in the voting demograpihcs
more years and he can go for governor or us senate
better believe it if i was him i would run again for the same seat and i would probably win because young people are fed up of rich old white guys telling everyone what they should want
the youth are truly the only hope for tn and other southern republican strongholds of hell we need you you young adults show up
did mtg ask to be recognized as she interrupted the president no so expel her too
nazi control in tennessee shame on you tennessee banana republic party
the fascists begin their purges
so how does this work going forward do they have to have new elections or do the people of their districts just get no representation for the next years wtf kind of unconstitutional shit is this
gop at its finest they hate abortion but don t care to protect kids and in ks they want to make sure kids are the gender they claim to be christofascism is real and very much alive
meanwhile in nc a democrat representative has literally changed her party to republican months into her term to give the gop a supermajority betraying our representative democracy and every democrat who voted for her yet she can t get expelled because republicans have the majority and this suits their corrupt rhetoric our founding fathers would be ashamed of what we ve become
the injustice of it all is overwhelming
it s literally ignoring those people s will and voice lol how much more unconstitutional do you need to get gerrymandering wasn t enough obviously
those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable john f kennedy
tn faces boycotts fed funds withheld and lots of economic stations from the private sector they screwed the wrong pooch
the youth is watching and is moving aggressively left it s a question of whether the younger gens millennial and below will take control of the major vote before democracy is completely subverted this move cements these three as left wing martyrs that s a hell of a strong platform to give them not to mention it s to fight for students safety you don t forget the helpers while children are gunned down every week it was the left that fought to protect them it was the right who silenced them
civil right movement this time it s monetizable
ok now both men expelled and the white woman holds on by one vote democrats have been expelled for exercising their first amendment rights this is only the beginning our democracy is going down and i do believe there are racial undertones overtones at play here the people are rightfully angry
day of shame for tn i begin to see how north korea happens
the only good i can think of is that this situation shows just how scared republicans are they re scared that the public will pay attention to issues and demand to have their voices heard they expelled jones as a warning not to break the status quo but it s actually a signal that breaking the status quo works and conservatives are terrified that they ll lose their power if people demand justice
now i wonder what would happen if a special election in his district re elected him as their representative
the tn gop has literally nothing to gain from this they already have a super majority they are literally shooting from the hip and making decisions based on rage my toddler does the same thing proof they have no concept of a long game or even how politics work in general this will surely hurt them in the long run maybe not in tn but the ripple effect will hurt them elsewhere
all those kids about will be able to vote in the next election and the rest of them in the next election every day approximately americans turn these people have been hunted in their schools since kindergarten who do you think the majority of them will vote for these old white guys are scared shitless and trying their damndest to get everything they can before it is over for them
the tennessee three have just been elevated to a national stage they re all smart as whips these republicans will be exposed for the frauds they are
educated articulate black man the gop will not have that
he just became a martyr without even dying
both black representatives voted out single white woman remains way to think outside the box my white christian nationalist fellas jesus it s the 1880s all over again
just stopping in to say i had an unexpected layover in nashville and everyone was miserable they need more drag queens imo
i feel for all democrats in the south and places like idaho right now seattle isn t perfect but it feels like a bubble of sanity comparatively
there were protesters they only kicked out the two black justin s jones speech on this vote was very impassionate and intelligent the tennessee democratic party chair hendrell remus said there have been republicans who ve been arrested for bribery who have committed crimes that stemmed from inside of the house we didn t see this type of posturing towards them
i swear to god reddit if i look this guy up and find out the expulsion was justified i will never trust you again edit nah y all are right even fox thinks it s absurd https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tennessees-gop-led-house-votes-expel-democrat-justin-jones-legislature-his-role-gun-protest.amp
i said years ago when trump was elected it was coming i said it when they tried to delegitimize the presidency of barrack obama it was coming i said when they were coming for woman s rights to be aware and now that they have thrown out duly elected black men for defending kids and demanding gun control it is time the line in the sand was just drawn they will take everything away from you if they want stop being mad stop being pissed fix it stop being complacent stop making excuses vote them out
state rep justin jones is the new rockstar of the democratic party brilliant guy smart articulate brilliant speaker now the entire country knows who he is kinda reminds me of someone else a few years ago bo
hello fascism sure didn t ever expect to see you in the usa but alas here we are kidnapping children making kids expose their genitalia discrediting and firing truth speakers during a pandemic absolutely shameful interesting how this is gaining momentum after wwii vets have pretty much all passed no one left with first person accounts of evil
so democrats can be expelled but nothing can be done when elected officials switch parties mid term what
the gop don t really even seem to understand what they re doing the young folks are watching tennessee is so incredibly red that it won t affect them like it will like some other areas the days of red are done the young are watching and they re definitely going to associate this with fascism racism all the isms the gop are setting themselves up for future failure
i stand with both pearson and jones i may not be a direct constituent but i do live in the state whatever they may need i ll be there it is a mockery of democracy what is being done to them they had the forthrightness to stand up for what they saw as an injustice and are being punished for it their voices and the voices of the young people will not be silenced
republicans are counting on young people to be too stupid deluded and distracted to ever mobilize against them they are going to make sure you are uneducated hustling five jobs just to survive and the only joy you get is from posting silly posts for likes it s the owning class v everyone else and the soon the public wakes up to that the better
fuck the gop i hope gen z burns that piece of shit party to the ground
i for one am getting really tired of minority rule the extremely wealthy the theocratic and the ignorant but confident have way too much control in this country we need ranked choice voting more and more lobbying needs to be voluntary and term limits should apply to every public office especially the judiciary
one possibly good thing is i m planning to run in tn or die trying to put a progressive into a formerly red district tennessee has problems but there are people here willing to fight for her if you live in tn and are old enough to vote make sure you re registered and the biggest gains to be made anywhere in the country are from convincing the apathetic non voters to engage in politics the coalition that needs to be built for human freedom and democracy doesn t need to include the hyper voting fox news watchers we ll just have to bring them along for the ride towards a better future i pray that tn will soon have its own georgia or michigan moment keep the fight up y all
mind blowing that of the three they put up for expulsion the two black men got kicked out but they don t vote to kick the white woman out like jesus christ do you hillbillies realize this is all on tv and at least one of them had to put up with getting the most condescending lecture from the twat who sponsored the expulsion legislation did everything short of calling him boy in the like three minutes i watched of this train wreck
tennessean checking in jones and pearson can be appointed right back to their positions almost immediately and from what it sounds like from their county commissioners that s exactly what is going to happen
am i reading everything right they only expelled the black men
email everyone who voted to remove him make your voice heard https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/legislatorinfo/directory.aspx?chamber=h you can just do something like this for years one of your colleagues an admitted child molester sat in this chamber no expulsion rep justin jones
the silver lining he went from a no name state rep that few people outside tn had probably heard of to a household name over night
i hope so but i doubt it more and more
why do republican s hate democracy should be the first question on any debate stage or interview come election time
he called all those old white kkk members out
does this mean he has been expelled for this legislative session or has he been effectively removed from office entirely and now a new special election needs to take place to fill his seat people need to rise up against this protest call the offices of the assholes who did this contact anyone and everyone do what you can to support their opposition so they lose future elections demand their removal through recalls this is unacceptable
they can and will run again in the special election and go right back in republicans are idiots because they just poured gasoline on a huge fire and brought way more attention to this than would have happened normally
the gop just activated every single young voter in the state the demographic they fear the most
i can tell you exactly where of my tourism money will be going
jokes on them his district is just going to send him back as a special representative and then elect him at the special election
yes the gop really messed up here they turned them into heroes
i truly belive all of these power grabs and restrictive laws are going to end up hurting the gop in a major way they are riling up their opposition and many people who didn t vote before will be now
i hope all the republicans who are involved in this mess will get voted out in the next election
republicans are uniformly awful
the have either no clue or no care how dangerous it can be to play with this fire
yeah maybe germany will join england and france to defeat nazi america
what a shock republicans expelled the black folks and let the white lady stay they don t even try to hide their evil anymore
oh look they re taking control of legislative bodies by illegal means now saw that one coming
just like with trump republicans want to take the short term win and the long term loss in gen z came out and destroyed the republican s hopes and dreams for a red tsunami and just recently wisconsin flipped a pro trump supreme court seat it s only going to get worse for republicans because nobody with a sane mind is going to support this especially new voters republicans are fascists and their voters will still keep voting for it because winning is more important
i better wake up to stories of nashville being sacked by its residents riot tennessee if you actually care about democracy and people doing the work for you
not just some thoughts and prayers how can i help support in any way this is deplorable bullshit
i hope he runs again for his seat and wins by a landslide
how s this not an obvious violation of right to assembly
is there a minimum quorum if all democrats would be expelled or voluntarily leave their position would that trigger new elections or an intervention from the governor or even federal action
donate money to his campaign
fuck the gop
the county commissioners can appoint a replacement the replacement can be the person who was expelled i really hope they do this you can t be expelled twice for the same thing i really hope it comes back to crush them honestly we won t have fair elections until gerrymandering is abolished it s the only hope of election republicans have that s why instead of trying to get people to vote for them with promises of better days to come they actively try to prevent people from voting for anyone else
too many americans are sitting back watching all this happen across multiple states if they re not angry by now i m not sure what will motivate them
these two who were expelled should run again in the election to fill the spots
we need to get him out on every campaign trail on tv on radio they made a mistake we have a martyer now
as much as i would love to think so i doubt it will for a long time the gop have gerrymandered states so much that huge majorities of people are being governed by the extreme minority wi just made huge stride with a judge but the gop have that state in death grip right now it will take a long time to fix what they ve done to that state i imagine this state is the same gop have given up on democracy and abide by laws only apply to their voters and those who oppose them are criminals
yes the local governments that these represent have the legal authority to reinstate them this was an attempt by the gop to distract from the larger issue at hand and it appears to have galvanized residents
i can t stand the stupidity and cruelty i m seeing in the u s lately every day something worse happens the country is going to implode one day
i ll contribute to his senate campaign today
i donated to the tn democratic party just now
republicans trying real hard for a sumner moment
if people don t wake up and start naming and shaming this kind of stuff as fascism it s going to be too late pretty soon
tennessee i thought you were marginally better than alabama cuba or turkmenistan i stand corrected
the old white guys don t seem to realize they need the votes of the we the young people seeing as their base is dying off and we will never vote for them though so they need to go down
republicans had been digging a hole for years on election night they hit a big metal pipe they have been hitting this pipe with their shovels ever since then because they want to dig their hole deeper little do they know that pipe is really full of pressure and lava when it bursts they are not gonna have a ladder to climb out i can t wait for the pipe to burst
they can pretend it was about this or about that but in my gut i kind of feel this is retaliation for t p getting held accountable and indicted by a black da alvin bragg and about to be indicted by a black da fani willis also ag letitia james a phenomenal litigator against t p he s called all of them racists very red t p won by their excuse is bullshit
young people all over the country are watching while the gop is trying everything they can to take what they can get away with from those same citizens in case they are not paying attention this country is soon to belong to the young and they don t like your fucking red asses jmo
why is our country so disgusting
today the world got to see hate on full display in tn racism is alive and well and when republicans have complete power they stomp on democracy
republicans are fascists
conservatives have to stop imitating their idol putin someone needs to educate the conservatives this is america maybe they need to move to russia and thake their traitor trumpf with them
the whole world watched the holocaust and didn t do shit for a long time too the whole world watching isn t much comfort
do they really think a one party state is the answer one party one mind one opinion never thought i would see that in the us but then again the last years i ve seen a lot of things i never thought i would see in the us
especially the young people of tennessee the republicans are in fact doomed just a matter of how longer they are in power
sooooo they expel the african americans but keep the white rep mmmmkay
you see my colleague went on one doesn t see exactly where or how to move believe me this is true each act each occasion is worse than the last but only a little worse you wait for the next and the next you wait for one great shocking occasion thinking that others when such a shock comes will join with you in resisting somehow you don t want to act or even talk alone you don t want to go out of your way to make trouble why not well you are not in the habit of doing it and it is not just fear fear of standing alone that restrains you it is also genuine uncertainty uncertainty is a very important factor and instead of decreasing as time goes on it grows outside in the streets in the general community everyone is happy one hears no protest and certainly sees none you know in france or italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences in germany outside the great cities perhaps there is not even this in the university community in your own community you speak privately to your colleagues some of whom certainly feel as you do but what do they say they say it s not so bad or you re seeing things or you re an alarmist and you are an alarmist you are saying that this must lead to this and you can t prove it these are the beginnings yes but how do you know for sure when you don t know the end and how do you know or even surmise the end on the one hand your enemies the law the regime the party intimidate you on the other your colleagues pooh pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic you are left with your close friends who are naturally people who have always thought as you have but your friends are fewer now some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work you no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings informal groups become smaller attendance drops off in little organizations and the organizations themselves wither now in small gatherings of your oldest friends you feel that you are talking to yourselves that you are isolated from the reality of things this weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to to what it is clearer all the time that if you are going to do anything you must make an occasion to do it and then you are obviously a troublemaker so you wait and you wait but the one great shocking occasion when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you never comes that s the difficulty if the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest thousands yes millions would have been sufficiently shocked if let us say the gassing of the jews in had come immediately after the german firm stickers on the windows of non jewish shops in but of course this isn t the way it happens in between come all the hundreds of little steps some of them imperceptible each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next step c is not so much worse than step b and if you did not make a stand at step b why should you at step c and so on to step d and one day too late your principles if you were ever sensible of them all rush in upon you the burden of self deception has grown too heavy and some minor incident in my case my little boy hardly more than a baby saying jewish swine collapses it all at once and you see that everything everything has changed and changed completely under your nose the world you live in your nation your people is not the world you were born in at all the forms are all there all untouched all reassuring the houses the shops the jobs the mealtimes the visits the concerts the cinema the holidays but the spirit which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms is changed now you live in a world of hate and fear and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves when everyone is transformed no one is transformed now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to god the system itself could not have intended this in the beginning but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way copyright notice excerpt from pages of they thought they were free the germans by milton mayer
so all republicans voted to expell two people of color but aquit gloria johnson damn they aren t even trying hard to hide their racism any longer
looks like the vacation in tenn is canceled
they are digging themselves into a whole lot of trouble keep up the shit gqp you re going to regret it
i d be real curious to hear how the folks who voted to expel these three feel about the jan 6th cowards i m real sure that bunch of scum bags is viewed as patriots and fine people
super fuck every one of these fascist assholes
shocker the racist republicans eject the two african american members but not the white woman fuck tennessee fuck the south
it s gonna come back to bite them and they ll just throw their hands up and cry lib conspiracy over and over again it s gonna be the conservative strategy from now on
these kids that were protesting will be voting
i am of the belief in years the republican party will be of our population and never hold a majority anywhere again and it s going to be glorious
punch a nazi start in tennessee texas and florida
they get all up their own asses about the constitution and can t even uphold the first amendment
fascistgop should trend all day every day
what consequences seriously what consequences
can he just run again in the special election
get out and vote people
will there be legal pushback this is beyond fucked up
republicans are assaulting democracy by also hollowing it out from the inside this kind of unnecessary revenge tactics will turn off most educated people with common sense from politics so anyone remotely competent won t even think of politics as a profession they can keep holding on to power using the bottom of the barrel scum politicians
the republican party is so doomed and it knows it they ll relish what they consider a victory but soon never to be heard from again
where do i send my campaign contribution for his reelection
yeah but you don t actually do anything to stop them the right in the us is getting more and more extreme because they tested the waters and saw that the left will look at outdated rules and say well i guess we re powerless no matter what they do no matter how extreme grow a fucking backbone the nazis weren t this brazen with this level of control i ve never seen a more complacent people
need a federal takeover of tennessee they are in open rebellion against democracy
they never wanted him among their ranks in the first place they don t respect him or the people who elected him they never believed he deserved to be there
new york state should do the same thing this time with george santos
this has me worried being a veteran it s disgusting and authoritarian which leads to fascism
one of these members are not like the other i m not saying it was overt racism i m just saying it was overt racism
bro they ve gerrymandered a large portion of these southern states what could ve helped actual democracy was that voters right act the john lewis one but as usual when in power the democrats can pass shit that would actually help them help people in general and not just biden obama could ve done something for all the dick riding these neo liberals do for his mediocre run
if you fire shots expect to receive them back republicans are a minority in all but power in our social system they should be worried
apparently the county commissions for nashville davidson county and memphis shelby county can just re appoint both of them and they can just run again in the special election in months
as pointed out people were voted on and were expelled guess which one was the white woman no hate to gloria johnson who as far as i can tell is good people
republicans are making it so so easy for people to be radicalized to hate them i try not to generalize but its fair to say they re all shit
count me in when your raising cash for lawyers dude
shhhh hes blaaaaaack jus sayin
just don the friggin white hoods already tn in the toilet
it s scary that they can just invalidate an election like that democrats may remove republican members from committees but they don t outright expel them now we know where they stand though they don t give a shit if a million kids die in school shootings
absolutely horrendous the blatant racism that happened here i hate how much power racist republicans have and how rarely white liberal politicians call out their behavior
so they just up and decided to kick out voted in officials fuck these fucking guys
old racists hate education please remember that when you vote
and they re using the bullshit excuse that they were leading an insurrection like are you fucking kidding me do they think we don t have fucking eyes bold face gaslighting everyone should be insulted by how stupid these dipshits think we are
you see if they imprison and disenfranchise the opposition there can t be consequences that s where we re going with this
for the people who need a refresher on what fascism is cough cough gop which honestly at this point should just be updated to kkk fascism is an ultranationalist authoritarian political philosophy it combines elements of nationalism militarism economic self sufficiency and totalitarianism it opposes communism socialism pluralism individual rights and equality and democratic government fascism places the importance of the nation above all else the unity of the national community is prioritized above the rights of individuals this leads to an intense interest in defining which groups belong or do not belong to the national body fascism is characterized by strident often exclusionary nationalism fixation with national decline real or perceived and threats to the existence of the national community embrace of paramilitarism in fascist states violence is accepted even celebrated if it serves or advances the national community for fascists violence often has a redemptive or purifying quality fascism rejects the practices of representative or liberal democratic government it holds that these practices interfere with the expression of the national will instead fascist governments are one party states led by an authoritarian leader who claims to embody the national will fascists define the national will as advancing the interests of the national community this usually means protecting or elevating the rights of the national community above the rights of those seen as alien removing obstacles to national unity and suppressing those seen as challenging it expanding the size and influence of the national state often also seeking to expand territory through armed conflict
somebody call stacy abrams she s needed in tennessee immediately
fuck yeah and fuck them i m a gun enthusiast and this shit is beyond reasonable time to vote mother fuckers also i m drunk whatever
wow tennessee are you and florida competing for worst state
i thought the gop was all about the first amendment only if they re in control of the megaphone and beating us over that head with the latest drivel i mindless drivel i guess
did they even bother to say he committed a crime
it s just the beginning
how much of this is too much for conservatives
dolly parton should take over
nashville just plans to send him back
watched every minute today wish we had politicians like this in illinois
yes we do justin jones hopefully will be on every channel
republicans so afraid of free speech
i saw his pic before i read the article and knew he was being pushed out shit is shameless
probably because his hair didn t meet dress code standards getting to the point where i can t wait for that generation to die off
could they just run in the special election and win again
this was just an excuse to get rid of the person of color call a spade a spade

what happened is wrong but this constant moral high ground the democrats are taking in the face of fascism is the absolute worst yeah young people are paying attention and may do some good in the future but that does nothing for what s happening right now young progressives may one day be pushed into joining the the political system but by then the system will haven been so corrupted and destroyed the odds of fixing it will be little to none our governing political and societal system is literally a sisyphusian situation but hey at least we have the moral high ground and can virtue signal in the face of literal fascism
protest
deleted
you all do realize that the state dem committee can just name the expelled back as the replacements right in the end this is all political theater
unfortunately young people don t vote in numbers comparable to boomers i hope things change but it s not likely
why do people on twitter think young people care about politics or are watching they re not they re on tiktok and ig doom scrolling through the night this isnt europe no action will come
expelled someone trying to subvert the us constitution good
the worlds watching but nobody in our government gonna stand with you
i think people in tn support this kind of shit or they wouldn t have elected the trash that did it
will they suffer any consequences tennessee seems pretty comfortable with what s it s doing fascism isn t at the door it s in the house
but they couldn t get rid of the white woman odd
the voters should just vote in another democrat
heisenberg you re god damn right
hate to say this but nothing will be done
in the best case scenario he will be appointed the interim representative until they can have a special election to replace his vacant seat he will win that election and be returned to his rightful place representing the people who elected him i disagree with this man on gun control but i absolutely stand behind him in upholding representative democracy
as a millennial i love gen z you guys are the first generation in a long time to understand that there is a moral imperative to disobey the rules when following does not lead to a just outcome and follow through with actually breaking the rules jones and pearson broke the rules because they knew that following was not justice hear me now anyone who thinks democracy is impartial is going to get played the system is not morality itself the rules will not protect us from bad ideas like fascism the only thing that can protect us from a bad idea is a better idea and the spine to implement it regardless of what the rules say
regret and pay the consequences i don t see that happening
don t we have a tried and true method of dealing with fascists i could have sworn we did guess it s back to polite dialogue and easily ignored peaceful protesting while they start rounding up undesirables
eventually hopefully sooner than later this will come back to bite them in the ass this is unreal what s happening
this just in
we stand with you okay when are we going to actually do something about it
so funny how wpt cares more about this fake mlk jr than even bpt does white guilt twitter
ironically they tried to cancel him the hypocrisy in politics in america is at an all time high
lol no they won t who cares if young people are watching young people aren t wise they are idiots older people know history we need to up the voting age to
i m happy that pathetic january 6th impersonator lost his job i hope the world is watching so we can show the world how we haven t completely lost our minds if we can throw the jan 6th insurrectionists in jail then we should be able to throw these march 30th insurrectionists that they belong in jail as well
she knows it too and is not being quiet about it she was interviewed and said it s almost as if race has something to do with it
it s gopheadhuntseason boys
love that someone has already called this out because i came here just to say it and even better that she is calling it out
when have they ever hidden it
straight out of the 50s and they don t give a shit about the optics either apparently fuck democracy too while we re at it
good please don t give these states any tourist money it s bad enough my taxes go to them currently can t move anytime soon sadly my family didn t understand why i didn t want to vacation in florida this year
as a nashville native we may miss your money but please stay away fight with your wallet it s going to take a world of hurt for us to turn the votes and make a change
this is the way besides actual voting i vote with my dollar floriduh is definitely off my list texas was never on nashville seemed cool not anymore i think that other than actual violence the dollar is where the gqp can be hurt
deleted
they won t they ll become more violent they might win don t lose sight of that
of voters including a majority of republiqans want stricter gun laws
lets not kid ourselves into thinking whatever perception might be held at the moment couldnt be undone by a weeks worth of directed messaging from the idiot box in a year from now
except they ve fucked the voting maps so hard in some places that they ll hold onto their districts for another years
in what way it s not like anything will come of it the american people would need to go outside or be motivated to do something and if you can find me a lazier people who are more ready to give up and die i ll eat my socks
trouble with who there are no consequences for anyone anymore
from what i saw they were trying to draw a comparison between them and the insurrectionist that stormed the capital on january 6th
in the words of their lord and savior we love you you re all very special
i said this on another post and i ll say it again these two young men who got expelled were elected in their areas by and almost jones and pearson respectively sources at bottom for the non believers republicans don t care about democracy they don t care about their constituents they don t care about anything but the lobbyists who line their pockets and they ll do anything they can to keep it that way it s fucking bullshit https://ballotpedia.org/justin_jones_(tennessee_state_representative) https://ballotpedia.org/justin_pearson_(tennessee)
how many tennessee legislators were in d c on january 6th
hell ya we won t forget this republicans want to destroy democracy they are afraid of the youth vote and they should be here is the link to the tennessee democratic party where you can find resources volunteer opportunities and register to vote https://www.tndp.org/
we must vote
this is literally going to go down in the history books well the american ones at least not the un american domestic enemy conservative ones literally blows my mind that domestic enemy republicans like this still exist today
i m eagerly waiting for the super cut of pearson s responses in the debate they were glorious takedowns of everything wrong with the gop house
oh yeah i m certain ejecting a black state representative who dared to act uppity and stand up to the fascist gop white majority s bullshit had nothing to do with racism in the tennessee legislature none whatsoever in fact nothing to see here
wheres mtg s expulsion for protesting trumps indictment everyday i lose more and more faith in this world
i know nothing about tn state politics but i can t imagine this is polling or being received well anywhere but the super red areas and even then i m from the rural south but the expelling of members and the way they spoke to these men it seems very likely to backfire the kids the protests would have lessened in a week or two at least the frequency would have but now they ve brought more attention added more support and gone way too far between the racism the free speech democracy the school shootings etc this seems like such a bad idea
the major miscalculation here is that this move will not ignite their base it will however ignite and unite everyone else against them these people are as dumb as they are hateful a walkout from schools is not enough shut the entire state down with protests and strikes
their actions are only helping speed up their downfall
out of the three people that were subject to a vote to expel the tennessee gop only voted to expel the two black men this was racially motivated retaliation and a betrayal of our democracy
what manner of rule or law allows one elected official or group to simply kick out another elected official in this way should we expect more of this should we be surprised this is the first we are seeing of it
just a warning the confederate state do not care how bad and ridiculous they look
ummm just as a reminder he was legitimately and democratically elected by the people in his district
this guy is one of the most talented orators i think i ve ever seen i hope it his is just the beginning for him
the gop are desperate look at desantis having of his biggest rivals in fl arrested in the same week this isn t surprising in a state that celebrates its klan heritage so much they were founded there in tn and lo and behold the white woman was the only one who wasn t expelled i don t think its a coincidence
bro i watched an hour of this meeting or whatever it s called how can anyone make a justification for this guy being expelled absolutely ridiculous
how does that work who fills those spots now please tell me it s not legal for the republicans to just fill them with more republicans
dope afro
southern republicans are vile scum the scum that rests on the bottom of a dumpster that hasn t been emptied in months
can they run again
the time is always right to do what is right
mannnn you re right they re on fiyahhhhh now
how dare they protest the murdering of defenseless children so impolitely
the house voted along party lines to expel jones pearson was removed in a vote seems to me like democracy worked exactly like it s supposed to maybe people should vote in more democrats or vote to remove the ability to expel state legislators in the first place
young people won t even remember this in months more likely than not by the time election season rolls around the people who did this will be up in the polls
yeah i ll believe it when i see it tennessee will continue to be overwhelmingly gop the rest of my life and all the talk about young people voting d will come to oh maybe a increase because talk is so much easier than actually taking the trouble to register and keep track of when election day is and then you need to complain about how the dems are just as bad if i were a gop strategist or politician i d go to bed tonight pretty secure in my future prove me wrong
white lady democrat stayed she could have walked out in solidarity but seems like she didn t interesting
gun violence in the us specifically is not something that can ever be stopped unfortunately protesting it is a fool s errand there are way too many guns to get rid of even if the dems managed to get them banned gun owners would just bury guns in their backyard or stash them in other secret locations
why did this post get so many downvotes
add it to the list it seems like republicans are only doing things that young voters won t forgive strange strategy lol
dudes gonna be president
every one of these tweets talks about young people was there something special done by young voters or is this just the slogan they all agreed on
i hope justice pearson finds his way back into politics preferably in a higher office and keeps rocking that fresh af afro the whole time he s doing it i love this guy s whole deal from what i ve seen so far tbh his image and his substance
goop just keeps digging their grave next election
this looks like a memorial photo i hope that isn t a bad omen
time for him to run for congress
republikkklans are making the usa a laughing stock in the rest of the world not that they re capable of understanding that when they can t get past their own racist mysoginistic homophobic fascist bullshit trying to pathetically hold onto power fortunately young people are waking up and the gop is going to be relegated to the sickening minority they actually are signed year old boomer
or this in florida rep mark foley was forced to resign after it was revealed that he d sent sexually explicit messages and propositioned teenage congressional pages via email and text in former rep dennis hastert the longest ever serving republican speaker of the house pleaded guilty to making illegal hush money payments in order to cover up his history of sexually abusing high school wrestlers he had coached decades before nothing is more stunning than having serial child molester and speaker of the house in the same sentence the judge said at his sentencing during and after the presidential race among the dozens of women who accused former president donald trump of being a sexual predator were several contestants in the miss teen usa pageant who reported that he barged into their dressing room while girls as young as were changing trump allegedly told them don t worry ladies i ve seen it all before his campaign denied the accusation but cnn unearthed a howard stern interview where trump bragged about walking into backstage dressing rooms at the pageants he ran during the midterms alabama senate candidate roy moore was accused of preying on girls as young as and the new yorker reported that his habit of trying to pick up high schoolers was so notorious that it actually got him banned from a local mall also in rep jim jordan one of trump s fiercest allies and a co founder of the hardline conservative freedom caucus became embroiled in a scandal over his time as a wrestling coach at ohio state university where a team doctor named richard strauss who committed suicide in was found to have sexually abused more than male student athletes an investigation commissioned by the university found that strauss regularly used examinations as an excuse to grope and fondle the students sometimes to the point of ejaculation often ordered them to strip nude unnecessarily and in two cases attempted to perform oral sex numerous former wrestlers told reporters that jordan was personally aware of the abuse during the early 1990s but chose to turn a blind eye the congressman simply denied having any knowledge of it and suggested at least one of the accusers claiming otherwise was acting on a personal vendetta against him and finally rep matt gaetz of florida is currently the subject of a literal sex trafficking investigation which is looking into whether he had sex with an underage year old girl among other issues greene is close with gaetz who denies the allegations and has defended him
these guys are for sure going national now
what that they ll treat everyone fair and equally under the law isn t that what this racist as shit community wants s
it s not bullshit i mean it is but it s more than that it s the endgame it s the hail mary republicans are accepting now that they are totally and irretrievably fucked electorally this is all they ve got left and they will try it as many times as they can
could they run for the seat again
so will there now be new elections to replace the expelled
that doesn t matter they will not be held responsible and if an attempt is made they will not cooperate us citizens are being reminded again where conservatives stand i don t think there s any way back out now the christofascist minority have manoeuvred themselves into positions of power and they won t go quietly
they re going for broke they read the room and decided yup our party is fucked forever if we stick with this democracy thing
they are afraid of the youth vote and they should be yeah they re not going to let a little thing like democracy take away their power though
either that or we arm the homeless
i think he will be seated til the special election and then if he is smart he will run again and win at the end of the day it s a waste of time for the republicans at the voters get the final say
for who on the federal level obviously dems are better but joe ain t doing shit bro seems like he s green lighting the restrict act as well we re getting fucked regardless democrats outside of bernie are just enablers who simply will run on these issues for political clout and then do absolutely nothing
that domestic enemy has a name it s fascists don t let them run and hide from the appropriate language that defines them and their actions bury them with it just like they re burying innocent trans people and women s bodily autonomy right now
desantis is probably demanding that this news isn t even making headlines in fl
amazing speaker his final remarks are going to be in my memory for a while
it will backfire both of these gentleman will be back in office relatively quickly and once they are they have a much larger and brighter platform
i m sure the ruling party has the state thoroughly gerrymandered to the point that all their districts are perfectly safe and i m sure that it s polling wonderfully among the bozos who are going to vote in the only elections that do matter the primaries
they were literally chanting fuck you fascists clap clap clapclapclap in the capitol today the young kids are not okay and they re pissed
the gop are grasping at straws to retaliate for their golden boy trump getting arrested just a salty old gop as usual only now fully and openly fascist to the delight of their cult following
which rivals did he have arrested
i think this will backfire on the r s the international spotlight was and will be placed on this situation for weeks it s obvious the r s just wanted to distract from the real issue of gun violence by removing these two lawmakers and we are all noting that they did not remove the third lawmaker who happens to be white she thinks racism factored into that vote i think that the two men will eventually be reelected or reinstated but what a waste of time and money all while doing nothing to help resolve the ongoing gun violence problem the two lawmakers are very articulate and smart and i look forward to seeing them return to their jobs
local government selects replacements they re already saying they ll put them back in place
they probably remain empty the loss of two people won t bring them below quorum threshold
yep
get on the old google box and type in gerrymandering
the youth turnout recently has been pretty good comparatively the last several decades especially in swing states they prefer dems by an almost point margin gen x and millennials aren t the youth anymore while the former completely squashed their opportunity and the latter only just realized they did the next gens are not doing the same
must be why the republicans are wanting to raise the voting age all those people who forgot
nothing says solidarity like giving up one of the few remaining progressives in the government change happens inside if it happens anywhere at least as a politician
i d rather she support the people who elected her but we all know why you want her to walk
dumbest logic in the gun debate there s no way to stop people from speeding so why do we need speed limits jesus christ
well a buried gun isn t going to do much and a well stashed gun is unlikely to be used in a school shooting so that s a small win right there
by this logic any crime that still occurs should be decriminalized
username checks out
yeah you don t have to explain to anybody here that the un american domestic enemies will further engage in their criminality i guess the only difference between you and i is that despite the daunting task we real americans are willing to see it through in order to preserve a safe and free country instead of sticking our ass up in the air and wiggling it back and forth like you truly pathetic
worked in australia if people wanted to be criminals and keep guns that s on them
they were protesting with student groups who don t want to die to gun violence so it was the young who began the protest and this is something that will hopefully galvanize the youth into more aggressive voting millenial gen z is going to become the largest voting block in the us
are you unaware of the recent surge in the youth vote they were one of the reasons and weren t blood baths
they ll both be back in their seats by the end of next week
thus ends the party of lincoln who somehow ended up diametrically opposite to their starting position
they can be appointed again almost immediately then run in the special election which they will win easily and likely unopposed
yes there are no laws preventing them from running again next year
their penchant for being willfully ignorant is really going to pay off for democrats
i would feel a lot more hopeful if they hadn t ruined the supreme court now even if the party falls into irrelevance they still have an untouchable body that will be undermining democracy and civil rights for possibly another half century
i mean unless they have found a way to defeat death their clocks are running out and they freaking know it we are watching the dying gasps of a repulsive group of people and one of the final death gasps of really nationalistic fascism globally the world is way too interconnected we freaking talk to each other information is literally at our fingertips these movements aren t sustainable long time because they demand conditions that are not in the modern world to survive
they won t have a goddamn choice
hasn t the promise of the progressive youth vote been a refrain for years now i d be interested to see if young voter participation has increased significantly or if the progressive voting preferences of the younger generations have ever carried over as they age i take little solace in the promise of republicans aging out of power or the next generation of voters to be let s get the current generation of young eligible voters to the polls participate in local politics etc the idea that time is running out for conservatives is a dangerous one because it suggests that their decline is somehow inevitable it is anything but
why not both
it worked in that one slavic country the one depicted in that critically acclaimed documentary hobo with a shotgun starring rutger hauer
gonna need some buff cards if you are planning on running a goblin deck
he ll win but how long until the special election i know ga law not tn
like when they held all three bodies and didn t address the fundamental flaws exposed by trump no supreme court expansion or power limitations no federal abortion protections no student debt relief no price protections for medicines literally didn t do shit when they saw the roe v wade memo they passed two bills in the house after it was struck down and the senate still hasn t taken them up to this day the dems have run on roe for two decades and not once in the many times they held all three wings did they pass a law for it oh they were quick to get bills in place after the fact for a myriad of things shortly after the republicans took the senate back but they all get voted down just as expected and they follow that up with surprised pikachu face why would the republicans not allow us to do this
dem you dodge a firing squad or gas chamber republican you face the above we clear
true that we as americans need to arm ourselves and form a well regulated militia for when they try and cancel democracy
i ve heard a lot of people saying that ron desantis was the drummer for travis tritt while he toured in the s
that part is probably true
actually it was one rival and the son of a critic rebekah jones autistic son shared a meme and was removed from his home by the state and had a gun pointed at him pure nazi fascist tactics she had her husband and her other child leave the state so they re safe then nikki fried was arrested the other day for protesting with a permit
nope they will be reappointed quickly then there will be a special election which they will both win easily and then they can t be expelled for the same reason again oops
its actually quite likely they ll just get right back in lol
pretty good give them the credit they deserve it s better than any generation in the history of the us
actually reading through these comments i do think people are very unaware of this
they should run again i wonder what would happen when they get back in congress if they did run again
miller and coors are also pro lgbtq are they serving russian beer at his state fair

go ahead travis make a big show about how you don t like rainbow things maybe that will make everyone forget you got caught sucking off your drummer in the mid 90s
i know many other artists who are doing the same many artists fantastic artists they re all saying budweiser horrible management horrible company they re saying mr president what a great company budweiser used to be and what a great company it could be if you were in charge of it that s why i m here today to announce in these great patriots and myself we re going to be making budweiser great again and then everyone will see how lucky they were to have had me over this joe biden sleepy joe they call him have you heard this wonderful nickname fantastic now if you ll excuse me i m going to have a well done steak with ketchup hunts only though i don t like the heinz family the daughter is ok pretty girl but the rest dramatically waves hands while making obtuse bitter beer face

these morons are too far up their own asses to realize that these multi billion dollar corporations have done the market research on this they know the impact on the bottom line will be a positive they are essentially saying they don t care about nor need the business of bigots

well bye anheuser busch made the smart business decision the plurality of consumers are supportive of lgbtq rights disney did the math so did anheuser busch progressives are more numerous and have more wealth overall conservatives are a dying breed literally travis tritt kid rock and every other regressive troglodytes can have fun drinking whatever the crap beer equivalent of truth social is
wait this travis tritt https://media.gq.com/photos/5a7506ff24d95b1ac531abab/master/w_1920%2cc_limit/travis%2520tritt%2520super%2520bowl%2520halftime%2520show.jpg) is worried about cross dressers
this would be that virtue signaling that regressives are always whining about yeah
bigots are calling themselves out
oh shit the people that still listen to travis tritt will be so impressed
lol ab isn t even it s own company anymore what a moron
i will no longer except the free bud light that my contract required be supplied to me lol
i guess its not a great day to be alive today huh travis
this is how i ll get people talking about me again can t keep the ol trittster down no they can t honestly he d likely end up making more money if he threw his support behind lgbtqia people and started appearing in drag just for the hell of it everybody would be talking about him instantly
the dirty secret is that no venue pays any attention to the rider of an artist at the casino tour level anyway lol
https://i.redd.it/53hi1gyd7dsa1.gif
if you re drinking bud light to begin with i don t have much to talk to you about that shit is like watered down water
cool maybe there ll be fewer cans on the roadside here in hill billy va
gif giphy t7j5439wv9iq4
i think part of what these people don t get is all these companies be they busch disney nike carhart whatever they ve already run the cost benefit analysis these companies aren t woke they aren t progressive trailblazers they are just profit driven entities that know which way the wind is blowing
travis tritt still tours on what the retired country singer nascar junior league pre race weekend country circuit
travis your days in the spotlight are over you re a c or d list celebrity now and the country fans who will go see you are hardcore bud drinkers no matter what s on the label it s like my mom said as she stocked up on price easter candy on the monday after easter we re eating the chocolate not the wrapper
here s a quarter
ah yes a twice divorced husband getting on their high horse about family values
i wouldn t take this as a serious problem even if i knew who this idiot is
honestly travis who other than you really gives two flying fucks just what you do so go ahead none of us really care
hahaha welcome to capitalism the idea of capitalism is to sell the most stuff to the most people while lgbtqia may be a minority the majority supports the minority which is why their stock price or sales hasn t been affected at all do you really think they made this decision with zero market research they don t care about the conservative spending power because most conservative states are the poor ones who can t buy shit anyway when was the last time travis tritt was even news worthy seriously
wait until they find out what coors stance on lgbtq is soon they won t be able to drink beer at all they will have to switch to expensive craft beers like hipsters
ahh the rednecks of country music bless their moronic covid damaged hearts nearly every brand supports lgbtq ford chevy coors jack daniels and all the other hillbilly favorites all of them are supporters
many other artists a lot of people are saying there s a lot of talk about funny we never seem to see or hear from all these people almost like writing many other artists is not so much knowing other artists that are doing it few if any but indeed a plea to other artists to get onboard so he s not the only one it s a sad look travis
travis twit
he sounds like a bitch no one cares travis not one single person cares i am sure a few cases of beer is really going to bankrupt them lolololol
wait if his fans aren t drunk will they still like his shitty music
i had totally forgotten about him not that i listened to any of his music in the first place meh
lol at trumpers being triggered by a rainbow
removing from a rider what are we even talking about here a six pack per tour stop if he thinks this is meaningful no wonder he s offended by some colors and pronouns on a can
his whole career depends on people thinking they re going to see randy travis
i haven t read or heard is name in years i honestly thought he d retired too bad everyone important in country music disagrees with him
who the heck it jarvis jitt
man they say liberals are snowflakes never seem so many whiners than i have in country music
i m going to be honest and tell all my friends on reddit that i really liked this guy when i was younger some of his music just hit me and deeply resonated he seemed like just an old soul that would ride motorcycles and try to be a good person i m not a country fan per se but his style of story music just worked for me reading this though i realize what an incredible douche he really is now the get off my lawn fuck people that are different than me let s go brandon type of guy he is now really makes the younger rough cut cowboy boots great day to be alive kid i was very disappointed x200b edit removed extra word
and they will forget by the time baseball season starts
tell him his hair and his fringed leather jacket are very pretty
conservative snowflakes love cancel culture
this fucker has no sense of humor i worked at a hotel where he was staying we had promotional flyers in the room for his show we had a suite set aside for him and i used a sharpie to put a big gap in his front teeth and then copied and replaced the flyer in his room he came unglued before the show as he thought this was the promotional photo we used in every room his manager contacted me as i was the manager on duty and wanted me to explain it i said i would investigate and follow up after the show during the show we went into his room and swapped the posters out i brought the good poster to the manager and said i wasn t sure what was wrong but i would escalate it the manager came back and said to drop it he saw the posters too and didn t understand what had him do upset later i learned what gaslighting meant and had a chuckle

who s this now
who tf is travis tritt
damn now i gotta go out and get me some of that rainbow beer
budweiser is king of beers if they survive prohibition they will not hurt at all
someone tell travis that open mic night at the holiday inn in plano doesn t count as touring
weird way to say you hate the gays
it s hilarious all the posts about switching to coors as they have been lgbt friendly for even longer
i love the videos of people destroying a whopping dollars worth of some of the worst beer known to mankind
he s probably gayer than a bill always how it is with these corn pone pole gobblers just be yourself dude
if i had ever heard of him then i might care
poor guy thinks he s relevant enough for this to be a big statement or something
cancel culture is ok now never been to one of his concerts not going to start now either
here s a quarter call someone who cares
hospitality rider specific foods and beverages typically water but sometimes alcoholic beverages fresh towels transportation and hotels a runner a person or persons hired to act as a personal shopper driver for band and crew needs no bud light that s some boycott you just committed to there travis
had no idea tritt was such a twat
i don t want any more of their free beer when doing my shows in front of dozens
i know many other artists who are doing the same a weasel word or anonymous authority is an informal term for words and phrases aimed at creating an impression that something specific and meaningful has been said when in fact only a vague or ambiguous claim has been communicated examples include the phrases some people say it is thought and researchers believe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weasel_word
lol bye it s all the same company anyway but sure switch to another beer
so funny how all these idiots are freely promoting the brand without realizing it
more free advertising keep talking about it bigots
lol he played a small carnival in my hometown in the middle of nowhere i m sure this will definitely make a difference
ted nugent kid rock and smashmouth don t exactly count as many other artists
so travis tritt is alive huh
travis i haven t had an album hit the general charts since tritt is gonna save the day from us queers
imagine being such a closed minded person you will stop drinking beer because a company isn t as closed minded as you
budlight has always been trans its water identifying as beer
got to love these morons fuck cancel culture but also fucking cancel them
james tritt and my trans friend actually have a lot in common grow their hair out have dead names they don t use have billboard top tens or number songs celebrities wanna be transphobic i say we start dead naming them
no one under the age of knows who the fuck he is

getting sober to own the libs is a new one really odd but i still wish them the best
didn t he cancel a bunch of tours when covid hit and they had to insist on masks and such i faintly recall he did and then it was leaked that he hadn t sold that many tickets to begin with i m on the road so i m going to need someone to fact check that for me if they re willing
travis who
dude hasn t been relevant since the early s
lol i haven t heard of travis tritt in forever bud light just made him popular again
just saw a tweet from a lister kevin sorbo about liking busch better anyway or something the same busch from anheuser busch

desantis needs to go
if this was a democrat governor doing this to a child republicans would be actively calling for his murder to the 2a nutjobs
reddit says i can t say all the horrible violent thoughts i have in my head regarding desantis but you can be damn sure i m thinking them
america is awash with nazis if you don t stand up and do something about it it will be too late
is there any independent corroboration for this if this is legitimate it is a whole other level of fascist dictatorship and needs to be approached federally asap edit so yes there appears to be corroboration from the sheriff s office itself i really hope the feds start taking desantis seriously before he finishes building camps for all his critics and enemies
the state taking someone s child is the highest level of intrusion into someone s rights based on desantis man child fascist behavior i have no doubt this was done fraudulently when a fascist goes after someone s family trying to silence them you know they have graduated from fascist to gangster level desantis is nothing short of a redneck mussolini
republicans looking on proud as an autistic teen becomes a political target and is arrested good for you ya ll qaeda we haven t discovered your lowest of lows yet
desantis is the kinda guy who orders large pizzas for himself and rolls each one into a long tube he then holds each pizza tube up like a funnel and squeezes the cheese and sauce into his mouth once all the drippings are fully sucked out he throws away the desiccated pizza bread tubes and confidently announces patting his tummy another devastating blow to the hot pocket wokeocracy
jokes on her republicans wouldn t care if the cops were ordered to murder her autistic son they ll watch the body cam and cheer
of course he is she tried to expose the republican lies and hold them accountable that s the thing they hate the most the republican party s core belief is no accountability that means they can do and say whatever they want without being held accountable for their heinous actions nearly all of the legislation they ve passed is aimed at reducing accountability this way they can keep cheating stealing bullying and harassing anyone who gets in their way rebecca jones is the gop s worst nightmare an educated female scientist who stands up against their corruption it sucks we live in a world where good people get punished for doing the right moral thing it infuriates me to no end and i m fucking sick of it if you voted for goetz over this woman you re what s ruining america if you support de santis or any of the other fascists you are no longer an american to me it s that simple
spread your message loud and wide
the first florida reich has begun those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
i found this https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/
how long before every cop in florida starts with asking your political party affiliation before asking for id or hell make it mandatory on all florida id than if they want to change their affiliation they don t get to vote for years right marge
punishment of enemies as a unifying cause disdain for human rights britt lawrence on fascism https://voxpopulisphere.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/fascism-50-728.jpg)
hey so did a government official just start holding a child hostage
she should whip his ass with a mickey mouse doll
who are you people who are all are we sure this is a real thing and i dunno she seems okay i guess wtf desantis is pure unfiltered evil shithead republiqan and this woman has been through it with him multiple times already for just doing the right thing goddamn if i didn t know better i d say y all were a bunch of fucking trolls
arresting an opponent son for social media posts is something i never thought we would see in america sad day for democracy
we really are slipping into fascism i hope it s not too late to vote our way out of it will be a very telling election
i am with r and will help in any way i can desatan is a nazi my father fought them but ignorance and hate are rarely exterminated only stalled
sadly the people who voted for him probably like that shit
powerful republicans aren t afraid of doing their horrific actions because they believe this is the same level in which they have been attacked in their twisted mind requiring state officials to issue same sex marriage licenses or having consequences from saying something racist is the same level of assault on their rights as literal kidnapping and violent intimidation
the doj needs to get involved this is getting out of hand
look i m a socialist i hate ron desantis for myriad reasons but isn t this woman a grifter she got kicked from her teaching job at fsu for blackmailing the roommate of the student she was having an extra marital affair with tag on cyberstalking charges related to stalking said student she also faced charges regarding domestic violence with the boyfriend she cheated on which were dropped just from what i remember she also was proven to have altered her termination letter that she sent to journalists and about how the raid on her house to recover computers went where she said they busted in guns drawn but mostly because they were trying to serve the warrant for half an hour and she wouldn t let them in desantis is a fascist but this woman has a checkered history and has shown she will bend facts to fit her narrative i m not believing her until something more reliable and conclusive comes to light
sadly i would not be surprised if we wake up one day to a headline that rebekah jones died by apparent suicide from two bullets to the back of her head
there is only one proven way to stop fascists taking someones kid away is a good way to encourage them to embrace it
just to play devil s advocate but the son made several snapchat messages stating that he was going to shoot up the school https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/](https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/)
hello incoming civil rights lawsuits yikes
seriously fuck desantis he is the worst fascist in the country as someone from the state of michigan that eventually rejected the gop brand of fascism brought to us and embodied by rick snyder that ron desantis now embodies florida i implore you to do something about this fucker
florida the dripping syphilitic penis hanging off sick body
somebody who is not me had the correct solution for dealing with desantis i believe it was trump who mentioned that the 2nd amendment people should take care of this
that behavior is what all republicans votes go towards no exceptions i no longer care for their excuses and their blame shifting republicans are fascists if you don t speak out against this then your silence supports it
i hate desantis too but her kid said multiple times on social media that he wants to shoot up his school his arrest doesn t have anything to do with a meme
holy fuck everyone really does have a hard on for desantis he can t order someone be arrested it s up to the county local pd anyways the kid made an actual threat this isn t something that was made up or fabricated see below https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/
but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you
don t get me wrong i live here and hate what this guy is doing to my state but what were the posts local news says it was a bunch of school shooting stuff
removed
ron desantis governor of florida _absolutely_ f ks kids i can t wait until they nail that creepy piece of shit
where do i donate
can someone turn on the dark brandon signal
kinda hoping trump can run for the next election so it ll split the vote between him and deshitass and tear the party down pit the fascists against each other
her son talked about shooting up the school and stabbing students i am no desantis fan but something about this lady smells grifty https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/ you can downvote me all you want and i hate deathsantis but this lady is weird
could this be a case of people believing what they want to believe and taking a wild accusation at face value has any independent source corroborated any part of her story if evidence of this type of gubernatorial behavior existed in any state wouldn t the fbi or doj be investigating it a lot of people bash on the maga crowd for immediately accepting any story they see on social media as truth that reenforces their beliefs exceptional claims require exceptional evidence
been seeing this pop up all day but it s her tweets the only articles from news sources say things like rebekah jones son arrested in florida after allegedly threating to shoot up school stab students https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/ the stuff reported is like okay so it s been like weeks since i got on my new antidepressants and they aren t working but they re suppose to by now so i have no hope in getting better so why not kill the losers at school and if i get a gun i m gonna shoot up hnms lol if mean screw desantis he s a horrible fascist prick but she might not be the hill to fight on
i fucking hate that nazi as much as anyone but the more i read about this in the last hours the less i understand it seems like the kid didn t just share snapchat memes it seems like the kid made very specific threats including dates which he updated it seems multiple classmates were concerned enough for an official investigation to have taken place it seems like the lady herself knows the kid might do something fucked up considering the statement she gave to the police prior to this all going down is that there are no guns in the house and the knives are in a lockbox i have zero doubt desantis would do this but i want to be percent sure i have the facts straight while i blast him all over socials
has anyone actually read any article related to this tweet her son was making threats to shoot up the school
anyone read what all the kid said though aren t we all up in arms when school shooters previously made threats but no one lifted a finger investigators interviewed multiple students who spoke with the teenager as well as those who saw messages he posted on social media in the messages to his friends the teenager made the following statements among others i want to shoot up the school if i get a gun i m gonna shoot up hnms lol i m getting a wrath and natural selection shirt so maybe but i don t think many ppl know what the columbine shooters look like okay so it s been like weeks since i got on my new antidepressants and they aren t working but they re suppose to by now so i have no hope in getting better so why not kill the losers at school the teenager told one of his friends that he planned to shoot up the school the thursday before spring break but there were too many things going on so he postponed it until march rebekah jones arrives at the santa rosa county courthouse to show support for her son following his arrest for allegedly making digital threats of terrorism the students reported the claims to the school prior to that date and the investigation was launched https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/
oh i think those words should frighten mr personality his future in politics seems quite uncertain and possibly short
fuck ron desantis
i will never step foot in florida or texas again both states are terrifying at this point
fuck desantis
what a shithole state
son is accused of threatening to shoot up a school
i want to shoot up the school if i get a gun i m gonna shoot up hnms lol i m getting a wrath and natural selection shirt so maybe but i don t think many ppl know what the columbine shooters look like okay so it s been like weeks since i got on my new antidepressants and they aren t working but they re suppose to by now so i have no hope in getting better so why not kill the losers at school the teenager told one of his friends that he planned to shoot up the school the thursday before spring break but there were too many things going on so he postponed it until march he s already home btw released on home detention i m sure desantis is exactly the monster we think he is but if her kid really did leave those messages then uh sorry that actually does warrant an arrest
context for anyone who believes these were non threatening snapchat memes https://preview.redd.it/0babf96zwcsa1.jpeg?width=659&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a7f78acdff5140b146568258c5f9c6069c600652
did anyone actually read what her son was posting he was threatening to shoot up a school and his classmates
hold the fuck up the quotes of the kid are fucking reckless i want to shoot up the school if i get a gun i m gonna shoot up hnms lol i m getting a wrath and natural selection shirt so maybe but i don t think many ppl know what the columbine shooters look like okay so it s been like weeks since i got on my new antidepressants and they aren t working but they re suppose to by now so i have no hope in getting better so why not kill the losers at school i agree that desantis wants nazi america but uh keep that kid the fuck away from my children
i fuckin hate desantis as much as anyone else he s a fascist fuck who represents systemic issues in america but why is everyone simply ignoring that this kid was reported by teenagers after he allegedly made repeated and consistent threats to shoot up a school y all aren t any better than the opposition you oppose in this regard and it s fucking shameful you just want to jerk your opinions off edit since i m being downvoted https://news.yahoo.com/rebekah-jones-13-old-son-155714689.html
here s an article https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/) that shows what he said kid was definitely a threat
jone s kid i m going to shoot up the school gets arrested wpt deathsantis sending his goons to harass a kid
today i learned rebekah jones is not reliable and has been discredited while it s hard to doubt the current situation and i can see desantis going this far rebekah is not reliable for telling the truth https://www.wuft.org/news/2020/07/22/criminal-stalking-case-against-fired-florida-health-data-scientist-to-drag-into-august/
if only there was some kind of disney character we could name call him to remind him that he lost to disney and remind him that he ain t shit
stay strong jones
i m floridian i live in milton really close to navarre desantis fucked up the red hats are not happy about this
desantis is evil
nothing will happen to him from this although i wish the worst for dicksantis
blue anon levels of posting read the article https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/ this sub would be going it s about it if that kid wasn t in trouble and there was no political angle
buy they re the freedom party
gif giphy edlklymlnfpjc
fuck desantis feels like i need to say that before i say this though isn t this the lady that said she witnessed and also had witnesses of matt gaetz having an affair with a male staffer and then disappeared that and the other messages her son posted look much more damaging that what she posted i feel a week from now people will be complaining about being lied to
the gqp is over here saying the democratic party is sexualizing grooming and harming children meanwhile they re fixated on people s genitals getting arrested for sex trafficking and kidnapping people s kids wild world
republicans are all traitors and so are people who vote for them
https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/
fuck desantis definitely arrested without a reasonable cause no reading the article shows that her child did in fact make four separate threats in writing to shoot up his school even providing a snippet into his motivations in one of them the fact that he is autistic isn t grounds to dismiss these sort of worries
desantis is bad news on a levels but i m not sure if she is folk hero material her son was arrested for allegedly threatening to shoot up his school she s got a very checkered past as an abusive stalker of one of her students when she was a college professor she was arrested for it i don t know why the state of florida fired her but she it doesn t sound like she gets along with others very well
found someone worse than cops
this should have the media coverage of trump s trial we all know he is guilty pay the fine and move on this is a child being arrested jesus h christ this only ends in civil war
you go girl make them pay why anyone would live in a red state is lunacy especially florida hell most of the south yuck
i ve been paying a little attention to all of this but for some reason when scrolling quickly through reddit i read this as desantis is desperately trying to silence rebekah black to which i was wildly confused as to what the fuck he s doing causing beef with the friday song girl
just gonna leave this here https://ssrnews.com/rebekah-jones-avoids-trial-admits-guilt-in-plea-deal/
i take it nobody read the article where the son told multiple people and posted multiple times about shooting up a school
he is a fascist pig
no the republicans love this man do you think they know what fascism will look like for their children
party of family values
fascism enters the chat
see this is why fascists in full control just kill off their political rivals anyone that deals with fascists long enough learns their tricks and that s no good for fascists who lack creativity because they re such miserable shells of human beings
it would be cool if disney stepped in to help her with their lawyers
florida and texas cops probably shouldn t leave their states
she needs to run for office
so many retaliation offenses stacking up the state is going to end up paying her millions
ron desantis sucked on trumps ass so hard his brain is full of orange tapeworm
the kid s autistic these people are insane this is the worst form of abuse of power this community better wake up soon
it feels like the gop learned politics from the godfather bunch of thugs and criminals
anyone know how to support her
everything i bragged about to my relatives living in a third world country that would never be allowed in this country are actually happening fuck this place
does she have a gofundme
get em becky fuck florida and its fascist governor
aren t red flag type laws fun
this is like when people think i am kidding when i say you go into rural tennessee and you will see fire pits with nazi banners all around them just out in broad day light in view of the street
she is naive white woman they are scary black men tennessee
my wife wants to move there because of the music in nashville i told her we have a daughter and are very vocal about our political views why the fuck would we move anywhere south ish
the necessary gall comes with the territory they ve always had this much gall this is edmund pettis bridge levels of gall but that s just another day in tn
get out and vote people
and then allegedly tell her because she was white they didn t expel her i hope these men have grounds to sue the legislature for this honky assed shit
anyone surprised hasn t been paying attention
the facists are no longer hiding tennessee government is now tyrannical what now
trust me the racism here sucks but we are watching our democracy being destroyed in real time these republican pieces of crap expelled democratically elected representatives just because they had the power to it s bullshit and the fact that so many americans are letting it happen is both crazy and terrifying
it s fuckin ridiculous no hate to gloria johnson who seems to be good people
there is a very real racist part of this but the white woman not being expelled when the black men were isn t the fucking shame here the shame is that the guys were expelled at all the racism seems to be overshadowing the fascism and that s just one more way it hides in plain sight they expelled two men for protesting children getting murdered gun reform because the gop gets a shit ton of money from gun manufacturers and the nra yes there was inequality in their punishment based on race but the fact that there was a punishment at all should be the story
was the white woman pregnant and considered a flight risk s
in their defense the woman was just protesting the two guys were protesting and being blatantly black they had curly hair their skin was not as efficient at producing vitamin d as the white woman s skin they knew what they were doing
i m guessing gloria johnson had a couple of semi friends on the other side of the aisle that took pity she dodged expulsion by one vote
sorry but who in hell forgets tennessee is racist
there s a reason the kkk originated there
fuck tennessee republicans disgusting
moved to tn about a year ago am currently looking for a position out of state now
as a southern white male i m terrified for anyone who isn t these next few years are planning out to be out worst please be kind and protect each other from the exhausting and putrid hate that will be instilled from our own best wishes and good luck
what incident are they referring to
lawsuit time
just to keep ringin the good old alarm bells florida is legalizing taking kids from their parents if they re transgender or political opponents apparently republicans have gotten rid of women s reproductive rights in multiple states and texas has made it illegal for men to wear makeup people have to realize that trans people are kinda just the canary in the coal mine here and we should be banning together
not big on subtlety are they
they didnt expel the woman holy fucking fuck can someone link to the way the legislature voted
women have to deal with the threat of sexual violence they deserve a little extra slack
this should be a scotus case
the white wimmen can stay
why isn t more being said about the handful of republicans who switched their votes when the white woman landed on the chopping block
it was unreal to watch spent the whole day i had off watching the news i hope they will prevail through this complete and utter corruption and evil
elie really needs to spend more time in tennessee it s literally where mlk got whacked and church folk there have thrown jesus out and put trump on the cross
it s tennessee they literally sat they re diverse because their grocery stores stuck both hellman s and miracle whip
i wasn t surprised could see it coming from a mile away
has arrested development dropped their new single stay out of tennessee yet
unforgivable
she escapes expulsion by one vote it s not even subtle she got the white courtesy vote what a bunch of weasel shits
yeah the bat shit is hitting the fan now
i m morbidly curious and white enough to almost go see if that s true far from nashville i ve always wanted to go to a predators game
seriously i had to keep my mouth shut when i drove across the country the first time was right after trump won office and the third time was right before he got kicked out of office rural america is filled with some stupidly racist parts in the midwest and the south hell even in new england once you cross into new hampshire it s like another freaking world
proof
florida would like to speak with you
i ve lived here my whole life and been all over the state i ve seen some crazy shit but i m very curious where you saw this never seen anything like it confederate flags absolutely but not quite nazi mad max
i grew up in portland north of nashville you can get music anywhere no need to move there i ve been in nashville plenty of times it s not really all that special
lots of ways to listen to music without moving to tennessee
yep shithole gonna shithole
voting doesn t count for much when states and counties are gerrymandered to hell and democracy is ousted in favor of fascism
i m surprised they were so bold i thought they would have sacrificed the white woman to create at least a little deniability
tennessee government has been tyrannical for years now it s on display for all to see i m embarrassed to live here
abso fucking lutely
be sure to see if any jobs are available in michigan we eliminated gerrymandering and so the democrats now control all three branches
that s not what this is at all
you d be amazed how close rural america is to urban america geographically if you go to nashville those dudes will be around memphis is slightly better in terms of profascist redneck culture
take a car trip around franklin if you want to see trump signs confederate flags and nazi bumper stickers while staying close to nashville the confederate cemetery is in franklin maybe minutes south of nashville until a year ago on the way down i between nashville and franklin you would have seen a statue of nathan bedford forrest first grand wizard of the kkk
this is near chattanooga maybe an hour north in a town called riceville if i recall
pretty much outside the major cities and a couple of miles off the interstates anywhere in tn
you only need to go as far east as mt juliet 20ish minutes depending on traffic or lebanon 30ish minutes depending on traffic on i40 to witness it
even upstate new york is filled with redneck racists my in laws live in the finger lakes region and i remember one of the first times i went to my wife s hometown i saw a confederate flag i was shocked but she was t at all there are trump flags everywhere
try pennsyltucky sometime ugh
i told her we can visit for a show but i will never move south again
but what if you don t own enough flannel to get your music from portland
the bee can t convince the fly to stop eating shit or something
they don t need to they can sacrifice her at any point by saying she was pregnant and had an illegal abortion send a clear message to the minorities first then send a clear message to the women next much more efficient that way
wasn t the white woman from a county without a democratic board so the other two could be appointed right back but she d get replaced with a random r i m shocked they didn t take advantage of that for more fuckery
i ll be looking a few places michigan included
come to arkansas y all
that s like here i live in a fairly large city it has a huge mix of people all races all views etc only miles away just a quick min drive is a small town in a valley that is super pro trump super racist and pickup trucks and cowboy hats everywhere it s bizarro world
i did get great exposure just outside of new orleans and in west pennsylvania pre covid that made me want to see more of that fascinating culture it s only proliferated since i can only imagine
my parents live in southern california and there are trump flags in their area when my year old mom drives by a house with trump flags she flips them off however she does it below the window so they don t see this was a woman who was horrified when i said damn when i was in middle school it makes her feel better and that s ok with me my dad cussed out a guy selling trump flags by the grocery store
that s fair but again she can get music anywhere the grand ole opry is a special venue but that s it there s a live music scene in literally any decent sized city country music concerts happen all over the country and the honky tonks are just like any other dive bar except people are wearing cowboy hats
oh i have lived in both arkansas and tennessee both pretty deeply fucked up culturally
it s sadly not just the south
yeah nah
i live in wisconsin madison is very progressive college town big mix get into the small towns outside the city and it s bad get up into northern wisconsin where it s basically all small towns the number of trump signs you see is nauseating
best country bar show i ve seen was in chicago of all places you re spot on
i moved here from up yonder it s a culture shock for sure
chicago is great i liked it so much i moved there not as nice as boston but boston was wayyyyy too expensive
where was that at i live in chicago and i ve never seen one
gorgeous hiking tho and the trees in the fall oh to die for shame about all the stump humping bootlickers tho
i adored both places when i visited but i don t think i d survive the winters in either
you tested my memory with that question had to hit google maps too see if i could have some recall it worked bub city it was at least years ago and no idea who the band was so it may not be at all like i experienced
that s why vermont is the best better folliage better skiing better maple syrup better people vermont is just better
omgosh yes the nature is beautiful
chicago winters are annoying it s consistently cold and windy nothing too crazy usually but boston was a totally different beast when you got hit with a winter storm in boston your mama felt it multiple feet of snow and freezing temperatures for days and then it would be warmer until it happened again rinse and repeat
i m so dumb i used to work around the corner from there i used to print their menus the menu designer was awesome he d always give some of us vouchers for food there it s a great place
as a canadian vermont sounds appealing
just come out west the hiking and skiing can t be beat and we can buy the delicious vt syrup in our stores
isn t vermont for lovers see that s why it s all better there
fascinating i ve found the chicago winters more unbearable and lived in the area the majority of my life got whacked with a blizzard and nor easter living on the south coast of massachusetts but it wasn t the brutal cold

does that mean trump will get arrested in a different state
texan mom here does this mean i if i throw on my husband s sweatshirt and ball cap to take my youngest to little league i will be arrested for singing the national anthem
this is gonna fuck up the kiss concert in october
is it sexualized conduct when women wear makeup are men who are inherently sexy going to be at risk
i assume this includes orange face paint
so all newscasters as well
sexualized conduct or appeal to the puriant interest of sex https://preview.redd.it/g5nd76yk5csa1.jpeg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c7ace9c148ebc226e85e93f6cf44d38462b2bed in public for bonus points
fascist playbook create a common enemy to unite your base utilize dehumanizing language strip enemy of rights assets incarcerate exterminate
it s actually the female exhibiting as a male that interests me i mean women have been wearing men s clothing for a long time it s literally just a normal style now where s the line between style and exhibiting as a man are all women speaking in front of an audience going to have to make sure they re properly feminine so they don t get hit with the anti trans gestapo i mean i know the real answer is that they will probably never enforce on a woman in any way whatsoever just like literacy tests were rarely enforced on whites because it s all about men in drag but i really want to know how they reason that out loud
so when they say things like the goverment is trying to take your choice away or simply small government what exactly are republicans referring to cuz all the legislation i see from republican led state governments are about restricting healthcare restricting expression restricting opposition and basically restricting freedoms in the name of freedom
okay this is obviously queer people the law is going after at first sight and that is bad enough but it looks like they can make it as broad as they want or as broad as any karens want similar physical markers girls with short boyish hair long haired boys how many bands professional and high school have members who fit the traditional proper appearance for their gender hell how many teenagers do whether cis or trans this can be weaponized against a much wider population than transgender people or drag queens
don t think the movie industry is going to like that
psa cowboys fans gotta take your clown make up off
nazigop should trend every day
what about the black eye shadow football players put on their faces is that banned too
i fully expect people to start calling in reports of any male anchors or actors in the state anyone who finds themselves professionally in front of a camera wears makeup and i d be willing to bet there s more than that too
so they re banning shakespeare now how the heck are we supposed to put on a production of twelfth night now i mean this is a stupid law designed by people who are trying to whip people up in a frenzy and i just can t even with texas
yet they can check kids genitals now gop is a bunch of fucking fucks
i guess that bosom buddies reboot isn t getting filmed in texas then ugh my state is run by jackasses
oh no you mean i am now legally obligated to call and report mtg for exhibiting as a man she wears pants makeup is a product that is marketed to women male news anchors who wear makeup are exhibiting as women because they wear women s products they wanna clog up the system with bs then so be it every texan against this bill needs to call up and start filing reports against the people who passed it and record report numbers you could literally force them into a national argument about the rights of celebrities to be airbrushed and piss off all their conservative wives by taking away their yoga pants only real men wear tights after all
does orange spray tan count as makeup because i could work with that
this makes me feel sick to my stomach how is this allowed focusing their energy in the opposite direction than they should be all in the midst of child molestation and child trafficking by the church and public officials they choose to focus on this and all the people who are just finding themselves have to go back to hiding who they are
so no more trump rallies in texas then
i ve never wanted to wear a dress more actually
how long until some poor pizza faced bastard gets busted wearing too clearasil
but how can that sneak in having a liberal constitution and separation of powers i mean doesn t that cross the limits of legislative and judicial power who is going to put the limits of the interpretation of that besides that are completely subjective are they going to make a moral and conduct police in the purest taliban style a dungarees is men s or women s clothing lol they will have to go on putting dress codes and cataloging clothes and fashion in that law bad times for carpenters
they going after all the asshats with metal balls hanging from their trucks or the sticker or the kid pissing
if a man turns me on i m sending him to jail is how i read some of these new laws
when politicians start talking about large groups of their fellow americans as enemies it s time for a quiet stir of alertness polarizing people is a good way to win an election and also a good way to wreck a country molly ivins
this is what we called months and years into the making of these moves it has never been unclear what they were doing but some people refuse to accept reality until the boot of oppression is bearing down on their neck to finally say hey i think this oppressive force might be fascist
total taliban
death rockers emos goths punks etc no more bands of the sort for texas
it literally bans women from wearing pants if men can t wear skirts women can t wear pants report all conservative mom jeans
maybe it s the fact i suck at lawyer speak but this seem to just be about drag shows and performances in general which is bad enough but how does this pertain to men not being able to wear makeup in public like in a general sense edited for clarifying the question
wow that s some serious nazi taliban bullshit wearing pink or rainbows straight to jail cosplay straight to jail halloween dressing up as the wrong character straight to jail
we are so far past started we re definitely in middle ground just before the rounding up incarcerating and execution and many states have started that process arrest women for leaving the state for abortion life incarceration and or death penalty arrest parents or physicians who provide medical care to adolescents arrest physicians for providing reproductive healthcare to women arrest accomplices for providing reproductive healthcare assistance stop women from crossing the state border to ask about reproductive care intent
serious question are female strip clubs a thing in texas
not all makeup just makeup they don t like i m sure trump will be able to orange his face like an orangutan football fans will be allowed to paint their faces in tribal colors and men will be able to die their gray away but bad makeup will be like pornography they ll know it when they see it more subjective nebulous small government promises from the intellectual dumpster fire that is modern day conservatives
i ve been calling these people taliban for years what a bunch of pussies and weak minded people
it blows my mind how the party that actively shouts about wanting less government are the ones that are over legislating citizens and their voters are like fuck yeah do as i say not as i do fuck these guys
this is unconstitutional right i can t imagine this would pass muster with the 1st amendment
make up is inherently sexual conduct to these people hm really not going far to hide the objectification of women
i hate texas i was born in oklahoma and i hate that place too but it s not keeping up with texas for pure hateful shittiness lately
ron desantis always wears pancake make up to cover up his bad skin can t wait to watch texas gop make excuses for him
infringement on freedom of expression
so if a man puts a little concealer over a zit before going out he s breaking the law hey are they going to arrest trump when he comes or force him to speak without his customary heavy makeup
there s a whole bunch of male tv newsreaders in texas now going to be looking like shit on the news if they can t wear makeup in public
seeing how the republicans are behaving helps me understand how other countries were taken over by religious extremists
businesses need to start pulling out of these conservative shitholes and stop donating money voting has obviously been compromised with a combination of gerrymandering and brainwashing otherwise these guys are going to continue to subvert our country and change into a fucking hellscape
so is wearing makeup inherently sexual for anyone it all goes back to these law makers misogyny wait until they find out that all men on tv including especially their golden calf the donald wear makeup so news anchors in these states are going to start looking their age but it is okay to sexualize all females so they ll be allowed to continue to wear makeup i guess
the sad thing is there are still millions of lgbtq people who are also republicans like the pos peter theil
never had the urge to wear makeup in public but this just makes me want to do it as a middle finger to the state
the conservative war on drag shows is a thinly veiled attempt to criminalize the trans community they could argue that a trans woman walking around in makeup is likely to be seen by a child which would be a crime under these laws it s not about performers it s about every trans person
the poor clowning industry
biden needs to step in and pull their funding federal dollars should be going to states with these kind of non american laws whatever happened to freedom
fascism starts with vilifying and dehumanizing one marginal group this gets their followers used to it then they will move on to more and more groups which don t align with the fascist belief system
it s like republicans want all the makeup and children s genitalia all to themselves
this is what they waste tax paying money on nice texas continues to show what absolute asses they are let s vote texas and florida off and see how they do
does this include spray tanning asking for a dipshit
does this mean you can t open carry concealer in texas
why is no one talking how it specifically targets lip syncs flat out 100mph pedal to the metal insanity conservatives are ridiculous
this is very clearly american naziism but my advice to texans is to not comply the state can t possibly enforce such a poorly worded and overbearing law like this
trump was just in texas wearing makeup
oh someone please arrest cruz and abbot when they go on fox news peddling their shit it s not makeup bitch it s foundation
but in the deranged grand ol pedophile party looking at the genitals of children is fine
i am a dude and have vitiligo and get stared at constantly i have not decided to wear makeup but not having the choice would be cruel
conservatives are going off the deep end radicalized maniacs
idk how this isn t clearly a first amendment infringement
wait so when my young daughters want to practice by painting my toes with fingernail polish then i m at risk of what fuck them i m going to let my daughters paint them tonight and i ll leave that shit on there until it comes off naturally then we ll do it again
is is donald trump gonna get banned from texas that dude wears a ton of makeup
newscasters are sweating their powder and blush off as we speak
i guess the book of mormon musical is now going to be banned in texas
but the children said every draconian shitbag when pushing their agendas i would be more concerned about a child seeing someone with an ar15 than someone wearing makeup
i remember a commercial for i think it was trucks where a bunch of tough guys get into a truck and start asking each other to borrow their makeup they were rodeo clowns would that apply to them all this is just so damn tedious
is this actually real you can t dictate how a person dresses so long as they are not revealing private parts
my favorite part of this is that the state clearly that they find drag artists sexually enticing once again the gqp is telling on themselves
it s going to be hilarious when every politician is called out for wearing make up for their public appearances they all do cameras are not very kind
the tv and movie industry should pack up and move tomorrow
arrest every football player in texas that wears eye black see how that plays out
all of the comments cynically hilarious though they may be about how this will destroy the filmmaking industry ban trump from applying his cheeto dust etc are missing the point these kinds of sweeping prohibitions are practically unenforcable they simply provide a pretext for police crackdown on queer people you seriously think that police are going to arrest heterosexual women in cargo pants of course not they ll raid bars clubs and social spaces lgbt people are known to frequent and use this legislation as a basis for incarcerating them for pornographic sexual conduct or whatever new bullshit they ve concocted voting won t stop these lunatics fascist movements need to be brutally crushed under the boot of the law if our democracy is to have any hope of lasting more than another decade
sooo the governor when on tv will no longer wear makeup
this is gonna put men at a severe disadvantage in the election cycle being forced to raw dog the camera while their female opponents get to doll up unrecognizably
what about trump and televangelists and newscasters
so kiss cannot play in concert there
i guess there will be no hair band reunion shows in texas
b appeals to the prurient interest in sex wtf
just wait until those lawmakers learn that some men wear makeup or even all those other things who aren t lgbt
if men can t wear makeup in texas is trump banned from the state
conservative fascist
everyone report every male host on faux news
next time a republican guy is on tv wearing makeup lock his ass up
the party of small government wants you to know that you have no personal liberties unless you want to own lots and lots of assault rifles
texas is a garbage state anyways
so like technically are all women who wear pants in a place where conceivably a child could be are they all drag performers now and of course anyone performing as jesus in any kind of dramatization
texas please just secede already no one wants you or you dusty ideas sincerely everyone else in america
let s see how that plays out on tv news anchors and actors
ah texas drowning in freedom
what about the local news reporters
how dare my actions have consequences
i love the kind regards hahaha
it blows my mind that people care about what she has to say and pay her a lot of money to do so conservatives love obvious grifters
if i were up for a renovation that guy would get my business
don t you realize i m playing a character
the designer is one david netto and yes owens husband did immediately try to claim it was racial discrimination https://www.thedailybeast.com/candace-owens-reveals-just-how-much-famed-designer-david-netto-hates-her
good there are and should be consequences to being a garbage person legal clarification few people posting comparisons to conservative businesses refusing to service people based on religion should clarify that is is illegal to refuse to service based on them being a member of a constitutionally protected class so david here couldn t refuse to work with her if their reasoning is because she is black race a woman sex or christian religion as those are all protected classes and refusing on those grounds is discrimination however being an awful human being is not a protected class and david is fully within their rights to tell her to kick rocks
lol she claims it s an amoral terroristic issue conservatives refuse rights healthcare and service to trans and queer people but as soon as a designer turns them down it s terrorism
oh are we regretting that policy we insisted on that allows business owners to discriminate based on personal beliefs did we not realize it would apply to us too poor snowflakes
seems that is something the right never wants to accept that their actions and words have consequences they want the freedom to do whatever and say whatever they want with zero consequences from anyone
this is david david doesn t suffer fools gladly david is smart be more like david
somehow i have a feeling the supreme court will say this is unconstitutional yet christians can deny services based on their religious beliefs with impunity
so when a baker refuses services to gay couples you re okay with that but then when an interior designer refuses you service you flip your shit get bent candace
candace gets mad at the designer for exercising his right to deny services also candace https://preview.redd.it/62x8cn6hxbsa1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d43e8ae8b8b167ad9e013a86875e621b1d19dfcf accuses people of being hateful while being hateful check getting pissed about being denied services twice now with the covid center as well check ahh but then justifying hypocrisy with deflecting and making it about something else check the people who claim we should have all the freedom in the world sure do get pissed when people exercise it
do most people actually know enough interior designers to have a ranked list of them
good there should be social consequences for being a large noticeable piece of shit on main
if she sues for racial discrimination will she pivot back to the left again
i really want to know the interior designer that sent this zinger
good man has principles
conservatives fuck your feelings snowflakes also conservatives people don t like me why waaaaahhhhhh i need my safe space on truth social and fox news to be able to console myself
gotta love how they will bash this but then be totally fine with a bakery denying lgbt customers because it s their business and they can do what they want double standards are wild smh
well i d give him my business based on that bravo david bravo
people don t like me when i sell out my race and sex
how dare the leopards eat my face
capitalism can be a good thing if you have something that someone likes or wants then a price is set and the decision made to purchase or not i don t understand why anyone would be interested in what this woman offers why is anyone subscribing to her podcast or streaming service or whatever garbage she deals in i don t get it
great photo of her smelling her own shit
i always wonder how insular her life must be like if you re a shitty conservative you quickly learn you can t really be you in any company that doesn t play that shit so you increasingly have to surround yourself with more and more shittier conservatives and as a woman of color how many times has she had to just ignore the slap in the face racism or dogshit sexism ha ha boys will be boys to live in that shitty conservative world
these assholes never realize that almost every artist craftsman creative basically all the people who make the world enjoyable are opposed to the authoritative and hateful bullshit they stand for go figure
he should have lead her on for months and months and then just ghosted
how dare that private business utilize their right to refuse service to anyone don t they know that s only for christians when they don t want to deal with the gays
can we just agree that if you re soliciting interior designers of that caliber you don t get to claim to be representing working people
this should happen more often and to the average republican voter i hope to someday get to a position in life where i don t have to be nice or even interact with people who hate me wanna take my rights away and legalize discrimination against me i shouldn t be seen as the bad guy for not wanting toxic people like that in my life and yet i get told to put aside political differences and be nice i ll do that when they do the same in the voting booths
good luck finding an interior designer who isn t woke
good i hate her i saw a video of her reaction to left wing stuff one of the videos was of a man explainning his dificulties in society because he was fat the guys atitude wasnt asking for people to say he was perfect as he was or playing victim he was stating that its tiresome and inconvenient to not be able to fly commercial and that in banks post offices hospitals and in any kind of restaurant or waiting room its hard to find a seat and having benches intead of chairs in public places would improve fat peoples lifes this b laughed for minutes straight about a guy with a serious problem like it was laurel and hardy she is just a mean person laughing about a guy giving his opinion that benches are bether than chairs because he was morbidlly obese
but businesses shouldn t be able to turn us away just the people we hate candace owens and her husband probably
gif giphy 633myacwarjkjf4gef that s what i call a burn then again candace doesn t know what getting burned feels like since she s never been to a cookout it says a lot when she was standing in the back of her own baby shower photos
i bet that s true of a lot of people in design and fashion lots of queer people and lots of open minded people they definitely wouldn t want to work for someone who s working against them having rights
candice is furious nobody wants her sell out money i am no shocked
he s a private business he gets to choose who he does business with not sure why she s furious about the free market she so desperately loves working as intended
hey he has the freedom to turn down business isn t that what republicans said about wedding cake businesses
it s because we re conservatives no it s because you are garbage people
lol she s so terrible
same people that think cake makers should be able to choose who they bake cakes for are upset because other companies won t work with them interesting
go fucking cry to lauren spicer about it everyone fucking hates your sellout self candace
consequences builds an entire career on stoking hate in her own country and the consequence is not getting her favorite designer how many of us have ever even considered an interior designer
turns out he s my favorite interior designer now too
there needs to be more of this actions have consequences and if they re going to support bakers refusing to make wedding cakes for gay couples then let s make sure none of these dick bags are ever welcomed in fine restaurants in blue cities stick to chilis in tallahassee
i love the kind regards lol
fuck this bitch and her dumbass husband what a terrible couple i hope everyone treat them like shit just like how they are
lol has she never heard of the streisand effect david netto is now the hottest interior designer thanks to your seo mrs grifty
lol she tried to play the race card if a white conservative male had written that email to an outspoken black liberal he would ve lost everything they would ve said it was like jim crow oh honey bless your heart the response to candace playing the race card from david netto it s not a race thing it s a terrorism amorality thing
oh now you want to force the baker to make your cake how the turn tables
she s a horrible person how did she think being a dick to everyone was going to end
i mean even if you ignore her politics i completely understand why from a purely business perspective they wouldn t wanna go anywhere near her if they do anything that she even perceives as bad or rude she will blast them to her massive audience who will never stop hassling them she s so hyper critical of everyone and everything it would be damn near impossible for this designer to do a flawless job that would be up to her standards and failure would result in being harassed by pack of unhinged people it s just not worth it
imagine having the life where you re upset the interior designer you really want to renovate your house calls you out and you ll have to settle for someone else but the rest of us can t get healthcare
nazis and their sympathizers should just get the fuck out of the united states they re all better off in china or russia where they can hate the people they don t agree with openly and have a literal dictator as their leader something all republicans seemingly want or are a ok with
beat in the ass wow that would hurt so much i definitely agree with the interior designer though candace owens is tiresome even on tv and being around her would be much worse
her husband s one of those christian fundamentalists
i would have been considerably less polite than david
from the you shouldn t be forced to make a cake for gay people
her black cracked i will formally revoke the card she is a cancer to society
who even is candice
so conservatives can refuse to make cakes for gay couples but this dude isn t allowed to not design for a nazi interesting
his business his right to refuse service go somewhere else snowflake
lmao amazing response this is how she should be treated wherever she goes
absolutely would buy david a drink
she s calling the designer intolerant lmao
free market at work bitch
you re gay and so i won t make you a cake all is well freedom i think you re a pos on a personal level and don t want to work with you because of your actions i am furious
i m being cancelled by an interior decorator no bitch you are just an irredeemable piece of garbage and people with a conscience want nothing to do with your bigotry
who is candace owens
what an absolute g
it s the kind regards send off that does it for me gif giphy 3o7acwjavagtbzlwrs downsized
please be david bromstad
i love that for her
uncle ruckus meet consequences
but i thought republicans wanted businesses to be able to refuse service to anyone they didn t want to serve don t tell me they re hypocrites thats crazy
we have the right to refuse service to anyone hits different with self employed service workers
good get fucked you absolute abhorrent piece of garbage
gif giphy 10jhvifuu2gwd6
kind regards has me dying
this is great republicans be like how tolerable of you excuse me tolerable of misogynistic transphobic gun toting inbred maniacs no thanks i ll pass
i know it s like the repairman that pulls up in a work truck littered with maga material and gets pissed when the client sends him on his way it s not cancel culture it s consequences culture what these people really want is to go back in time before being a asshole had consequences
don t worry give it two days for the details to fade and she ll be spinning it as an example of how racist the left is under all the rainbow flags
so weird when the free market chooses not to business with you after you championed them for being able to do business how they want just because you re a trash human isn t it
oh but he could ve accepted the job and done an emperor s new clothes bit with candaces place beveled glass popcorn ceilings to own the libs
looks like i just got a new favorite interior designer too
god bless you david netto i notice that candace immediately played the race card the request reply was sent to her husband and not her like netto said after expect all fascists to be held to this standard reply
that picture is calling out for the old nose fold
i think the thing about candace owens that gets on my last nerve is that she is just a straight up grifter she isn t even a believer in anything she says it takes a cold hearted bastard to say and do the things she does without any real conviction behind it
it s their right to refuse service much like a bakery owner that won t sell to a same sex couple right candice
i really hope it s david bromstad because i can totally see it being him
these people don t quite understand certain concepts for instance they think if they like you then you must be a republican i guarantee you this was probably her thought it s not something she actually thought about consciously she just figured i lived in a red state most of my life and the number of times i would get into a lovely conversation with somebody legitimately no sarcasm it would be lovely conversations but somehow someway something would come up where it was insinuated that they thought i was republican the answer is this their propaganda has seeped into their brains so much that they think they would be able to spot somebody just by the way they look they would be so taken aback and find the person in front of them reprehensible that they think anybody that doesn t fit that description must be republican over the years i ve seen evidence of this like when guns n roses made a post and in the comment section a republican went off about how this was a real band and not some lame liberal band cue the irony and it s the same when that one vice president was trying to play rage against the machine and everybody on that side looked upon with shocked pikachu faces that supposedly rage against the machine had gone woke when the band unanimously told him to fuck off and stop playing their music i think if most republicans could understand just how much they actually are hated and how most of their power is attained by things like gerrymandering they would probably be quick to realize that they are the baddies just look at the popular vote they haven t been popular in a while but yet somehow they retain their power they have completely lost almost the entire genz vote the supposed red wave that never came is evidence of that and of course once they realized they were losing the young vote guess who wants to raise the voting age deep down they know they can t win through popularity while others genuinely believe they are so incredibly popular never mind that most of the world thinks they are trash
she can t see that she is as unattractive as a nazi or a kkk member wouldn t work for them wouldn t work for her
okay i need to save the kind regards for future situations i may get myself into
conservatives i m not going to authorize aid to these disaster victims which they are already owed and which doesn t come from me but from their taxes they paid and i just authorize it as part of the job i ve been entrusted with because their region largely didn t vote for me also conservatives how dare an independent business owner decline to work for me after i spent years fighting hard to take away his rights and generally dehumanizing them
hey they set this precedent this is the whole wedding cake thing turned against them what were the words they used as a business owner they can deny business to whomever they want just find a different business something like that
to think that less than years ago cadance owns won t even be able to attend a regular school or sit in the front of the bus she got where she is by the black people she is attacking right now without all their sacrifice she would still be someone else s slave
insert bad faith argument about the left being closed minded
i m sure she ll be whining about that but when gay couples want to get a wedding cake they have no problem with them getting told to fuck off by a homophobic bakery gif giphy ejycwztdqyxuym2zhj
he s come a long way from giving cokes with pubic hair to interns
i can hardly wait to hear how this is all hunter biden s fault
subpoena his ass and make him take the fifth in public
clarence thomas is a disgrace to the black community there s only one person disowned more than him and that s kanye lol
thomas is invincible as long as republicans are willing to accept the worst of humanity as long as they aren t a democrat remember roy moore
sadly it s a nice gesture but a call to impeach will get nowhere make them accountable by making scotus judges elected officials with term limits
nothings going to happen he is going to stay right where he is because that s how america works
lol his wife helped plan a coup theyre def not gonna impeach him for this
the calls to impeach this clown are little more than performative theatrics you d need a majority in the house and that shit ain t happening i hope clarence made a deal with the devil because god sure isn t covering his ass
don t expect a resignation repubs are way beyond any sense of shame
but if they go after him for crimes they could go after us for crimes
what about fill in the blank
why do these ridiculously wealthy people need to accept freebies
forget impeachment i feel like he should be arrested
they will have a lot of legislation to review and possibly repeal
arrest his crooked ass him too
i was banned from rpolitics for saying how thomas is a corrupt piece of human garbage so i won t say what i said but he doesn t care and has done what his controllers wanted he ll resign retire and hopefully biden replaces him thomas is a great example of how awful and deranged a human can be why must the world be full of such evil and corrupt individuals
ole uncle ruckus is innocent its the gay beer didn t have him thinking straight
arrest
judiciary hearings only have teeth in that they can result in new legislation they won t be capable of holding him to account unless the house would vote to impeach during a future session
sadly nothing will be done republicans won t vote to impeach and that is the only recourse
repugnikkkans crickets
if dems were serious about judicial corruption they wouldn t have put durbin in charge it would have been whitehouse
i m not able to accept gifts in value over at retail stores or the banks and investment companies i worked for but this guy can accept millions of dollars in vacations for years what a piece of shit
this nation is so far beyond dinosaurs like him
it s time to set precedent
this mfer makes uncle ruckus look like malcolm x
it was already known he was in the republican party s pocket and seeing as how they re absolutely blatant with the shit they pull it s only surprising it didn t become public knowledge sooner
when will left political tweeters stop saying holy shit like whatever they re describing is in any way surprising or unexpected
public stoning
scrotus supreme court republicans of the united states
imagine the us reaction to this even being questioned in any other country
i don t have all the details on this but if he wasn t claiming them as income maybe the irs would be interested
do snivellaugh next
he should be impeached but it won t happen house gop under arch coward kevin mccarthy will not hold a vote even if it somehow actually happened senate gop would never vote to remove regardless of how overwhelming the evidence was hell clarance could openly admit he took bribes and moscow mitch mcconnell would still not vote to remove unless there was a gop president who would nominate another federalist society hack
wait to thomas plays the race card
i can careless about impeachment it ll never pass but for the love of food can we please put same damn ethics laws and term limits in place also maybe add a duck ton more judges so our collective fates aren t left to a room half full of christian right weirdos
yeah if we could remove the uncle tom from the highest court that would be good
he should have never been on the court to begin with
america needs a mandatory death sentence for all corruption in the government thomas trump pelosi all corruption both sides all government officials should face a mandatory death sentence no exceptions
do it
tbf i didn t have the black garbage pail kid getting impeached in my bingo card
ok so honest question how is he going to put the smack down on a separate branch of the government what powers do the senate judiciary committee because if its like how congress brings in ceos and admonish them for being bad but nothing ever happens then i m not gonna get as excited as the tweet does
hell yeah let s do this congress is next let s see all the kickbacks let s see how people who make a year have hundreds of millions of dollars bipartisan accountability needs to happen let s start the reckoning
i want to feel optimistic but what is the likelihood that a high court justice will be reprimanded even in the face of overwhelming evidence they are the most untouchable people in the government
this is like that episode where meredith is trading sex for steak coupons
yes like the house is going to impeach their fav
dude clarence has severe alcoholic eyes
durbin can t impeach though actually i m not sure what he can do besides scold him
they will act by passing a resolution that condemns what he did but no significant action will be taken because dems are afraid of setting a precedent that could be used against them later
they dont have the votes to impeach him we have to stop pretending these are gotcha moments as if it s about what s right and wrong the gop gives zero fucks about how corrupt their members or justices are
i wondered if anything would come from this
uncle tom
point his lover ass
this will get downvoted but heee we go reading a lot of the comments it doesn t seem like anyone actually knows what is going on and the title is very misleading according to the story that propublica ran he has accepted trips from one donor for years the only wrinkle is that they have been friends since the s and there is little evidence that this was quid pro quo the justice might be scum but this is the wrong hill to die on and like i said the title is very misleading
illinois represent
healthcare plz
oh fick this is huuge get someone in there on the qquickz
is this so much to ask for if your committing crime no matter what your station is you should be held accountable we might not all be on equal footing financially but shit at least we can all adhere to a particular code of conduct doesn t seem like a huge request to just follow the law
there s nothing they can do they need votes to actually do something
narrator they did not act
thomas must ve known he was in a cage with lions content to let him hang around as long as he provided value but he was always going to end up on the menu
watch this go nowhere fast dems ain t getting votes to possibly bring consequences to a conservative sc judge both dems and gop also ain t ditching the filibuster anytime soon either so all words and no play make this some more dumb shit that ain t gonna have any consequences
they ll keep doing it until we stop them and they won t go down without destroying as much as they can
its quite telling when the highest court in the nation is filled with corrupt justices that can be legally bribed and lavished with gifts while making decisions that betray the core principles of the court
do it tomorrow make him resign then face charges and put obama as the next scotus
old fat guy is yo dems can t impeach him but they can make retirement seem very very attractive
lock him up lock him up lock him up
spoilers nothing will come of anything so long as republicans even exist republicans self identifying conservatives and those that vote them deserve the absolute worst life has to offer i give them nothing but my utmost hatred and i will absolutely put the karmic juju out there that wills the darkest of futures possible for them and their children i don t care anymore i am beyond compassion for those without it themselves
they grow up so fast
wait he did what
i never understood the public hair thing it s unhygienic and gross not sexy at all why would he do that so weird
i don t know about that but hillary s emails were definitely involved
dont forget all the crazy shit that is on hunters laptop
laaaptooooop eeeee maaaails
the gop want to look at children s genitals we shouldn t be surprised that they also want to look at hunter s
oh that would be fun popcorn
clarence refuses subpoena appeals to supreme court refuses to recuse
how about klandace owens
when he looks in the mirror he sees a white man
don t forget rachel dolezal s
have you seen the type of officials who are getting elected our society needs a do over incremental small changes won t do it any more
the tide is turning enough with corrupt republicans who rape and traffic children who line their pockets while their constituents struggle who invent culture wars over sexy candy and beer cans while their constituents can t pay rent cant buy a home are indentured due to predatory student loans they can never pay off who have no healthcare and have to beg on the internet to pay for funeral costs who cut taxes for billionaires and corporations while raising them for those who struggle enough with representatives who cheat and lie and steal and laugh all the way to the bank while the people they represent are given nothing but child genital inspections decimated libraries poor educations abattoir jobs for children and lies about who is truly evil the vast majority of those who are scamming the people and taking the money are republican the vast majority of people who are raping and sex trafficking children are republicans and christians the vast majority of people taking away the right of people they are meant to represent are republicans the vast majority of crimes committed by politicians are committed by republicans the vast majority of voter suppression laws are being written by republicans the vast majority of hate based racist policy comes from republicans the push to eliminate every safety net from social security to medicare to food stamps to public services comes from republicans the youth of today sees this the internet exists and they are able to access information that republicans spent decades hiding from their low information voters the youth of today understands that every other comparable country on this planet provides for their citizens but the republican party has thwarted every attempt to make things better for the country as a whole in favor of getting rich personally the youth of today doesn t want to be murdered at school work two or three or five minimum wage jobs just to survive in a rented home with four roommates be told how to live who to love and what they can or cannot read the tide is turning enough
sadly you re right nobody going to punish him republicans won t vote for impeachment
wouldn t it just be the senate
yeah it s not like he was up to al franken levels of bad
i get why fox anchors say that because rich white people don t suffer for their actions but why do fox viewers eat this shit up i ve seen them on cops enough to know they ve always been subject to the law
it s part of how they keep their wealth
sc justices are not in the ridiculously wealth class at least not based on salary
you don t become wealthy being a sc judge gotta get it somehow
agree at first it was applicable hell it kund of is now but it s every damn day with that now come up with somethin new or just say the point
yes please
i can t see any way that this plan could go horribly wrong or how this power could be abused ffs s
obama would have been executed when he wore that tan suit
yea let s not do that
a resolution of condemnation is important if he has repeatedly and blatantly broken the code of conduct
in fact the gop is saying in private what do you expect from a black man but he s their black man
i think the main issue is that he failed to disclose them it also opens up a whole shitload of conflict of interest issues and we already know thomas dgaf about those imagine what the right would say if we suddenly found out that the judge in trump s trial had been taking millions of from george soros for decades and hiding it
high tech lynching
he sexually harassed his assistant anita hill on multiple occasions the one that stands out to most people is when he asked her who has put pubic hair on my coke but i don t really get why because that s by far the least directly offensive thing he did from repeatedly asking her on dates despite her refusals to creating a toxic work environment by finding excuses to talk about women being involved in graphic and violent sex acts or his own sexual prowess
voting is like driving r to go backward d to go forward
no shit man they want us to live in the 1840s forever
scary times not much else to say here republicans are up against the wall and they know it and are doing anything they can to hold on stuff i never thought i d see
i miss obama lol he s like the grandma that says leave that baby alone when your mom is being a piece of shit
can someone explain what he means wasn t the country built on stealing land from its inhabitants and killing most of them by crazy religious nutjobs oh and slavery
we are witnessing the death of the republican party in the united states it s now official they realize they aren t going to be winning any more elections they will therefore turn to increasingly more desperate means to maintain control and protect their unpopular priorities the harder they fight it they nonetheless realize tighter gun control is coming despite making even interstate travel illegal abortion will again see legal in the entire country elections will be free and fair despite their desperate attempts to disenfranchise everyone else the harder they fight the quicker they lose
fuck civility they re fascists
no lies detected
at this point it s just narration
pretty sure we had a war in founding this nation and another one to keep it
i mean the usa was built by shooting the british with muskets but the sentiment is true
there definitely backward progress r are going for
thanks obama
preach good sir

things we don t deserve dogs mutton lettuce and tomato sandwiches where the mutton is nice and lean obama
barack w
these weren t even rabble rousers looking to stir shit up they represent of the biggest cities in the state and the shooting happened in one of their districts i m sorry but i don t see how an entire political party comes out and says well we can t do anything about kids being shot and then asking kids what kind of gun do you want to get shot with and then basically expelling the people that are fighting to protect the kids from getting shot and expects to survive long term and this well shucks people are going to do what they want and laws don t help horseshit apparently only applies to guns but for dangerous shit like a book they waste no time banning certain books and even regulating who can read them to kids this shooter had mental issues yet was able to buy multiple weapons with no one giving a single shit if they had wanted to play sports though they would make them show their genitals because once again that is what is dangerous and is not government overreach
his post is clearly domestic terrorism hopefully desantis will arrest his kids
my apologies but i ve been without internet for several days can someone give me the bullet points on what s been going on
nice speech but it won t change what happened
ah president obama and his favorite thing civility politics
silencing those who disagree i seem to recall dems suing to have a green party candidate removed from the nc senate race
time to get parisian protesters on repugs ass
he is absolutely right
to be fair the protest got pretty buck right around
legit question how do we get more obama types running the country i m not talking about d vs r why are smart articulate and trustworthy leaders in such short supply has our system gotten to the point that it only rewards bad behavior
didn t obama sign off on drone strikes that ended up in the death of children
obama dealt with a heckler in his rally by speaking to the heckler and trump had the security escorted his heckler out of the venue it s clear that when it comes to dealing with opposition republicans are snowflakes and could not have any civility whatsoever
the thing is anyone in tennessee should be pissed off at this no matter how they feel about the actual issue that was being discussed it shows that anyone can lose their elected representation at any time just because their advocating for them is not a popular opinion in the governing body but most won t care because they like guns and don t like the blacks
it s kind of in their names conservatives want to conserve the old way of life liberals progressives want progress and liberty
i mean they don t even deny that that s what being a republican means
i still wonder how we went from this guy to trump still can t over come just paragraphs
unfortunately in a lot of places the r s have made nearly impossible for the d s to even get in the car
1840s i think they would gladly throw us much further back than that if given the chance much further back
the s didn t have spaghettios grundle spasm medication or legal analingus i know i wouldn t want to go back and neither would my husband s loins
a cornered animal is at its most dangerous
i dont see the lie here
yeah i get the sentiment but the country was built on the very opposite of peaceful protest
no lies detected how about the very first sentence this country was built by enslaved people over the corpses of indigenous people there was nothing peaceful about it
i mean this country was very much not built on peaceful protest if you wanna look at it literally the revolution was not a peaceful war if you wanna look at it metaphorically it was built on the genocide of the native americans and one of the most particularly brutal chattel slavery systems
the british started the violence didn t they something about not liking their loss of tea and taxes
you need a s for that
i m very sad some people seem to not see the obvious joke
three tennessee state reps protested against school shootings in the house chamber two of them the two black reps were expelled by the overwhelmingly republican state house today
elected officials democrats protested lack of progress on the floor of the statehouse they broke some rules of the house and the republicans used that as an excuse to expell them from the state legislature
a school shooting happened that killed people it is hard to keep track anymore a massive protest occurred and the students came to the capitol building it was peaceful democratic reps decided to join the protestors they spoke out of turn or some other similar during this protest which technically broke the most minor of minor house rules that would usually get a mild penalty if that the republicans used this as an excuse to expel them from their elected positions of note that the proposal only managed to pass for the black ones
yes fortunately they lost you re a little off on the motive though it wasn t done to silent the green party candidate it was to prevent the possibility of him siphoning precious progressive votes off from the democratic candidate and in the end it turned out not to matter even if the democratic candidate had received every single vote that went to the green party candidate she d still have lost my own dream for such things which i know will never happen is for the state to not put anybody on the ballots why should any candidates be given that kind of unfair advantage
the old way of life being the medieval ages where seperation of church and government doesnt exist and people arent allowed to be educated that seems much like the conservatives im seeing edit also forgot to mention removing healthcare to the unimportant people
it is so unfortunate that the us only has two major options politics is way more interesting and closer to reality if it isn t narrowed down to one dimension it is also more democratic since more options would enable the voter to emphasise certian issues f e voting the greens for emphasis on environmental issues or a social workers party to fight social inequality
i disagree conservatives love to call progressive policies regressive just the old uno reverse
s slavery was still legal fits pretty well i d say
are you okay
i think he s more talking about the ideal america than the one that exists but yeah you re not wrong
even if we just talk about regular old wars and not everyday patterns of oppression and genocide the list is long and bloody list of wars held within the modern us boundaries in chronological order the revolutionary war the cherokee american wars the northwest indian war tecumseh s war war of creek war first seminole war arikara war winnebago war black hawk war second seminole war texas comanche war mexican american war cayuse war apache wars navajo wars bleeding kansas pudget sound war rogue river war third seminole war yakima war utah war pig war cortina wars paiute war american civil war yavapai wars dakota war colorado war snake war powder river war red cloud s war comanche campaign modoc war red river war las cuevas war great sioux war buffalo hunter s war nez perce war bannock war cheyenne war sheepeater indian war white river war crow war ghost dance war garza war yaqui wars crazy snake war mexico border war bluff war posey war wwii kinda
i don t think people know which side fired the shot heard round the world https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/shot_heard_round_the_world).
oh wow that s fucked up thanks for the info
i believe six three were year old students and the other three were staff
it was to prevent the possibility of him siphoning votes ahh yes that makes it way better mucho democratic
that s some of it yes
conservatives also love to use words that they don t understand they say make america great again a phrase that literally means regressing to an earlier time but call liberals regressives so they recall being called regressive and understand that it s a bad thing but don t understand why so to insult liberals they call them regressives see also fascist
literally how was the country founded on peaceful protest
you gotta watch it it was beautiful one r got super butthurt when a d said that eventually these old white dude would die or retire the crowd cheered and rather than take a minute to examine why the people cheered he just cried about his feelings it was hilarious
do you have a link haven t had a chance to follow this except for cliffnotes would love to hear that
no i watched it on cnn no way it is not on you tube though edit this happened when pearson spoke before his vote the whole thing is worth watching
supporting lgbt is christian hating that is a stretch
budweiser is owned by inbev which has hundreds of alcohol brands all over the world good luck bringing them down with your boycott
bars banning bud lol yeah that ll happen
my beer hates christians back in my day my beer only hated jews and life was great
they don t hate cancel culture they are mad that they re bad at it and when the libs do it it gets results
and they ll forget about it the instant the cans are changed back to their regular version
let s all buy a case and dump it out to show them we mean business
poor snowflakes offended by every little thing that hurts their frail little fake religious interpretations of racism and hate
at least they re finally admitting that they re drinking piss water
so what you drink pbr the champagne of paint thinners grow up
i love it when a backward ass fringe minority doesn t realize that these brands dump millions of dollars into ad campaigns because it drives sales and works them crying about it is free advertising like you couldn t pay random people to constantly talk about your brand the way they do the second they clutch their pearls and start tweeting and posting videos about it
so now they re afraid of beer cans with rainbows on them
the sad part is bud etc have always been selling piss water beer but the flag waving chest beaters used to scream blue murder if you called it out for what it was
bars banning their beer yeah bar owners are going to jump right on board with that
benny probably plagiarized this too
wait so now we re for cancel culture i can t keep up with this anymore
read that again the level of hate of rage that this person is expressing the desire to bring down a huge company crashing stock over what over allowing people to be themselves to be safe and happy to live normal lives trans lgbtq people have absolutely no influence on their lives i don t get it but i will fight to stop people like him
who hurt you betty
i hope dodge ram and ford trucks support the gay community next
how much do you wanna bet they re still drinking bud
at least we can agree it s piss water has anyone clued them in that this same company makes their beloved busch camo cams
just went and bought a pack
i ve got the first round of buds who s in
someone please send him the long list of companies supporting lgbt
are they confessing to drinking piss water
the way they re acting you d think that they were permanently changing the design of the bottles cans they re so dramatic i ll continue to drink it when i m being cheap at the bar
against cancel culture oh no no no no they are against getting canceled but they are more than happy to cancel anyone or anything that they don t agree with
such losers it s cringe
you think they would be embarrassed to be so blatantly homophobic they always claim not to be hate mongers
it s funny the piss baby complains about piss water
christian hating lol
as a gay person that buys a lot of alcohol but never budweiser i might get some now
so he used to drink piss water gross admission on his part
but he drank piss water just fine before
i hope these morons know that anheuser busch owns like percent of the grocery store beer aisle
always on the defense christian hating not minority supporting equating the existence of a group of people to the destruction of another is how you start rounding them off to the gulags
this benny guy is a fucking lunatic rage posts all fucking day cries and moans funny who turned out to be the real cancel party
i thought they hated cancel culture
over a can that says celebrate everyone s identity what a bunch of fascist assholes
lol enjoy trying to stick to your ab inbev boycott https://www.ab-inbev.com/our-brands/
this will fizzle out and be forgotten about in less than a month
maybe they ll just drink piss now
remember goya they don t
it just doesn t seem like something anyone should get their balls in such an uproar over i mean how does it affect their lives
american hating for being inclusive
noooo you misunderstood cancel culture only applies to when someone does something like rape so it s just good american values when it s justified by hate glad to clear this up
bars banning budlight well that s certainly the stupidest thing i ve heard today what bar in their right mind would ban such a huge money maker oh wait it s conservatives that want to ban literally everything
basically all cheap american beer is owned by the same company you can t win this lol
remember when their boycott crippled the nfl oh wait they just bitched on social media for a bit and then went back to watching football these folks can t commit to anything that isn t a second cousin
these guys really think their hate outranks everyone else s apathy
so he and all of the other crybabies were happy to drink this piss water until the company started to support lgbt
they seem to think all people do is sit around and wait for these stupid things to come up most people could care less what bud or coors or coke does they only want to drink their shit in peace and watch their tv or play their games the people who make this a crusade are actually the ones losing as most of us could give two shits about any of it i am liberal and support human rights therefore i do not patronize chick suck my dick or pillow my ass guy or watch fuck me blind news but i don t spend time demonizing them they do that themselves
what will be the alcoholic beverage of choice now for these christian american extremists
eh fuck you benny johnson
who the hell is benny johnson
these dense doofuses don t even realize budweiser hasn t been american owned in years either
it s just so sad these people are being played like a fucking fiddle by the republican party and they re too dumb to see it
oh now you guys say it tastes like piss water this makes me want to go out and buy cases of bud if i actually still drank it like i used to it s crazy easy to chug especially if you re at a tailgate and it s hot anyway this is the dumbest shit ever and i hope more brands start branding their products with pro lgbtq labeling republicans will either become the healthier party or they ll start creating their own shitty off brands to own the libs
how bout everybody everywhere boycotts all alcohol it would make the world a much better place
i agree that it s piss water but you do know this crowd are the actual snowflakes right
now they admit it s piss water
at least he got the piss water portion right
acknowledging the existence of the lgbt community does make you anti christian nor does it mean you hate america but it is piss water let s just all of us agree on that now
so they like cancel culture now
hey dumb dumb not only do they support lgbtq they also make huge donations to the gop it s called capitalism ps they ve supported pride and pride events since the s
gif giphy 3o7abmjci6sizuzpz6 downsized american beer are piss
here s the thing i don t get who the fuck was drinking bud light in the first place and fucking why like i understand there s a certain brand for these kinds of men wearing jeans and boots driving a jacked up truck listening to country music loving guns obsessing over football etc etc it s all very i m a real man look at how manly i am all my interests are manly what the fuck is manly about drinking light beer the only reason anyone in my country ever drinks a light beer is because they are driving later and don t want to be over the limit no one would ever buy a case of light beer and take it home to drink it no one would ever keep it in their fridge except as a precaution to give to the aforementioned driving people personally i wouldn t ever consider an alcoholic drink with less than abv unless i was deliberately trying to avoid getting drunk so how and why did bud light or any other light beer ever enter the template for these tiny dicked snowflakes in the first place at what point did they decide that drinking watered down beer was the manly option
haven t liberals been boycotting twitter once it got serious about supporting free speech
so he bought puts and is using social platforms and conservative outrage to try to manipulate the market
the only reason i don t drink budweiser is because it s piss water
whos with me apparently two washed up music celebs and like other people so far
give it a year they ll be drinking that watered down shit again
hahaha bars have contracts with bevmo they aren t giving up market space because a few hate monger snowflakes are mad also coors is also supporting trans and pride groups as well fuck off
i m not a fan of bud light or most ab inbev beers but i ll contribute to the cause

i never really drink bud light but i guess i will now
ya know that guy just might be a bigot
libs haven t touched that piss water since forever
it s piss water now since you won t drink it anymore all the blows to the head left patches of smooth
good to know they used to like piss water
screw bud light i m switching to natty light
i like how they went from loving it to admitting it s piss water all because of a face on a can
who tf is benny johnson
wait so even the people who actually drink it think it s piss water lol
who the hell is benny johnson
who s with me crickets
and i love that this is the hill to die on for this guy he s really gonna make that piss water company rue the day
if you care more about whats on the can rather than the shit in the can get fucking kicked in the can capitalism means that people who have money are targeted washed up old white hags are no longer the only people that have money in this country and theyre fucking pissed that their little dicks are being sucked off by the kingmakers all the time
remind me to watch for that falling stock price xd
he does kinda have a point though it is piss water
the company doesn t care once your a few deep the bottles look the same or you don t remember
them republikkkunts were so against boycotts that once upon a time they outlawed boycotts against very specific targets https://theintercept.com/2021/11/29/boycott-film-bds-israel-palestine/). hmm
who the fuck s this wanker
wait until he hears how many other brands annheiser busch owns
ummmm who s benny johnson
the funny thing is that an enormous brand like bud likely did multiple studies reports on the effects such a campaign would cause and clearly came up with eh it won t be that bad and will likely increase profit do it maga is breathtakingly stupid like we should do a study on just how stupid stupid
he finally owned up to it being piss water
well he is correct on one minor point it is piss water
can republicans go a single day without blowing out their diapers and calling for a limp wristed boycott that will last less than a day
jeez and they say my generation is the one that s overly sensitive

also notice how republicans are hyper concerned about the political activity of the manhattan judges daughter but don t give a shit about the political activity of thomas and his wife i wonder why that is
investigate this asshole
this guy is a garbage human https://www.businessinsider.com/clarence-thomas-told-clerks-he-wants-to-make-liberals-miserable-2022-6 and i m going to make their lives miserable for years get his ass off the bench edit a word
if anyone in the united states is literally above the law it appears to be supreme court justices they have no ethics rules they essentially police themselves if there is the appearance of a conflict of interest there is no requirement whatsoever for a justice to recuse themselves it is entirely up to them whether they do or not
i read his book my grandfathers son for a school assignment i m black man it was one of the most pathetic things i ve ever read the man is vengeful and sick he s a nihilist he hates himself he hates people who look like him black people and he hates white people who don t hate him or other black people he is exactly who he thinks the black people he hates so much are ungrateful ignorant purposeless shifting immoral and unworthy he should be ashamed and is the meme for the old black peoples saying all skinfolk ain t kinfolk
i wonder how fast nothing will happen
confirming what we already knew he s a bought and paid actor of the system he is the deep state
if it was a liberal justice that was in the majority cons would be calling for his head and so would democrats cons will circle the wagons around thomas
it would be nice if he faced any consequences but apparently we ve decided that some people really are above the law
if we can arrest a fat fuck ex president we can arrest a fat fuck judge
link in tweet https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow)
clarence has reviewed this case and sees no reason to recuse himself
that monetary value is a felony come on people we have the tools to cut the rights rot clean out lets begin
the billionaire s last name is crow the fucking irony
can t wait for roberts to tell us all how scrutiny into the court undermines its credibility rather than the actual behavior of the justices which undermine their own credibility
honestly the fact that you guys even refer to your supreme court judges as republican or democrat is just insanity the entire point of judges is that they re supposed to be impartial
justice uncle thomas
impeach his crusty ass
clarence thomas is the opposite of obama for black people it s insane what a disappointment this daffy duck dude is man
does clarence not realize that he s essentially helping people who want to get rid of his own rights
c mon he s supposed to sell out his country and not get anything out of the deal
forget about impeachment it ll never go anywhere in the current congress he broke the law arrest him try him convict him incarcerate him
we should have listened when he and anita hill told us who he was the first time
this is getting blown way out of proportion who among us hasn t hung out with our billionaire friends and been treated like a sugar baby whisked around the world on private jets and yatchs to tropical destinations just the other day my friend bought me a cup of coffee what is the difference s
the republicans have turned their backs on democracy the rule of law and the united states
women in america have been reduced to sentient birthing vessels because of this corrupt shitstain but docile americans do nothing in any other country people would be taking it to the streets
republicans will never impeach him the bottom line is if america wants real change and cleanup of corruption they have to stop electing republicans
can we finally be rid of him
we are in a post consequences political world
not quite sure how that s going to get a majority of the house much less senate votes when he s in the tank for the folks that would have to vote for that and when those same people would cut off their left arm to avoid giving biden another seat on the scotus
conservatives don t care about the rule of law because it is of the world as i ve mentioned before this is a holy war for them the end always justifies the means i spent my whole life on the inside grew up in a conservative home spent decades in church they will not hesitate to break the law and they will continue to do so until we hold them to account
significant lack of gop outrage over this i wonder why
somewhere anita hill is smiling so hard her cheeks are going numb vindication always comes sometime it takes or decades but it always comes
it s time to kick that white supremacist off the bench
good luck impeaching him you are stuck with him for life and he will live to be years old so thank all of those who did not think hillary was good enough in
i m not reading comments to find this but i recommend the behind the bastards episode on him
don t look at me i believed anita
and nothing will happen
my husband is a judge and a former prosecutor for years when people have tried to send us drinks in a restaurant we have turned them down because it would be inappropriate to accept them two drinks not vacations worth hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of vacations
and of course not a thing will happen as a consequence
it s not illegal when republicans do it because fascism
you mean another law put it on that pile over there
so he s not just a piece of shit he s a fucking corrupt piece of shit x200b i don t know why i wrote it that way i m absolutely not surprised
drain the swamp for real this time
a corrupt supreme justice judge mild shock
what one of the most corrupt judges in american history is corrupt no way too bad they have no rules that apply to them and they can be bought and sold
yeah how about we don t do anything but get quietly furious about this for a week or so until the next scandal comes out and nobody will learn anything so fucking sick of this shit
he s also a widely known sexual predator anita hill was the tip of the iceberg anyone who ever worked with this guy in dc knows what a perv he is absolutely stunning the culture of silence around him
the scotus is a joke it holds zero public trust i mean it even has rapists on its bench it a shame and dishonor
aoc is being investigated by the ethics committee for attending the met gala as a gift and conservatives are freaking out about it im sure they ll care just as much or even more about this obvious abuse of power s
impeach and prosecute the last person who should be above the law is a supreme court justice
this is why it s important to vote thomas is too much of a shit stain to resign and he will never get removed with obstructionist republicans in the house and senate
this is america
i do not care who it is if you are in power and you break the law you should get the highest punishment possible
anton scalia died on a hunting trip at a wealthy republican s ranch the conservative justice grift is a feature not a bug
if you want to be a public servant you should be willing to sacrifice your privacy digital ledger their lives and make it publicly accessible at all times
not just impeach rehear all cases he decided supreme court justices should be non religious monks
see the more power your position within the gov has the harsher and more automatic your punishment should be you should be considered guilty until proven innocent and punishment should be meted out asap oh we were wrong you get an apology and weeks severance for every year served but no you still don t get your job back cause if the accusation stuck so well you were probably up to something
conservatives being conservatives
clarence thomas is one fuckin piece of hypocritical shit just like the scum political party he belongs to
ok now let s see those checks and balances we heard so much about growing up
yo thomas eyes sus af
this is really gross all the while projecting on hilary joe biden obama while their own are rats
impeach this asshole
uncle clarence at it again
rules for thee and not for me massachusetts procurement law restricts government officials from accepting any gifts which have a cumulative value exceeding in a given year even gifts worth less than can be a violation if the intention is to bribe or coerce
we need term limits
a republican broke the law i m shocked
removed
when s the last time these judges went through code of conduct training bribes are unlawful judge
ugh sometimes i wish i had the moral bankruptcy to be a republican must be nice to be able to do anything you like with zero consequences or care
georgia just voted to put up a statue of this dingus after anita hill after his wife and knowing some shit like this is waiting in the wings
it would be nice if thomas can be stripped of his position as a judge of scotus because he broke the laws but unfortunately he ll probably get away with this
forget impeachment it doesn t work if he broke the law investigate it indict him and let him preside over cases from federal prison
what the fuck soooooooo fucking tired of these traitor ass republican bitches
imagine if thomas were a liberal the right would pounce on this
impeach him or acknowledge there is no law
we have to start stomping on corruption corruption should be the harshest punished crime in our justice system either that or violence we really don t want violence but i also really don t want to die because these fuckers keep looting and destroying for greed
lock him up
lucky that jack smith is good at multitasking
here s the propublica report https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow)
we have never impeached a supreme court justice and there s no way that the republican controlled house will ever do the right thing the supreme court fell years ago and we re just living in the aftermath
when a justice s lifestyle is being subsidized by the rich and famous it absolutely corrodes public trust quite frankly it makes my heart sink virginia canter former government ethics lawyer
i love that the majority of this stuff is likely being revealed thanks to scrutiny brought about by trump s sloppy criminal dealings and multiple doj inquiries and yes i want similar scrutiny brought to both sides of the aisle ironically trump will achieve his goal of draining the swamp just by being the largest swamp monster there is and taking all his swamp monster buddies down with him
thomas and alito were reported to be receiving trips and speaking fees from conservative groups a decade ago and there is little doubt that this goes beyond those two i wouldn t be surprised if half the court were guilty of this corrupt bullshit
get his uncle ruckus ass off the bench
we need bigger prisons
shoutout to senator sheldon whitehouse ri for bringing this to light and fighting the good fight
just sayin if this was a prevalent democrat we d be hearing about this for years it would be another deleted emails or junior s laptop situation a smoking gun that would rightfully so mind you be grounds for lock him up
you can t break the law if you believe non of them apply to you these people believe that they should dictate the law of the land but that it doesn t pertain to them or their friends this is obvious to anyone with half a brain
if only the us congress would get off their ass and realize that three of their sitting judges are in the pocket of right wing billionaires brett k sudden erasure of million in debt amy barrett catapulted to the top of the legal chain out of nowhere despite honestly crazy vibes clarence thomas here is anita hill describing clarence thomas s sexual harassment he spoke about such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes she said adding that on several occasions thomas graphically described his own sexual prowess and the details of his anatomy
scotus they have proven by their actions and lack of repercussions that they literally are above the law why is everyone letting all this slide
he s a republican so it s ok
republicans only like black politicians that are corrupt
if you don t have to disclose this then what are those rules even for this is about as blatant as you can get without someone comically handing over a giant bag of cash
note that one of the key guys vacationing with thomas on these trips was leonard leo architect of the federalist society and currently accused of funneling million to his private businesses from non profit dark money groups i wonder if they talked about the citizens united case while smoking cigars
you see my colleague went on one doesn t see exactly where or how to move believe me this is true each act each occasion is worse than the last but only a little worse you wait for the next and the next you wait for one great shocking occasion thinking that others when such a shock comes will join with you in resisting somehow you don t want to act or even talk alone you don t want to go out of your way to make trouble why not well you are not in the habit of doing it and it is not just fear fear of standing alone that restrains you it is also genuine uncertainty uncertainty is a very important factor and instead of decreasing as time goes on it grows outside in the streets in the general community everyone is happy one hears no protest and certainly sees none you know in france or italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences in germany outside the great cities perhaps there is not even this in the university community in your own community you speak privately to your colleagues some of whom certainly feel as you do but what do they say they say it s not so bad or you re seeing things or you re an alarmist and you are an alarmist you are saying that this must lead to this and you can t prove it these are the beginnings yes but how do you know for sure when you don t know the end and how do you know or even surmise the end on the one hand your enemies the law the regime the party intimidate you on the other your colleagues pooh pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic you are left with your close friends who are naturally people who have always thought as you have but your friends are fewer now some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work you no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings informal groups become smaller attendance drops off in little organizations and the organizations themselves wither now in small gatherings of your oldest friends you feel that you are talking to yourselves that you are isolated from the reality of things this weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to to what it is clearer all the time that if you are going to do anything you must make an occasion to do it and then you are obviously a troublemaker so you wait and you wait but the one great shocking occasion when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you never comes that s the difficulty if the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest thousands yes millions would have been sufficiently shocked if let us say the gassing of the jews in had come immediately after the german firm stickers on the windows of non jewish shops in but of course this isn t the way it happens in between come all the hundreds of little steps some of them imperceptible each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next step c is not so much worse than step b and if you did not make a stand at step b why should you at step c and so on to step d and one day too late your principles if you were ever sensible of them all rush in upon you the burden of self deception has grown too heavy and some minor incident in my case my little boy hardly more than a baby saying jewish swine collapses it all at once and you see that everything everything has changed and changed completely under your nose the world you live in your nation your people is not the world you were born in at all the forms are all there all untouched all reassuring the houses the shops the jobs the mealtimes the visits the concerts the cinema the holidays but the spirit which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms is changed now you live in a world of hate and fear and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves when everyone is transformed no one is transformed now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to god the system itself could not have intended this in the beginning but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way copyright notice excerpt from pages of they thought they were free the germans by milton mayer
impeach his ass now
and the least surprising news of the day award goes too
clarence thomas needs to go https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/06/clarence-thomas-took-gop-megadonor-harlan-crow-secret-luxury-trips-report.html
if that fatass reality tv show host slum lord can be indicted so can uncle rukus
how is this not blatant bribery
so something we always knew was happening was finally said out loud wonder if anything will change
rest assured my fellow americans the gop congress will leave no stone unturned in their investigation into the source of the leak they could not care less about conservative corruption
do we get to do a french now
the whole republican cult needs to be burned down to ash they are all bad and the fact they won t do anything to change course is proof enough that they re all cultists
the word i want to use to refer to unkkkle clarence now is a word i thought was somewhat acceptable to use back when i thought unkkkle thomas was being falsely accused of sexual harassment i m glad i left the shithole i used to live in and all the shitty ass racist people that live there
lock them up
the worst part about this is not a single republican will support getting this clearly corrupt piece of shit out of office bc they don t want biden appointing his choice of justice
it was not a gift it was like if my neighbor let me borrow his truck to go to home depot except the truck was a fully staffed luxury yacht and the home depot was an island hopping adventure for nine days same thing
i m shocked shocked well not that shocked
wish i could say i had enough faith in the us political system for this to actually lead to something but i don t
term limits people
gif giphy 3ohhwgb6bpa8jh0miq downsized
wasn t it obvious when citizens united passed
nothing is going to happen
didn t he also donate 500k to a grassroots organization started by ginni thomas where he salary was 120k yr
biden needs to appoint progressive justices today any democratic senator that threatens to stand in the way is told that the faucet of all democratic money will be turned off if they don t vote to confirm reverse the citizens united decision and watch how quickly all of the conservatives gains in the last years rot overnight money is the root of our political fucking problems
no shocker there
we can confirm that one is and we ve got strong suspicions about at least one more
that seems wildly illegal can t wait for there to be absolutely no punishment
the gop is un american with a few exceptions their members have no honor and act exclusively in bad faith they are a cancer on our nation
tar feathers and a rail come to mind
and yet this small handful of individuals is allowed to make decisions that affect every single person in this country
gif giphy fbb4ehll5vlak
does this mean we can get roe v wade overoverturned
was this not already common knowledge we ve all known for years now that the upper echelons of politics are irredeemably corrupt comedians have been making jokes about it for decades the only thing that s changed is they don t feel the need to hide it anymore why would they the only people with the power to do anything about it are right there in the mud with them
what are the legal ramifications here are there any laws broken or is this one of those situations where it s simply an ethics failure or is it just bad optics what do justices agree to i feel like we just expect professionalism and impartiality and an unshakable understanding of what is right and wrong in law and and life seems like lobbying supreme court justices should probably not be allowed in any degree what a shithole country we have become i worked for the feds for much of my life us dept of interior and attended ethics training every few years as a national park ranger i was not allowed to accept any gifts valued greater than like ten bucks or something at risk of my job no cash at all ever a free cup of coffee was okay but that s about it
bought and paid for not reported as i am sure they are supposed to be based upon the reporting requirements for other senior gov t officials bribes and conflict of interest are just standard practice for fascist rw maga t s
conservatism and the republican party seem to be imploding if not for obvious enough reasons i can t imagine a world where any majority wants them in charge i mean i can imagine it it was kind of life until this point but in the process of enriching themselves they seem to have forgot to convince the rest of us it was for our benefit
ok but didn t his wife have a hand in trying to overthrow the government
give me a second to make a phone call then i ll tell you how i stand on this issue
i hope to the surprise of no one if they are involved in government they are corrupt if they moved up the ladder it was because corrupt people promoted them the more corrupt they are the easier the job is and the longer they d want to stay in it if you still believe in the myth of meritocracy in the us you are mentally living in disneyland
looking at his pic close up all i see is uncle ruckus from the boondocks
what a surprise this guy has always been a pos
throw them all in a sack then throw the sack into a river then throw the river into space
oh they will investigate themselves and will find no wrongdoing
so the republicans george soros let s just start calling him out constantly oh wait we don t have fox news
shocked utterly and totally shocked
considering that these gifts were worth up to each time shouldn t they be subject to the gift tax therefore wouldn t thomas be guilty of tax evasion
impeach him
is is this supposed to be a shock everyone in power is bought and or paid for that s part of capitalism
bribery go straight to jail
how the fuck can you go on so many luxury vacations and still be such an insufferable piece of shit
we are gonna need a new school house rock
america needs a hero like jack ruby
they re on a payment plan yearly payments gotta remind them who writes the checks
america is a failed state time to burn it all down

this doesn t happen in america that s for poor corrupt countries
crow is another trumpublican that was born on 3rd base and thinks he hit a home run
over 500k trip and he still looks like shit
this is the swamp
sounds like a comic book villain name
one supreme court justice is bought and paid for
a trio of disgusting rats
your surprised
he should absolutely be held accountable for this but is it really bribery when already have the same opinions he probably feels it is all and earned reward for doing good work
always has been
nothing will come of this
is anyone surprised by this
the whole country knew he couldn t be trusted before he was ever confirmed
a great example of follow the money
maybe he will get invited to a putin party and fall out a window
time for impeachment while we have the senate
where did harlan crow get his money
shockers the pubes on a come can guy is a corrupt asshole who would have known
ju tice thoma
anyone know if there s been any outrage by republicans and maga on this they were suppose to drain the swamp anyway right
we knew that in because of the citizens united ruling which has done more damage to our democratic process than anything else
why is this surprising anyone and everyone in politics are lining eachothers pockets they are all bought way or another
not surprising i m sure there are tons of backroom deals we don t see we don t have a democracy haven t for a while
yeah well george soros many republicans out there
just goes to show a gift is just a grift without the r
i make that same face when i can t find a matching sock after doing the laundry
surprise
parasitic scum
what is actually going to come of this information
all politicians are bought and paid for don t really understand how this facade continues
how do we normal citizens do anything about this
it s almost as if the entire shitty system of government we have is rotten from the foundations and needs to be utterly destroyed and replaced
y all stop giving this political system your time and energy put it into your communities and your habitats because the solution to our current problems isn t going to come from politicians or the economy y know because they _are_ problem
and there s absolutely zero we can do about it because our system never accounted for a party full of corruption that refuses accountability
uncle ruckus and christine baskets strike again
this should carry a life in prison sentence
it s so cheap to buy a supreme court justice i wound think it would cost million
here s the original groundbreaking story propublica https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow) this is how the 4th estate holds the powerful to account
you mean ginni the jan 6th traitor that ginni
roberts money talks scotus should have a banner above it that says pay for play or in latin quid pro quo
hmmm i d expect to see some republican outrage here no bunch of fucking hypocrites
he needs to resign and pay the people back for the salary he stole while he pretended to serve the country for all of these years
america needs a mandatory death sentence for all corruption in the government thomas trump pelosi all corruption both sides all government officials should face a mandatory death sentence no exceptions
impeach disbar and indict him then lock him up
bribes influence peddling undeclared gifts corruption supreme let me guess none of this influences his decisions
gop leaderships response to these accusation so what
has he ruled on anything that would benefit harlan crow
years of rulings need to be re evaluated as soon as this pos is removed from the bench
where is the republican outrage about breaking laws
and nothing will be done about it being disruptive gets you removed being corrupt however is ok
hey travis here s a quarter now go call someone who cares
everything about this guy screams i m a homosexual country boy trapped in the closet
looks like he s hiding in the closet
travis tritt and lindsey graham seem like they have a lot in common
if he s boycotting because he hates homosexuality he ought to rethink his poses that s what grindr photos would ve looked like had it been around in the s my thought is he doesn t hate gay people he s hates himself because he s gay but denies it
hmmmm which is it trav williams also touched on controversial topics in country music including openly gay singer steve grand garnering national attention recently tritt responded the thing that makes country music so universal is the fact that it appeals to a wide swath of people regardless of what your social background is what your social status is what your race is your gender is https://travistritt.com/news/video-travis-tritt-chats-with-wendy-williams/
ummmm anyone wanna tell him with that hair and goatee he looks like a woman from one of his farm emo songs
no way he s fitting a phone in those pants pockets
i smell t r o u b l e
his posture and body language sends a dangerous message to kids i think we should grassroot for a federal ban on this type of expression
that hair those pants the turquoise fringed jacket oh honey don t hate on queens just because they re using your style
yet another famous person trying to drum up conservative outrage because they are desperate to recreate long dead glory days
in the s dorothy thompson wrote an article detailing the kinds of people to watch out for the kinds of people who if the choice became available would choose to go nazi absolutely none of the personality types have changed at all in the years since they are still instantly recognizable i highly suggest people familiarize themselves with it and be prepared for the people in their life who will choose to go nazi
country singing power bottom who s still in the closet
i don t judge but that dude looks so deep in the closet he s finding christmas presents
she is adorable
and when comes out he will be welcomed
fuck man this guy wrote one of my favorite country songs of all time great day to be alive sad to hear hes a peice of shit
damn i looked at the images first and i would have bet solid money the writer would have said supported rather than boycotted without the goatee this person looks like they run a craft store in denton or lubbock tx and plays in a heart cover band
is this what a hypocrite looks like
his tens of fans will be devastated
he looks like nandor the relentless s dweeby brother
girl looks like a cashier at food lion
m kay bye now
this might hurt ticket sales for his upcoming tour of county fairs holiday inns and waffle houses
he s taking time out from playing county fairs and tractor pulls to do that anything for another moment in the spotlight i guess
has this guy been relevant at any time since that denim vest was in style better watch out he s a smoothing it
funny i ve boycotted travis tritt for some years now
he s making me uncomfortable can we ban him
didn t he get caught sucking his drummer s dick in the 90s
didn t he give his drummer a mouth party back in the s
why does he look like a 80s rocker mom getting ready to see van halen
i don t really take advice or social guidance from dudes with mullets
he s so sassy
have a good ol laugh at this interview from nearly years ago with tritt and fellow closeted homosexual marty stuart where they discuss spending time together down in key west pretending to be straight while visiting all the gay stores a true bromance a brokeback mountain relationship if you like hilarious http://www.martystuart.com/zart-cm9-96.htm and just listen to how straight he is https://youtu.be/xj0vl3g2dyy
he s literally coming to my town and playing the hall i used to have ballet recitals in that s how relevant he is these days
ironic that the two pictures provided of him could easily be grindr or gay dating website pics
bold words from someone who looks like a live laugh love wine mom
it s like tiger king and joe dirt had a child who became a wrestling heel
that s a lot of tassels for a straight man
the projection is strong with this one
based on these pictures he looks like he is lbgtq
um travis it s time to come out bro
definitely gets pegged
uhh is anyone going to say it
yknow the guy with a perfectly coiffed mullet and multicolored leather jackets with frillies all around them loves tight jeans
why is he posing like he s a teen girl doing senior pictures
he s gayer than a handbag full of
i try so hard to never make this kind of assumption about someone from appearance alone but i m sorry travis tritt is richard simmons level of obvious
well i guess ill have to return my dollar travis tritt tickets to the chinook winds casino 6pm tuesday show
doesn t like gays but chooses to look like that hmm
ironically he looks like the overweight unhappily married soccor moms i see in walmart on sunday afternoons with their equally overweight kids
fancy man
he s not ready to come out yet
looking like he s cosplaying as tanya tucker circa
this is the same guy caught giving his drummer a blow job many years ago
dear travis here s a quarter call someone who cares
denial ain t just a river in egypt
ok
honestly anyone who is against love is the darkside of pan
oopsie looks like he already drank too much bud light
does he really dress like that or are these shopped
travis big azz titties tritt
more like travis titt
cynical move on his part to gin up some support from the fox news maga troglodyte crowd those outrage addicted idiots must bankrupt themselves every time a controversial marketing decision like this is made they already bought a shitload of expensive craft pilsner from their local veteran owned anti woke craft brewery then they bought tickets to kid rock s let s go brandon tour as well as his anthology now they ve got to pay ea for tickets to see travis tritt at their local casino and his back catalog is extensive that s gotta be at least figures worth of cds including the various greatest hits and holiday releases
here s a quarter travis
ok glamour shots
if i stop drinking bud light will that help hide my hidden gay desires
tritt stated that beginning in he was awakened regularly by disembodied voices in a vacation cabin that he owned the voices spoke in an unknown dialect over the years these voices started happening on such a frequent basis that we were afraid to come up here he also asserted that footprints once appeared in the carpet of the cabin and imprints in the bedspread that belonged to neither him nor his wife
while dressed in drag
hate is irrational but there is a logical consistency behind it projection hate is a personal thing i hate a bunch of things for stupid and deeply personal reasons i don t expect others to share my hatred implicitly and it s not my business if people like what i hate that s normal hate at least insofar as it s never driven me to acts of violence i avoid forget about or make fun of what i hate the less presence it occupies in my conscious experience of life the better what they hate the most is their own reflection seeing other people living in a way they want to but feel they can t because of some dogmatic belief this hatred that motivates to violence is the most unadulterated projection there is it s not about protecting children it s about protecting their fragile ego and the fragile belief system it relies upon these nobodies are all the same unable to live their truth because of their pathetic ideology and pissy about it
when was the last time he was relevant why do we care what singers think
just mom jeans doing mom things
and somehow civilization will survive
him crying into his closet doesn t change the fact that he s a nobody anwyay
travis is a pretty girl
oh no i love that one song
says the guy who wears more make up than the average woman
he is such a fruitcake
what is a travis tritt
he looks super fabulous in these pics has he checked his surroundings he may be in a closet
travis who
bet by percentage he s losing more than bud on this and by a wide margin even if there s only a few former tritt fans who will no longer spend dollars on him that s gotta hurt like hell
who is boycotting who
he looks like his nickname would be twinkle toes so
i didn t know he was still alive
who
i m solely judging him based on these two images alone but it looks like he hates a part of himself he would be much happier getting to know
travis looks like the human embodiment of your partners hair you have to pull out of the drain when it s clogged
yaaaasss queeeeen
he slayed the blue leather tassel jacket
who is this lady and why is she so upset
travis twit who s that
second pic looks just like mom
he s still alive
who
who is this
this reminds me of when the tightie righties set their yeti coolers on fire like bruhs they already got your money don t be a wasteful idiot i too am continuing my boycott of anheuser busch but not because of lgbtq i m all for supporting that it s just horrifically disgusting beer
dunno this guy looks pretty gay to me
he looks totally straight and fabulous
and if that s not a enough good reason for you as a consumer and client of twitter to exercise your purchase power afforded to you by the free market and leave the platform or not advertise on it nothing is because by continuing to support it you re giving your tacit support to shit stains like that
also i feel this particular anvil needs to be dropped x200b https://preview.redd.it/oson22o8hbsa1.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b7af2eaee6b9122ad10989c59a7ebc23ba60ea19
just deleted my twitter account bye nazis
it s crazy when even the nazi who is verified is like can you believe this shit even they find it weird and wrong that they are allowed to have a verified platform
if you are still on twitter it is time to go now
i believe we found a cure for nazisism back in the 1940s perhaps it s time for a re inoculation
race pride the last resort of the hopelessly mediocre
there s no way they got this much growth without help from twitter and how fucked up is that this is all elon all
verified that they have dollars to pay
i hope these fuckers realize that there is absolutely zero scientific or biological evidence for their belief in white supremacy i m just saying because some anvils need to be dropped and thats a big one preferably right on their heads
nazis openly operating on twitter musk seems fine with it
elon musk is a hitler loving fascist
this is gross
how does one delete a twitter account
uhm yeah there are a lot of fucking nazi s on twitter holy shit his replies and comments
elon musk helps his friends who help him
i am so glad i deactivated my twitter the other day as soon as i saw musk change the logo to doge i knew that hellsite was over for me what little value twitter had has been absolutely destroyed by musk
probably the wrong sub for this but get the fuck off twitter tell your friends
removed by reddit
they probably paid to get that profile pushed to more people i ve tried old school guerilla tactics of posting a ton of hashtags to drive views it barely works maybe a handful at most
and yet putin is their guy because he s fighting nazis
yeah i ve seen some surprising things on there lately still i like my racists to identify themselves let ignorance stand up and get the attention it needs for others to see how degenerate of a mentality it is hiding it away gives it power makes it look like decent folks are afraid of it like we have no answers for it
people time to take a stand there is no go along to get along here get off twitter now if you are stilll on twitter you are helping it push nazi ism
delete your twitter account
deleted my year old account about a month ago it was a cool place for a while and a bit hard to do because you feel a sense of your personal history go but good riddance twitter is now a toxic garbage dump with an aggrieved manbaby at the helm
i clicked on a twitter link and was brought to the twitter website my own account has been permanently suspended for impersonating elon musk so i m looking without a sign on and it s literally two posts from catturd travis whatever bitching about bud lite and four other right wing bullshit accounts it s truth social people get off
wait but the nazis weren t socialists they were just fascists who had it in their party name for some reason right i mean the profile name looks like they advocate for eugenics and racism so they re obviously a nazi
twitter is now simply an echo chamberfor musk to directly talk to the stans
just blows my mind that nazism actually appeals to anyone i guess i kind of understand it from the shitbags authoritarians who are already in power i expect them to be trash and i understand that many people are extremely stupid but nazism is not just stupid it s evil
anyone complaining about this and still using twitter is part of the problem
try spoutible com it s new and so similar to twitter that it s easy peasy to navigate it not full of nazis either
i m actively leaving this sub because even just participating here you re allowing twitter to remain viable i recommend everyone just bounce and we make a new white people social media or something more clever
didn t musk grow up in apartheid environment and y all shocked
i deleted it last week so glad i did fuck elon
kinda begs the question why are people still on twitter their involvement promotes white supremacists account at this point it s more show boating and addiction to social media
maybe we need to start boycotting companies who advertise on twitter
just stop using twitter lol point blank
i hope someone leaks all the paid members details online then i can send this guy a box of shit
enrique tarrio is a real life clayton bigsby elon musk is his enabling assistant
bots are still a thing seems inflated so the goons can pretend they are popular and increase their bullshit brazen open hatred toward others if you re a nazi you should do humanity a favour and kill yourself
we re finding out in real time what the lead up to ww2 would have been like had twitter existed back then
damn dude fuck elon for letting the sess pit platform nazis racists and fascists
is there actually any real difference between this guy and tucker carlson just asking questions
conservatives are all nazis
ditch twitter
and this is why i deleted twitter when elon bought it
twitter is so bad like the people who comment the most sound so fucking evil it s almost comical
anonymous needs to investigate twitter more thoroughly i mean really send all of their specialists to take a close look
i think it s time we start breaking a few skulls
still trying to figure out why we haven t collectively stopped using that app
i ve never used twitter to begin with
kinda makes it all seem pointless right maybe that s the point
hey look its the king of the meth heads
what i have come to find to be the greatest and most effective and successful weapon that we can use known to man to combat such adversaries as ignorance racism hatred violence is also the least expensive weapon and the one that is the least used by americans that weapon is called communication daryl davis https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/daryl_davis
is apple still giving them ad money
i haven t logged on to my twitter account in a long time but i m definitely logging in just to delete it now update now that that s done last time i was on twitter was it s not like it was doing much
what are the best micro blogging alternatives to twitter that most people can or will switch over to
to be fair most of the people still on twitter nazis who the f in there right mind still uses twitter
elon must be so proud
racism is a mental disorder
when are people going to realize that elon is just as redpilled as these crazy idiots stop encouraging his platform leave
everybody needs to exit this platform asap seriously
i will never understand why elon did this
just delete twitter get off that shit holy fuck
hope any advertisers crazy enough to be thinking of returning are taking note of this
but being mean to elon musk will get you banned
fuck musk i avoid twitter like plutonium
twitter can fuck all the way off
i dropped twitter shortly after it got musky and didn t really use it much before that but just because it gets pushed out doesn t mean you have to follow it does it i mute subs reddit pushes out unless i am actually interested in the sub which is exceedingly rare can t you do something similar on twitter
the 8chanification of twitter is here
fuck elon musk
no company should have an ad on that cesspool site at this point
i m over hear worrying about the alphabet boys seeing my posts when i abbreviate cyberpunk and these jabronis are scheduling lynchings around the police s schedule faith in the system no thanks
twitter surely you mean the runescape customer support website
well i m glad i never really gave twitter the time of day to begin with
send this to the advertisers
people should stop using twitter
i left that joke of a platform the day the elon deal was official glaringly obvious what was going to happen
delete twitter
i got kicked off of twitter when musky took over and was fine with it did not like what i was constantly shown anyways seemed like musky had an agenda never had a violation in the previous years before that don t think my views aligned with his
thanks for making the world a lot shittier everyday elon such a hero
some voices don t deserve a platform it s a fine line but one worth maintaining oh and f ck twitter it was always a cesspool
one platform i never saw the need to invest any time on
free speech absolutism unless you hurt elon s feelings obviously
i mean i hate the preacher that stands on the corner at college saying everyone is going to hell but if you ban him you re banning free speech that s how it s always been but now twitter is the new public square were rehashing the old argument of getting rid of the dumb ass preacher just because we want to
i love that liberalism is tolerant of this shit in the name of civility and peace
bluesky just let me on fuck twitter
isn t white people twitter the same thing
give up on your past we stood up to nazis whiles oppressing the black man and woman american acknowledge your sins make real amends
does anyone have know of a potential viable alternative to twitter spoutible anything
maybe delete this subreddit and get off twitter you keep giving them an extended platform seems like the people the most against twitter are the ones who seem to be unable to get rid of it enjoy your addiction
not sure what twitter account you re talking about but the national socialist german workers party was not socialist now if the account in question is actually a nazi account then yeah that s bad but ultimately it s up to users whether they want to believe trust what they say or not
well hate to say it but you have a choice to either be on there or not don t drag me lol
is that not democracy and freedom of speech
i mean of reddit posts are just screenshots of twitter this post included why upvote twitter screenshots
if u think is bad dont tell these guys about the billions sent over to those nazi in ukraine
thank you elon for doing your part to protect the voices of all americans especially those we strongly disagree with there is no one person who holds moral authority of speech over another
i am pretty sure you can block notifications from any group or person that you want
there s pros and cons to free speech overall i d rather them be in the open where we can see them and dispute them than them be in the shadows whispering
so what can we do to ban free speech from people we dont like asking for a government
i just don t understand how this is legal they are allowed to kick somebody out because they disagree he protests on the floor and they kick him out but not her for doing the same thing
blatant white supremacy authoritarianism in the gop
need to send in the feds i m in tn and this is appalling even calling for their expulsion was appalling but this is so far beyond the pale just staggering
possibly racist where the fuck is that possibly coming from when it is blatantly and completely obvious this is racism
surprised she didn t breach decorum with that answer the skin is so thin on these scumbag republican facist representatives they are translucent
until someone offers another explanation this is what i m going with they all did the same thing how was she not expelled as well
we are witnessing the death of the republican party in the united states it s now official they realize they aren t going to be winning any more elections they will therefore turn to increasingly more desperate means to maintain control and protect their unpopular priorities the harder they fight it they nonetheless realize tighter gun control is coming despite making even interstate travel illegal abortion will again see legal in the entire country elections will be free and fair despite their desperate attempts to disenfranchise everyone else the harder they fight the quicker they lose
this is the same legislature that reprimanded pearson for daring to wear a dashiki on the house floor because they felt it was unbecoming attire for a representative it should come as no surprise how shitty the state legislature is and it angers me that they are doing this to pearson and jones
no this does not sound about white this is not white people shit white people shit is the cha cha slide and going oop as we go around people this is fascist behavior that should incite large protests
it is such a mystery
i genuinely don t understand why people are surprised
when did fascist loose its meaning idiots toss it around and it cheapens the word in every way for click bait racist yes fascist slow down cupcake
the fact that she can t even or won t say it outright speaks volumes really exposes how white women are conditioned to be quieter in our protest which is exactly how she survived the vote she wasn t holding a megaphone at the protest they all broke the same rules blatant racist dis enfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of people in tn unfolding and still as a white woman leader in this moment she can only keep coy keep tip toeing around the her problems with the big dogs that she still has to go play with she feels the need to play coy and she has the privilege to play coy so when she goes back to the office with all the good old boys at least she didn t say anything as damning as the black folks i hope people recognize just how dangerous it is don t get me wrong i commend her courage of action and one thing for sure this is an inflection point for the movement power
possibly
it s tn that makes it legal if they want it to be legal i grew up there not much but the names have changed
i think basically they ll be reinstated within a few weeks temporarily to their own seats then they will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on special elections for these seats i m sure both expelled members will win again but still it s such a complete abuse of power
it s legal because the state s constitution says it is each house may determine the rules of its proceedings punish its members for disorderly behavior and with the concurrence of two thirds expel a member but not a second time for the same offense and shall have all other powers necessary for a branch of the legislature of a free state tennessee constitution article ii distribution of powers section https://law.justia.com/constitution/tennessee/article-ii/section-12/](https://law.justia.com/constitution/tennessee/article-ii/section-12/)
and it s perfectly legal under the state s constitution https://law.justia.com/constitution/tennessee/article-ii/section-12/](https://law.justia.com/constitution/tennessee/article-ii/section-12/)
she s already on the edge of breaking decorum with that statement if she gives them any sort of excuse they could just vote again and kick her too
innocent until proven guilty yada fuckin yada still absolutely fucking abhorrent
i mean it s about fascism and discrimination specifically the discrimination of two black elected leaders that is what inherently white people shit
they removed people from office because they disagreed with them that s certainly an aspect of fascism
so they re out of tn congress they were fired by their opponent
that is accurate i grew up there too and i wish more people understood laws mean what the enforcer wants them to mean
oh they will win for sure no doubt in my mind this has secured their political career for years to come
basically yes their seats will ve empty until an interim representative can be placed and then a special election can be held mind you the counties that will be determining who holds those interim seats are both democrat and there s nothing stopping them from putting up the people who were kicked out so there s a chance this causes nothing but a brief vacation for them while they get to keep protesting
yeah except the can be reinstated by their local government and re elected in the next election
the gop has no shame young people get this the youth voting bloc will not put up with this shit
tennessee voters wake up vote these nazi banana republic party leaders out
iirc tennessee had a house member accused of sexual assault and they just kindly asked him not to run again it s not like he did anything truly bad like protesting school children getting blown away in class i don t know how voters can stand for this crap it s infuriating
probably that and how dare he challenge the right to blow a first grader out of their shoes
the tennessee gqp are straight up racist fascists
to be fair racism is only part of it conservatives embrace hatred of all forms not just on the basis of race it s not like they won t expel the white democrats from the state house too once they get there
it s going to be great when the courts put these two back into their rightfully elected positions i can see this going all the way to the supreme court and there is no way that conservatives can spin it differently as retaliation for exercising their first amendment rights
i hope he becomes president one day
this guy had me in tears it gave me hope this is what we need
get out and vote people
people thinking america has ever been an actual democracy are always funny because we have never been a democracy we are a constitutional republic pushing imperialistic values is at the heart of a republic it happened with both greece and rome even the way laws are passed are closer to a republic and not a democracy elected representatives control federal law and not the actual people like a democracy would the biggest difference between a republic and democracy is that while similar republics give more power to the elected reps than they do to the people
if you have a fro you must go this country is really making me nervous for the future my children are going to inherit welcome to america where we travel back in time
you can t lose the democracy to those it was designed for
patriarchy did they mean fascism or authoritarianism
god damn everyone s watching
republicans afraid of free speech
you would think not expelling a pedophile would be a low point what will do next year
wild that reps can just unelect an elected official
get out and vote and drag a couple friends along too
if they were capable of shame this problem wouldn t exist people keep expecting sociopaths to behave politely it s very silly
this is tennessee we are talking about they love their racist
tennessee republicans just expelled the two black guys and not the white lady i really don t know how they can claim it s anything but racist
they tried to expel of them today but one of them got to stay guess what was different about her
gif giphy 3o6mbisqwzah4lqesw downsized
you re afraid of your children s futures because of afros if you re racist just say that
i wish getting politically involved was more accessible most people i know just complain and vote once a year
when the gop hide as democrats and switch back to republican once voted in then voting doesn t seem like it s working either https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article273956915.html
get out and scream in their faces until they go home
they ll just gerrymande to stay in office
no i m saying his hair didn t match the dress code it s a dig at all these idiots who expect black people to avoid having their cultures hair styles i m scared because these idiots are asking what gun a kid wants to be shot with while kicking out someone who is standing up for those students
okay so no more kids sports in kansas no sane parent would allow their child to go through that just to play fucking t ball for the podunk wildcats
does anyone know where the un sits of a systemic violation of children also can t wait to see who volunteers to be the one checking the kids
why do you think the gop started calling everyone else groomers it s because if they re saying their opponents are something doing something it just means the gop is already it doing it projection is gop bread butter
they just made some pedophiles extremely happy
totally unrelated but did you know can build a guillotine for about
cock inspection day is back in kansas
how this doesn t run afowl of unreasonable search and seizure is mystifying to me
republicans appear to be very interested in children s genitals kind of like catholic priests maybe we should look into it
and republicans in florida are trying to compare this to the mmr vaccine what s the difference between kansas being invasive with your child and schools force vaccinating your child and giving them autism and changing their dna
next bill up for vote anyone including doctors who see a child s genitals for any reason other than a medical procedure are guilty of child abuse and child pornography which let s be honest should carry life as a penalty
while i stand firmly against any anti trans laws and this one is especially gross and vaguely worded it doesn t actually say anything about genital inspections this is why i don t watch cable news anymore they re all full of shit
just to reiterate their platform voted for forced conception for minors voted against female autonomy voted for no restrictions on assault rifles voted against free meals for children in school voted against expanded medical services for veterans voted to ban black history cultural history voted for child labor voted for lowering age of consent child brides voted against epa environmental regulations voted against bank regulations and now voting for sanctioned voyeurism of a minor this is no longer the gop this is a party of vile hatred they are thoroughly un american
somehow i don t see drag queens lining up to provide these inspections i wonder who will though
while it s a shame my state voted for this anti trans bill there is nothing in the bill about forced genitalia checks these tweets are just false which doesn t help the cause and only feeds the right theory of fake news
who do they think they are the catholic church
kansas also known as the pedophile state x200b edit ok so after looking at the bill itself i don t see anything about genital inspections it says athletic teams or sports designated for females women or girls shall not be open to students of the male sex it s about the same as saying that boys can t compete in girls events we ve never had genital inspections prior to this so unless there s more to this story i m going to assume that this is just manufactured outrage here
it s not next question
looking at little children s junk is now their right and no one will enfringe upon that right don t tread on me s they are despicable and i hope they burn in hell
paedophiles are gonna rush to become gym teachers now oh wait
so where s the both sides people at sure they can call out every democratic fuck up they want but there isn t a single doubt or second guess that the republican party voted for this right because i really really want to see their defense counter argument for this actually is other than whataboutism or bringing up something that happened in the past
charge anyone who actually does this job with sexual abuse of a minor charge the republicans who passed this abominations with promoting sexual abuse of minors
i m convinced every kansas republican is a pedophile who wants to touch children s genitals
i had to get a physical exam before freshman year of high school football it included the turn your head and cough part
this isn t what the law says republicans are liars and democrats leave out key portions of the truth
definitely not condoning the concept of genital inspection for minors but how does this differ from the turn your head and cough hernia check up that has been standard practice for decades or was that never inflicted on girls
next up will be the i had to fondle them to verify that they were authentic
i had a track coach that would have loved this new law
the cruelness is the point
mgt needs to see this
are parents going to comply with this are parents going to let some weirdo teacher check their kids genitals just saw that your kids can play baseball at school would it be better for the kids to just get together and form their own after school team with a parent as a coach fuck all this
this is pretty fn fucked up
party of pedopholes
damn bro i miss penis inspection day
anyone trys yo inspect my kid like that would have a very very very bad time of it
how to kill title ix in one easy step i m starting to get dangerously angry with these ignorant bigoted pervs
are the parents ok with this i would think even the most negligent parents would be like wtf this is beyond disgusting
and let the underaged pussy grabbing errr observing begin these are some sick fucks in the r party
easy it s not okay
can we just get the civil war over with might be a good time to do with a dem as president
first thing that came to mind braveheart king edward granting prima noctae rape rights to english nobles guaranteeing just the right people will apply for the job for the right wing this is a win win own the libs crush the other and give power to pedophiles swelling their ranks
trust me it s not ok just let me find out that an adult inspected my kid s genitals they will regret that decision promise
conservatives lgbtq is bad and they re all pedophiles and they indoctrinate our children also conservatives we want to look a looksey at children s genitals and we want to force every child to be a christian lgbtq hating racist bigot who forces others to be the same way
time to wall off kansas and napalm the whole state clean sometimes you need to take a mulligan
get out and vote people
don t let your child participate on youth sports for the enjoyment and profit of these perverts fuck the religious right and their outrageous agenda
it isn t okay it s just what s happening
pedos
this is what happens when christians get involved
otherwise known as legalized sexual assault of minors
somehow i m reminded of porky s
not all children just the girls telling girls starting at years old if there is something you want to do you need to be assaulted you have no choice
this turn of events can be explained by the fact that kansas best and brightest always leave and their worst and dimmest get sent to the state house
there will be a lawsuit against this monday at latest
how is this not sexual abuse
how did they override the governor s veto
oh you re forgetting maga republicans exist
exactly any parent who agrees to it should lose custody of their kids
am a parent and there is no way i would allow this its so dumb that we cant come up with a logical way to have sports thats inclusive for everyone without fucking completely ruining things theyve decided to ruin everything on the off chance that kids may have different parts insane
you re forgetting how many people have let their kids be altar boys for centuries
you see the thing is is it stops the trans athlete from playing it will be used to intimidate the right people these laws are never practiced uniformly only to hurt a specific group of people and not just lgbtq individuals but likely others that threaten rich families golden child s chance at a scholarship that student is performing to well they must be a trans let s force them to prove it and even if she isn t it will put her off from pursuing the sport
these same people defended the church when it was done before
no sane parent would allow their child to go through that bro these people are still putting their kids in private catholic children s weekend sleepover night at the creepy old priest s house they aren t going to bat an eye at coach staring at their junk in the name of football and politics
oh we didn t exactly ratify that one we re the only nation that didn t https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._ratification_of_the_convention_on_the_rights_of_the_child
i can provide sharpening services
the argument will be sports are optional you don t have to play if you don t want strangers fondling your kids don t take them to church send them to boy scouts let them wrestle for the ohio state university hang around republicans play sports in school
because it s during the physical which is already required for sports
so if i walk into the bathroom and see a kid with his pants around his ankles i now go to prison for life
this is no longer the gop this is a party of vile hatred it s always been this way they simply hid it better
but how do they go about determining a boy or girl just because it says you re a boy on your birth certificate doesn t mean you re a boy and how would you go about proving that
when it defines sex by genitalia and dna how do you think they re going to check sex dna tests are too expensive
because it s not medically necessary that should be obvious
this is kindergarten to college did you have to turn your head and cough when you were
i don t know what team you were on but we never had to do that it is certainly not standard for all sports despite what gym jordan might be telling you
definitely not condoning the concept of genital inspection for minors but
you know we should inspect everyone s genitals before they get on planes too because we already do it anyways s
i d really like to think there isn t a parent who would say yes please let this strange adult inspect my child s bits so i can spend hundreds of dollars for them to play volleyball especially when they apparently don t want those kids to be educated on what those parts of their body do but yeah probably just to own the libs and feel some kind solace knowing their afab daughter isn t playing against a trans girl because we all know trans teens in high school only do it to try and dominate sports s hopefully not necessary
i feel like the maga parents are going to get outraged and insulted when their kid is asked to show their genitals the conservatives probably think their families is above that because how could their conservative raised kids be trans they ll throw a fit saying can t you tell she isnt trans why are you asking to check the genitals of my clearly female daughter how dare you say she looks like a boy as if they re surprised that this bill impacts their kids too regardless of how red they vote
but aren t those people the people who think teachers are grooming their children into pedophilia at school so they re really gonna be ok with those people checking their children s genitals
it s not just maga republicans this was a unanimous vote it s all republicans every single last one
and the parents that want their kids on travelling teams who play sports in hopes of maybe going pro that is a small thing the parents are willing to give up not the kid of course
these fuckers are already putting their preteen daughters into beauty pageants why not a little nudity too maga mommy didn t raise no losers
that s the plan then send them to factory jobs in arkansas
or join the scouts i wanted to do scouting soooo bad as a kid but my parents vehemently put the kibosh on that desire for no apparent reason afterall how do explain to a kid that their hobby might get them diddled
opposition to ratification comes from some religious groups these along with many political conservatives claim that the convention conflicts with the united states constitution ironic right
i am practically useless but can offer workers snacks
there is a difference between seeing someone while passing in a bathroom and having them present for inspection admittedly i could have worded it better
while there were always super terrible politicians they were on the fringes until bush i signed a bill for gun free safe zones reagan voted against assault weapons bush ii signed numerous environmentally focused bills bolstering the clean air act john mccain voted in favor of common sense taxes and would never have voted against veteran health mitt romney was in favor of campaign finance reform the gop of the 80s 2010s had some semblance of balance check to progressive policies not the outright hatred of the people it has today
my point was that we re already doing this
yes
yes gym jordan was the head of every youth sports league i participated in it all makes sense now
followed by an honest question we just instinctively fight about everything now sports hernia checks have been standard practice for almost yrs
i have a sister who is full maga along her her husband and kids those poor kids have been hardcore brainwashed into the maga shit i found out how hardcore into trump they were back in when we went to their house for a family dinner they had recently moved to a newer nicer house and we re giving us the full tour we get to their teenage daughters room and it s covered with trump merch flags posters maga hats their teen daughter had turned their bedroom into a shrine worshipping an actual rapist we have basically gone no contact with said family members since then i am sure they are the kind of people that would proudly display some certificates showing how the local republican genital fondlers have proven that their daughter is not trans they would probably frame that shit
we can only hope otherwise there s going to be a lot of really creepy peeking going on
these are people who already send their children to places with rampant abuse and actively participate in covering up the abuse so this is not actually anything out of the norm
i think they re flying in an expert like matt gaetz
it took me like seconds to decide that my landlord who owns churches leads the local boyscouts and home schools his kids was a weirdo how these people are still sending their kids off with obvious weirdos is beyond me it s like their brains are wildly underperforming
bruh
you underestimate the importance of good nutrition
reagan voted against assault weapons because of the black panthers
the why is obviously important forcing a kiss on someone is a hell of a lot different than cpr
can t take him seriously since he looks like a wax figurine
have you maybe tried stop being massive pieces of shit first you don t have to but it helps
translation younger voters are too educated and see through our bullshit we need to make college even more expensive so only the rich can afford it and shut down the internet they can fact check us too easily
cons should we make an appeal to younger voters nah let s just make it harder for them to vote by closing polls near universities
the only thing he s right about is they will never win battleground states again moving forward
damn its almost like people are finally sick of their shit
i grew up republican in a conservative house hold voted for mccain and romney both my father and i sat out in we voted for president biden and have switched out party registration fuck out of here with this brain washing nonsense americans want liberty and freedom over shariah christian law
here s hoping scotty boy is right this one time
or maybe just stop sucking at your jobs
you mean years of active shooters at places you should be safe and the republicans just offering hopes and prayers instead of solutions
you just aren t the most popular girl in 7th grade scott get over it you fascist dumpling
it comes from years of radical indoctrination funny i say the same about religion and churches
republicans are disgusting
wait i thought the issue was younger people aren t getting out and voting
how s that foxconn thing working out
if your ideology is so weak it has to be sheltered then maybe you should rethink it
when you experience society it indoctrinates you sure pal
in a democracy that should be an indicator that your ideals are not keeping with the times
republicans can only win if there were no minorities or trans people that s why they re actively genociding them
ah yes the fucking fuck who lied his way into office
educated people are hard to deceive and manipulate
and scott walker remains both a total piece of crap and an idiot it s so good to see there s been no development there
indoctrinated by who a lot of these voters were in school during walker s reign they grew up under a republican government maybe they see the bullshit for what it is
i find it hilarious how fox news openly sources wsj like that so frequently as if it s not just another murdoch soap box
radical indoctrination is not wanting to die in school because our leadership is failing us how long will it take them to learn that lesson
radical indoctrination aka religion republicans have had no policy ideas for the past decade at least they re literally against everything that would help the average everyday american they re out of ideas all they have is suppressing votes gerrymandering maps and throwing out votes after elections that s it
scott walker is one of the original fascists of the republican party if he and others could they would force people them into indoctrination camps to become slaves of the republican authority thinking for yourself is detrimental to authoritarian rule
yeah the people who have to live with the long term consequences of these decisions are the issue okay
i remain awe struck that the gop despite the fact that their base is aging out of existence and seeing what happens to their candidates when the young get pissed off enough to vote would make thumbing their noses at pretty much everything the young value central to their platform walker thinks they can magically lure young folks into their fold while carrying on the way they do the gop is being propped up by gerrymandering voter suppression and the quirks of the senate sooner or later their sleaze will be stretched too thin to hold the tide back and they ll be done for
when did hitler s teeth become a look
i ll give you one guess why this ghoul is in charge of the young america s foundation and it has nothing to do with politics
younger voters are the solution
must get toothpaste back in tube will it work no it won t
i honestly have no clue what the gop is even going to do in years when the boomers die off originally john mccain was going to choose liberal joe liberman as his running mate i think that was the timeline that would ve had the republican party become more moderate with time and attempt to take votes from the swingiest of swing voters suburban white women that apparently poll best with moderate conservatives then the koch brothers stepped in and really pushed this governor of alaska and well this timeline we re in angrily gestures vaguely around happened
you cant undo the damage you ve done to us with your policies by trying to make us idiots now get fucked
more and more of those young voters are educated i d say they are making smart choices and they have made it known that they lean liberal for social issues the right can t seem to understand that
i have zero respect for the gop you run a fair election offer the best choice to the establishment and present solid logical arguments i support you you run a sensationalist campaign and promote hate i have no respect for anything you or your cronies say
they don t give a shit about democracy its all about limiting democrat s votes and gerrymandering
conservatives will never win battleground states again do you promise
it s the nature of time that the old ways must give in it s the nature of time that the new ways comes in sin the new generation is coming and these bastards dont like it try to demonize progress try to dehumanize difference things will change for the better eventually but the old guard will go out kicking and screaming to the end
because the last thing they want is the idiots to realize that the people telling them who to hate are the ones screwing them over controlling the stupid keeps everyone from being able to unite change the world
or maybe the generation of mass school shootings is done with the party that chooses guns over kids
news flash anything that is throughout culture is not radical it s normal what is radical is the right wing trying to move the country years into the past
the gop is alienating younger voters at lightning speed and i m here for it their shit has to stop and it looks like we can count on our post baby boom generations to make things right
this is why conservatives are targeting education and kids in their recent laws they desperately need to brainwash children into becoming intolerant uneducated bigots or conservatives may lose power forever
well he is correct there s a hell of a lot of indoctrination going on especially with all those trump jesus comparisons and second amendment lies told by extremists
by all means republicans keep trying to ban abortion nation wide flooding our schools with guns and holding bogus congressional hearings that waste everyone s time and taxpayer money see how well it works out for you i mean you guys have been doing a real bang up job so far
it was only a matter of time before gen z started voting
this millennial want the younger people to keep voting you re just what we need
in florida rep mark foley was forced to resign after it was revealed that he d sent sexually explicit messages and propositioned teenage congressional pages via email and text in former rep dennis hastert the longest ever serving republican speaker of the house pleaded guilty to making illegal hush money payments in order to cover up his history of sexually abusing high school wrestlers he had coached decades before nothing is more stunning than having serial child molester and speaker of the house in the same sentence the judge said at his sentencing during and after the presidential race among the dozens of women who accused former president donald trump of being a sexual predator were several contestants in the miss teen usa pageant who reported that he barged into their dressing room while girls as young as were changing trump allegedly told them don t worry ladies i ve seen it all before his campaign denied the accusation but cnn unearthed a howard stern interview where trump bragged about walking into backstage dressing rooms at the pageants he ran during the midterms alabama senate candidate roy moore was accused of preying on girls as young as and the new yorker reported that his habit of trying to pick up high schoolers was so notorious that it actually got him banned from a local mall also in rep jim jordan one of trump s fiercest allies and a co founder of the hardline conservative freedom caucus became embroiled in a scandal over his time as a wrestling coach at ohio state university where a team doctor named richard strauss who committed suicide in was found to have sexually abused more than male student athletes an investigation commissioned by the university found that strauss regularly used examinations as an excuse to grope and fondle the students sometimes to the point of ejaculation often ordered them to strip nude unnecessarily and in two cases attempted to perform oral sex numerous former wrestlers told reporters that jordan was personally aware of the abuse during the early 1990s but chose to turn a blind eye the congressman simply denied having any knowledge of it and suggested at least one of the accusers claiming otherwise was acting on a personal vendetta against him and finally rep matt gaetz of florida is currently the subject of a literal sex trafficking investigation which is looking into whether he had sex with an underage year old girl among other issues greene is close with gaetz who denies the allegations and has defended him
now that s a nomination for most punch able face
i have never wanted to spit a thick loogie into one of these mfs faces more than i do now
so he must be a conservative because he dropped out of college and was never fully indoctrinated old white men afraid to lose their power young people aren t the problem they re the future
i m not popular its someone else s fault
gif giphy v9gjxvlnssda4 downsized
or they could move more to the center and use ideas that appeal to more people naw gotta brainwash them
try getting better ideas
that s what conservatives haven t tried so far indoctrination
well republicons have already made it more difficult for minorities and urban inhabitants to vote so i guess now they ll be targeting young voters
fuck this guy republicans loathe voters who are educated
here s a question what have conservatives done for the younger generations
we re a bunch of out of touch troglodytes who the youth find repulsive but it s not our fault at all it s the trans anarchist drag brunch indoctrination from social media universities keep on digging imbeciles
this shitbag is pooping his pants
if it makes scott feel better my gran texted me for the first time in months to tell me to vote for protasiewicz
how is he going to counter young people voting birth more old people the clock is ticking because the only people left who are buying into their bullshit are the loud minority and the old fashioned elderly and the problem with the old fashioned elderly is that they re a quickly depleting resource once they re gone it s crazy corrupt assholes vs the rest of the us
the scary part is that changing their messaging isn t even an option which only leaves trying to change the rules or otherwise subverting democracy
indoctrination on campus in school on social media in culture why thats everywhere but the church and home with the creepy pastors and uncles
great way of winning over your voters tell them they re a problem
kiss your party s asses goodbye if you think that s the only demographics your party should worry about
they re never going to win anything again young people have had it with old men telling them what they can and can t do with their genitals in private with other consenting adults had it with the book bans had it with you fucking antivax geniuses and your brilliant conspiracy theories enjoy being the minority oh you don t like that could that be because you know minorities are treated badly here
he s right but what policies and platform will they create to attract more voters
hey gop here s an idea have you tried not being a bunch of collective dickheads to marginalized communities
nah bro you re the issue
they ll never realize that they are the problem
i like how it is always young people and never that people no longer get more conservative as they get older conservatives look back and thinks times were better and can completely ignore that things were better thanks to government policies they have fought against ever since what do i have to look back to iraq war market crash each year more and more data shows that conservative policies do not work and instead of any introspection they blame the people for not buying their bullshit
they re celebrating kid rock unloading a full clip into a case of woke beer and expelled two black men for protesting gun violence oh yeah it totally the kids
or hear me out perhaps republicans actually listen to what the population wants young and old instead of just doing what their rich donors want
the gop is so fucking out of touch with reality
never again god willing
you heard it americans exercising their right to vote is a problem for them
let s get them
have you tried not being absolute trash
that s the long way of saying we can t brainwash the youth vote so we re just going to attack them
gop question of the year let s see how many groups will we have to disenfranchise before
time to introduce a zero child policy for the far white
well who taught scott that he got his bald spot from repeatedly hitting his face against a wall because we should avoid them
under no circumstances should we consider changing our policies to gain their support it s the indoctrination yearight
well you see if the young people would stop voting or if they hadn t been indoctrinated by every aspect of society like school college work social media walking down the street just living and instead simply listened to their parents and fox news we wouldn t have this problem
or and stay with me here instead of countering it you actually listened to them and introduced policy based on the desires of your constituency maybe then they d vote for you

cheat he means cheat if elections were fair they already would have been losing for years and we wouldn t have battleground states
imagine backing a political ideology where the new generation voting is your enemy people freely voting is your enemy your ideology should fall deserves to fall
good
keep talking like that about young voters and you ll remain a former governor
younger voters are the solution
people who go to college are the issue people who have vaginas are the issue people of color are the issue people who read books are the issue teachers are the issue scientists are the issue librarians are the issue gays are the issue unions are the issue doctors and nurses are the issue journalists are the issue non corrupt judges are the issue non corrupt law enforcement is the issue people calling for peace are the issue the real jesus christ the one who took care of the sick and children is the issue immigrants are the issue democrats are the issue children who need school lunches are the issue old people who need care are the issue sick people who need insurance are the issue drag queens reading a book are the issue parents who don t want their kid to die from an ar15 are the issue people who don t want to be raped are the issue honest elections are the issue competent people are the issue and they are a fucking inconvenience dogs are the issue cats are the issue
ran into him randomly in milwaukee years ago short little fella with no chin god he s one ugly ass ventriloquist dummy lookin dude
you know who ll give us the best advice on how to win losers
maybe have good policies instead of just saying we need to end woke or whatever
or you know take positions that appeal to voters under the age of
i immediately hate anyone who describes sex as a woman opening her legs or allowing herself to get creampied
consent to sex consent to pregnancy it s a risk you take yes but all activity comes with risks eating gas station sushi does not mean i consent to food poisoning and no doctor will refuse to treat me for it because i behaved recklessly and no court could require me to carry my parasite to term because i should have kept my mouth closed going skiing does not mean i consent to broken bones but i will be treated for injuries if i miscalculate a turn even if i stupidly wore the wrong skis or didn t wear a helmet
and a hearty fuck you if you can t imagine being sexualized from the time you were a small child and of the men you ever met in your life were trying to fuck you if you cannot imagine the insane tortuous pressure from some fucken perv im gonna pop yer cherry aside from outright rape then really you re too fucken stupid to procreate anyway sit the fuck down
it s easy for incels to be high and mighty about something they will never experience
i love these guys the bible says life begins at conception fails to realize the bible defines the seed as being the sole determining factor in conception therefore everytime a man masturbates they are aborting a child also whenever a man s body eats an unused sperm they are also aborting an unborn child it s almost as if the bible was written during a time when we didn t understand how reproduction worked
keep your legs shut keep it in your pants and out of hers prick
what about the man s role in this it takes two to tango as the saying goes doesn t the dude have some responsibility in this
brian shannon seems like a creepy guy the line about women opening their legs tells me all i need to know
incels like brian who probably has never seen a naked woman in person should keep quiet about these things and just attend maga rallies with the other cult members
brian s inability to conceive heh heh of a way to impregnate a woman whose legs are closed betrays an utter lack of experience and imagination
bold to assume guy is getting laid
brian lives alone
since there s the abortion ban how long do you think it ll take before they get rid of child support since assholes like them are fine with punishing a woman via having to keep a baby even if the woman is a god damn child or the child will kill them but their tune will change the second the man has to pay child support for them not keeping their dick in their pants
i know we want to call guys like this incels but there are many who think like this with serious girlfriends fiances and wives and horrifyingly daughters i suspect many of their female counterparts either don t know they talk like this on the internet or are too ignorant to realize how it hurts them as well i see guys like this on instagram a lot i ll go check out their profile and often they have their spouse or so s name or handle in their bio tagged pics i always wonder if those women really know who they re dealing with who they share a bed with at night and make more humans with
people like that guy only bust nuts in their hands
legally speaking technically the answer is yes to the question posed regarding consent to child support when a party presumably male busts their nut at least here in california it is source am a family law attorney
he s never been near a woman has he
i ve never had problems with that tube sock dude gif giphy l0hlhqzyxi6kfexf6 downsized
no sperm no baby men need to be held accountable for unwanted pregnancies
i mean yeah if you nut in a woman you re responsible for any possible pregnancy that s just how it is every real man knows this raise the kid or pay up
pretty sure brian only busts nuts on his sheets alone thinking about how much he hates women cuz they recognize his misogyny self hate and ignorance
she s talking to someone who has only done it in a sock or body pillow
men are forced to consent to years of child support if they have unprotected sex that is how our laws are currently written and enforced chuchu makes a good point it s just not the point she thinks she s making edit i m very pro choice but we have to be consistent about our positions
i do and as such i have socks that are over now
her karma ran over his dogma
into tissue paper
yes
so you want me in complete control of my body up until pregnancy and after that the state dictates my options fuck that
abortion reductio ad absurdem the tragedy of the commons is located within the female uterus
don t know how many times it has to be said consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy
yep if you bust a nut you know the consequences you have no say in what she ll do next theirs a chance of their being a child you should pay child support the only thing that should get you out of this responsibility is revoking all your parental rights
my grandmother is brain damaged and has the mental capacity of a year old child as a young woman in she was rapped and imprgegnated by a man with a family wife kids and a previous arrest record for you guessed it rapeing another disabled person befor my grandmother they made her have the baby she did not consent she was at her cope program back then the organization cope used to help mentally impaired people find ways to be active through community service she was getting back from her little job and then was rapped by a serial rapist basically the way this person stated it is very ignorant because they re far from knowing a rape survivor its not their reality so its fine to pass judgement and blame the victim when they act like being raped victimized them because god forbid any of these republicans and their ignorant band of followers take a minute to self reflect and see things like rape and abortion aren t just black and white their can be many different case scenarios and exceptions but why should they care they don t know or probably care to get to know someone else s problems and situations
because for them sex is done to women not with them it s something to obtain from women not participate in with them so if women give it freely they hoes if not they gatekeepers of sex from poor incels and if against their will should ve had a husband to protect you silly billy also why they don t care about female pleasure customers don t care if the waiters have enjoyed their evening
i had an internet argument with a guy who was criticizing women for wanting abortions after spreading their legs i asked him if his wife spread her legs for him but was medically endangered by a pregnancy would he want her to have an abortion and live or watch her suffer and possibly die or would it be better if she stopped spreading her legs for him he got so offended that i would be speaking about his wife in those terms clearly only sluts and loose women find themselves unexpectedly pregnant
that s somewhat specific about skiing gif emote free_emotes_pack feels_good_man
also isn t it wonderful that we have ways to mitigate the risks condoms other contraceptives and to basically eliminate the consequences abortion morning after pills i think it s great it allows people of both sexes to enjoy sex relatively freely like you said we do plenty of leisurely activitie3s that carry risks seems like the only one they have an issue with is sex wonder why
i enjoyed your approach to this well done
i mean that s a a pretty poor understanding of consent consent means consenting to the risk so yeah it s not saying you re planning on it but if you consent to skiing you consent to risk of breaking a leg ie you understand the risk and decide the benefit is worth it same thing with medical procedures to obtain an informed consent means you explain the risks and the patient agrees they are acceptable doesn t mean that they want it to happen but they accept that it is possible and they want to proceed anyways
the only things i wanna be high and mighty about are owning a home and making a livable wage maybe i should wish for something more realistic like magic or dragons though
not in their world
not to them no pregnancy is entirely the woman s problem but but but they also want to take away all the woman s options for dealing with unintended pregnancy it s almost like they just want women to suffer no matter what
yes that s why they enforce child support
having a serious girlfriend fianc wife or daughter does not prevent someone from being an incel i mean every incel has a mother right
we really should think about the man more when we talk about abortion x200b fucking way obvious s
should add if married you can t be raped
so if women give it freely they hoes if not they gatekeepers of sex from poor incels and if against their will should ve had a husband to protect you silly billy so it s just if you re a woman it s pretty much a fuck you it s always your fault and nothing will ever please those assholes
because for them sex is done to women not with them wonderully said i start in the future by asking that not that i have many people in my life not already agreeing on this issue anyhow
if she readily accepts sexual advances she s a slut if she doesn t immediately give into sexual advances she s a bitch there s an unflattering sexist term no matter how you comport yourself
loophole sex with men as a man
it s almost like these guys never spend any time reflecting on these beliefs they re sure must be true because they don t hold up to the slightest bit of pushback
or heaven forbid they have a daughter who is assaulted amazing how holier then thou this incels are
writer skis or has skied they went deep on a volunteer pleasure activity that the person makes constant choices consent no one is refused help at the patrol medic
yeah i feel u wienerwrld had a serious ski accident in which they stupidly wore the wrong skis and didn t wear a helmet
because it s not actually about sex it s about controlling women
absolutely i consent to the risk i accept the risk and i can get medical treatment for the unintended consequences of my choices when i strap on my skis i accept the risk of injury but no doctor would refuse to treat my injuries because i accepted the risk nobody insists well what did you expect that s what happens you shouldn t have done that knowing it could result in a broken leg should have just kept your shoes on instead of wantonly sliding down the mountain on skis you re just going to have to limp now when i have sex i consent presumably to the sex and accept the risk of my activity and if even while taking the proper precautions i end up with an unintended pregnancy i should be able to get treatment to end it if that s what i choose i also accept the risk of an std and am entitled to medical treatment if i end up with one but i don t consent to the std
i m and i finally did it i qualified for two first time homebuyer grants then i finally got a decent jorb i ve been struggling my entire life waiting for the other shoe to drop
i mean considering that it s an abbreviation of involuntary celebate it kinda does you can t really be an incel and be in a sexual relationship with someone or have a kid my point is that these guys aren t all hopeless nerds sitting in their mom s basement dusting dorito crumbs off their man boobs while trolling all day there are a lot of guys slinging that stuff around that look like normal well adjusted people with sos families good jobs friends there s just a lot of very hateful very unfair perspectives of women floating around these days and a lot of it is coming from people some might not suspect
chuchu seems to think it s a relevant comparison she s just being inconsistent in her reasoning unless she thinks men shouldn t be forced into child support which i would situationally agree with that would be a consistent response to the dumb comment she s replying to
this one annoys me to no end as a young child middle school aged i overheard my mom and her then husband not my dad in any sense of the word having an argument where she screamed the he had raped her my mom never knew i overheard and i was much too small physically to do anything about it but then in high school i started to bulk up they got into an argument in the kitchen with me present he hit me and i fucked his shit up gave him the payback he so justly deserved for not only the rape years prior but all the hell and torment he put me through and my mom through shortly after that they divorced and now he s dead from brain cancer the world is better off without steve
nailed it women have been to blame since handing adam that apple
people who say shit like this usually don t have daughters if they have a daughter and she is raped they quietly get her a abortion
lol i haven t skied since i was i m now but i did sprain my knee that one time my point is that every enjoyable activity comes with risks but you are not required to live with unintended consequences of risky behavior other than this
fair i guess i misread consent to pregnancy as consent to risk of becoming pregnant but yeah the risk is an inherent part of consent is all i was saying
i agree with you and i feel like incel has become bigger than its involuntary celibate roots though i feel like incel has come to embody women hate and entitlement around women s bodies everywhere but even if we go back to the root term don t most men feel like they want more sex would they take it if there were no consequences doesn t that qualify them as involuntary celibate jeez i must be having a dark day dark thoughts let s talk about our favorite ice cream flavor instead
what if i told you that there are several situations in which a man may ejaculate that would not possibly result in a pregnancy
i d also like to say fuck steve i m sorry you went through that homie
fuck steve good on you for beating the shit out of him i hope you and your mother live long happy lives and that you both can recover from his abuse
i do not typically approve of domestic violence or vigilantism it s not a productive effective way of resolving anything typically i can see and enjoy the _hell_ out of the irony here way to go
i ve seen what brain cancer does to a person a fitting end to such a piece of shit i hope you are doing alright
fuck you steve i hope your death was painful and lonely
unfortunately my steve went to prison where they found and treated his cancer now he continues to be a cancer on society good job standing up and taking care of business
fuck steve it takes courage standing up for yourself and loved ones i hope you and your mom have a strong bond
let s not forget that red headed psycho lilith she was created from the earth she was equal we don t hear about her much anymore
i absolutely agree with you i broke my collarbone skateboarding like six months ago had to get surgery the whole nine yards obviously i wouldn t have broken it if i hadn t been skating but of course even though it was my fault i still got my healthcare covered by the government thank you canada
i mean my second sentence was it s a risk you take yes
let s talk about our favorite ice cream flavor instead okay so ben and jerry s came out with these topped flavors and the ice cream itself is amazing but they re topped with fucking chocolate ganache absolutely fuckin bangin the tiramisu one is really good but i prefer the one with little caramel cups in it jfc
are we talking about masturbation or sex which is potentially reproductive i m pretty sure we re talking about the latter consent to sex isn t consent to parenthood i agree with this idea but chuchu s attempt to illustrate this with men fails because for men consent to sex really is treated as consent to years of child support
thanks it was definitely a bit cathartic giving him his just deserts i ve no regrets doing it would recommend for anyone else going through similar situations
thanks i think i ve definitely recovered my mom re married to a decent enough guy but she did pass in after she got covid from my sister and her diseased spawn
it turns out that my hard no to domestic violence and vigilantism has an enormous unless you are a kid who has grown up and now has the physical strength to kick the shit out of your abuser clause who knew
i think adam and eve were equal in god s eyes king queen stewards and priests i think the patriarchy sees eve as a convenient scapegoat but god didn t that s my understanding anyway and that whole thing about increased pain of childbirth it s a mistranslation it should be emotional pain of relationships heartbreak another move by the patriarchy i don t know much about lilith so i can t speak to that
i m a chocolate and caramel person myself i like the karamel sutra that has the caramel core too chocolate fudge brownie with the brownie pieces chocolate ganache is actually pretty easy to make if you like it so much it makes great ice cream topping but also frosting you just melt chocolate chips and add heavy cream super easy and tastes amazing you could dip your whole life in chocolate ganache if you so desired see isn t this better
what if i told you that there are steps that a man could take to drastically reduce the chances of impregnating a woman during sex
i ll admit i ve always semi regretted not doing similar violence to my mom s second ex unfortunately i was a short and small kid dude literally weighed times my weight all he had to do was sit on me to smother me
unvaccinated kids i m guessing
there are a lot of verses in the bible that point to women being lesser than it was written by men after all
i like the one that is half chocolate brownie and half cookie dough ice cream i also like the netflix and chill d and the tonight dough ice creams but i don t often see them
yep out of everyone in my immediate family i m the only one who got vaccinated i was nc with my sister and her spawn years before covid didn t even go to my moms funeral because she d be there
yep men living in a patriarchy much like we do today
i am sorry i lost my mom in it was a brutal loss
speaking of delegitimizing the gop has de legitimized itself as a political party by aggressively passing absolutely insane laws on non issue items and doing complete jack shit on real problems
fuck my life can we stop trying to be three 1930s germany s in a trench coat and persecuting minority groups by demonizing them this is literally what these absolute fuckers are doing
whaaaaat a tiny minority of trans people do fucking terrible things just like in the population in general
cool are we looking at gender identity as it relates to mass shooting because cis herero males are about a billion times more likely than anyone to commit mass shooting definitely should do something about that
meanwhile woman in florida found with pipe bombs and a hit list gets no jail time gets mental health help instead
of note my post is in no way defending this individual
but you don t understand all the straight white white male school shooters had mental issues totally different
look man if you cared about terrorism power stations wouldn t be getting shot up
nazigop should trend every day
modern kristallnacht seems not so far away sadly
all those straights are what
huh it s as if targeting a group of people with systemic persecution and calls for violence against causes some of that group to turn to violence themselves of course they know that
so if a straight white male does something similar would that be a straight white male terror update s
it s almost like if you launch a genocide against a group of people and you go to your national fascist convention where you vow to eradicate them some of them are going to react very poorly to that funny that i am not endorsing a mass shooting but colorado springs is the city where a christo fascist terrorist went into one of the only safe spaces lgbtq people have in the area and just started executing them all how long ago was that months a year
so now it s trans terrorism these people will stop at nothing to generate hate
nazis did the same thing with jews roma people homosexuals and other minorities republicans are nazis
get out and vote
fuck what conservatives are doing to trans people all over the country but let s not be stupid enough to pretend this person isn t a terrorist a manifesto and bomb making materials throw her ass in jail for life fuck that don t use every political foothold possible to give credence to a literal terror suspect just because they happen to be trans that s disgusting
but if we go after straight white males it s all of a sudden an unfair generalization insane world
the word is dehumanize
these are the same people that will beat a dog and then act shocked when the dog bites them
maybe we can brand conservatives as domestic terrorists so we can delegitimize them
hey let them say that we need to gun control for mentally ill people lol
combat the crazy trans narrative with the religious zealot narrative the red caps will cower away
if a few trans people committing mass shootings in is terrorism then i d love to know wtf they call years of mass shootings committed by predominantly white males the price of freedom
man 1930s germany was not where i wanted to live in my 20s
take that same energy and go after the catholic church clergy that has been raping boys for centuries and continue to do so
soi white people can be terrorists but only if they re trans got it s
is this the same asshat who was claiming that conservatives successfully cancelled netflix and the nfl
projection
nazi propaganda
reading someone not only using the words trans terror update unironically but also using them as a widespread manipulation and brainwashing tactic i ve gotten to the point that i m feeling mentally sickened this this much evil honestly and legitimately exists in this world already has this much power and is widely accepted
has this tool posted about any of the right wing white supremacists shooting up various places
well if they re gonna accuse me of it anyways might as well
lol found duck tape and gas must be explosive
alright so do the same with all the straight white dudes that did the same and keep publicizing it
i love how they re suddenly all about making sure everyone knows their preferred pronouns
this is actually the first trans shooter i ve ever heard about
of mass shooters are middle aged white men
the most amazing thing about this is that cops actually prevented a shooting for once i bet if it was a cis kid they would have let them go with a warning
how are two maybe trans people who are involved in school shootings more dangerous than the overwhelming majority of cis mostly white men who are known to commit or plan to commit these school shootings why are we not focusing on those people i know the answer of course
so the tens of thousands of other school shooters don t count murdered children don t matter unless the killer is trans very convenient very original s if not clear
one unexpected aspect about the increasingly number of people identifying as trans is the growing number of women that are mass shooters
the other school shooters were white males get fhckd
you guys are the reason they can get ahold of the firepower in the first place and you slander them and talk shit on them constantly i wonder why
the gop continually bullying this group isn t helping and trying to take rights away left and right such bullshit go get them gen z
big woop one of the leaders of the insurrectionists ers is trans
if the shoe fits
quite the echo chamber turds have here lol
so another trans person planning on shooting up a school is fine with you guys there s severe mental health problems in this country this goes to show it
terrorist is a pretty big stretch but there does seem to be a pattern starting here i m mostly just grateful for this kid s parents for speaking up they re the people we should be plastering the news with
now uhh hate to tell you this but
killed kids death penalty
edit commented wrong place oops
they found out of thousands is
dehumanize
gun reform just do the gun reform let s work out that it s not the persons it s the guns can they see that now
i don t agree with dehumanizing trans people this is wrong let them be themselves and free to be how they want to be aside from that i don t condone violence and this person killed innocent people over nothing they could have easily ran away from home and lived their lives how they wanted to away from their super religious parents violence is never the answer
what ever happened to what godless video games and music made them do this s anything but a fucking mirror eh business as usual for morons guess the response should be massive parades of all the previous religious zealots in the stacks of shooters carrying out their forsaken moral codes flood these responses with replys showing the majority of these mass shootings over however many years has been from all other walks of life the biggest problem is these one off screen grabs of ridiculous positions being shown around as if they have merit work on shutting them down rather than complaining on whatever sub will get these people more views
i started noticing on social media that conservative people i know are now gladly using the preferred pronoun of the nashville shooter people who ordinarily would refuse to do so not sure what that is about exactly
when you take up arms and go to extremes to make a point then yeah you re a terrorist if you disagree you re simply wrong about an objective fact
i know several parents with kids in the school she was targeting i m not happy about them making this a trans thing but i am happy she didn t get to do it
if you are going to walk into a school and kill kids you are using terror to further your point i don t care if you are fascist and doing up columbine or a trans wtf is the left running to make every possible excuse when it is such utter bullshit the minute you use any defense for this human trash you had to first climb a hill of defending a murderer of children just remember that before you start up that hill snowflake first step in the path is softening a child murderer for your own political aim makes you just as much trash as the right good job you both suck
you can t argue with the gop because its driven by irrationality approach as if they ve been drinking and are getting emotional
suddenly they care about school shootings
i mean liberals pushed really hard on these terrorists are alt right nazi etc so i m not surprised when we find out omg liberals can be assholes too that the conservatives make the same play
to repeat people working full time jobs need government assistance year olds shoot their teachers and politicians are worried about stage shows this is my reality
no matter what committing mass violence and planning these acts is absolutely abhorrent school shooters don t do it because they are healthy people who live healthy social lives they do it because they are abused traumatized or otherwise in a mental crisis these situations show once again our lack of access to proper psychological and social care i hope we learn from these events and implement solutions to them
i hate dc draino he just spits out fake news conspiracy theories and polarizing nonsense such a fucking grift
they know they re losing too much ground especially with them losing wisconsin so they re going nuclear it s not going to work for them
in order to get them killed you mean
so the whole get armed for the trans day of vengeance thing didn t mean to do the things they were planning to do
ok while i do say that your point is valid she did posses bomb making materials and a manifesto on her possession so it s not far to say it is a potential terrorist plot now obviously taking this too far which seems to be what may occur more and more is wrong but to say terrorist i m this case isn t too far
he is a terrorist though
have they really delegitimized themselves as long as their party faithful continue to support them they stopped trying to win over people who disagree with them awhile ago they would much rather just stop people who do not agree from being able to vote at all
they re dehumanizing trans people and doing everything they can to paint them as dangerous and that s genocide step one or two
make sure you pay attention to what the other hand is doing lots of time this stuff to make you get irate is to distract you from what they re really doing
so they re terrorists is what you re saying
the term you are looking for is fascism
conservatives will tell you unless you re loading up trans people into boxcars in the genuide region of france it s not genocide it s just sparkling ethnic cleansing
i am just wondering why we aren t addressing all the cis white male terrorists who were responsible for the last mass shootings in the usa
actually as a white male i feel like i should point out that shooters are not a particularly diverse group a massive percentage of them are white males i notice that the gop chose not to mention that lily grew up as a white male
don t forget the maga guy who mailed all those dud pipebombs directly to dems and journalists was fake because the bombs didn t work https://youtu.be/mdtfyj1azgg
given how horribly they re treated by society i d say they re incredibly restrained
pretty much
it doesn t fit their bs narrative that trans people are mentally ill plus i can imagine republicans get together for a little fiesta every time a cis white boy goes out and kills minority children
not just cis hetero males cis hetero white males are the demographic that takes up the lion s share of mass shootings by their own logic we need to strip legal rights from modern history s most privileged subgroup
interesting typo while discussing genocide
thank you i was going to say i don t care their gender identity anyone who tries to shoot up a school of innocents can get straight fucked and is absolutely a terrorist there s a difference though the right has started glorifying their own shooters and our side such bullshit we even have to say that now legitimately wants them punished as they should be as terrorists anyone doing this is a straight up terrorist and it s sad as hell we re going through this in our country
they claim mental health issue when thousands of white straight men do it to deflect blame off of the real reason why they kill but when a single person of the group they like to claim all have mental health issues does the same exact thing suddenly not a mental health issue and is a pattern seriously can they stick to a rhetoric
here we have another white male with mental issues i m glad they caught him in time
well they genuinely think or at least say that trans gender people are insane so
could you help me out with who the fuck is shooting at power plants
yeah we re almost guaranteed to see a mass shooting at a pride event this year
indeed i m relatively safe in co but i m still frightened of the growing potential for the usonian kristallnacht for those unfamiliar from wikipedia kristallnacht or the night of broken glass also called the november pogrom was a pogrom against jews carried out by the nazi party s sturmabteilung sa paramilitary and schutzstaffel ss paramilitary forces along with some participation from the hitler youth and german civilians throughout nazi germany on november the german authorities looked on without intervening the name kristallnacht literally crystal night comes from the shards of broken glass that littered the streets after the windows of jewish owned stores buildings and synagogues were smashed the pretext for the attacks was the assassination of the german diplomat ernst vom rath by herschel grynszpan a year old german born polish jew living in paris
i don t think that s the case for this person from the information we ve gotten i wouldn t be surprised if this person actually wins the insanity defense
club q was last november so not even six months ago
how do you know she s a terrorist because the cops in fucking colorado springs said so what was the content of the manifesto what bomb making materials a pressure cooker and hand tools potassium nitrate a car battery and a cotton t shirt or five kilos of rdx and blasting caps you can make bombs out of any of those combinations but i d oppose arresting any farmer who uses potassium nitrate fertilizer
this is not the time to discuss politics unless the shooter is a trans person also their language white male shooter mentally ill trans shooter terrorist
mark my words the fascists will eventually try to pass bills to classify trans people as mentall ill to restrict access to firearms so trans people cannot defend themselves against personal or governmental persecution
right because two people get to make the official decision for everyone else lol
who threw the first brick at stonewall again i forget seems relevant for some reason
so do they think they will be safe if the far right get their way on the trans community
florida log cabin republicans reply i work with one of their vice chairs he constantly whines minorities are trying to take over the gay community and we don t need special rights when you have money you can afford to buy your rights that last statement he said the quiet part out loud a guy who is openly racist to poc gay guys will openly say ewww i don t do dark meat or ewww n dick i know what lesbian log cabin republican she said i would rather lose all my rights then have radical islam communists and socialists groomers and drag queens take over florida
that s some bullshit is this how straights who stand by the community should act seems a bit short sighted to oust a minority group of people when you re a minority yourself and need the same protections really dumb
a racist transphobic lesbian is a hell of a thing to choose to be good luck with that
well its not a mutual divorce we the larger lgbtq community isnt agreeing to exclude trans people from our coalition so transphobes can stop with that
fascists love infighting amongst their enemies
well surely the republicans will stop once the transfolk are eliminated right right s
ah yes the classic pull the ladder up behind you moves
this is some republican conservative extremist who s posing as an advocate for these causes
as a middle aged white gay man i have seen and heard some truly horrible things in my day many shockingly from other gay people i didn t tolerate it years ago and i refuse to tolerate it now any queer person who refuses to accept and honor all members of our community is not only hateful and hypocritical but also incredibly stupid if you think your otherness is more palatable to society and that the vast majority of racists and transphobes don t want all queer people dead or incarcerated then you really are naive
sadly there have been lgb people who are transphobic for many years that try to separate from the t as if we re not all in this together and the right hates all of us equally they seem to think by siding with the enemy on targeting trans people that they will themselves not become targets later when history shows us that is not remotely the case once trans people are dealt with the right will go after the rest of the acronym this also completely ignores the history of the lgbtqia community at least here in the united states trans women of color and drag queens were important parts of the community both before and after stonewall riots and during the riots riots that started the whole lgbt rights movement in this country marsha p johnson and sylvia rivera were integral parts of the community back then they were trans and gay rights advocates in a time when being such a thing could land someone in prison they and the organizations they founded gay liberation front and star street transvestite action revolutionaries transgender not being a term then fought for the rights of all non cishet people they provided support to people who were made homeless lost their jobs etc because they were gay or trans or whatever while there are doubts as to who actually threw the first literal brick in the riots marsha is often credited but there s doubt she was even there when the riots started and showed up a little later there is no doubt that trans people threw the first figurative bricks that trans people played important roles in the riots in the events leading up to them people like the ones in this tweet need a history lesson need to remember that the first pride was a riot a riot against police where trans people played important roles way to many cis gays and lesbians have forgotten or don t even know that pride isn t supposed to just be a huge flamboyant party it s supposed to be a reminder of the stonewall riots that paved the way to all of the lgbtqia rights we have today a reminder that the police are not our friends or our allies they are an enemy of our community unity is what got us to where we are today and is what will take us into a future without bigotry without racism without homophobia without transphobia without hatred towards non cishet people and that division such as this will only hurt us impede us on the path to that future pick me gays and lesbians don t realize that siding with the bigots against trans people will not protect them similarly to how the jews who sided with the nazis weren t protected for long once their usefulness to the nazis was through the thanks they got was getting thrown into the concentration camps themselves we re all in this together be we lesbian gay bisexual transgender intersex asexual pansexual etc or are allies together we can defeat hatred but divided we cannot as president abraham lincoln said a house divided cannot stand the house is the entire lgbtqia community everyone that isn t cisgender heterosexual and heteroromantic together we can stand strong divided we fall
when gay white supremacists draw the line
literally no one is stopping y all from waving flags that only have the rainbow part on it calm down
welcome to the beginners course of how do i be the last in line for the gas chambers
white lesbians opt in on the privledge of their relative proximity to cis gender white supremacy
i ve said it time and time again i will get downvoted for it but the truth is the truth there s not as much intergroup unity as many make it out to be many gay men very much so feel as if lbtqia essentially rides the coattails of gay men and don t put in the same work i m not saying i feel this way i m just saying as a statement of fact that it s not all peace love and happiness there s a lot of disagreement inside the lgbtqia community
i ve got mine fuck you the picture
i am a cis gay man and will happily stand with my trans brothers and sisters
as a bi male i m surprised they didn t pick a colour representing the b and cut that off too
fuck these cunts are you fucking serious you think the fasch trash are gonna just leave you alone once they are done with trans people this some boomer queer bullshit
apparently they don t know that black transwomen kicked off the stonewall protests
good luck hammering that one through at the next committee meeting trans people need our help more than anyone
not sure how you can be gay and be republican they don t want you either lol
transphobic lgb s deserve what republicans want for them
tbh i don t consider anyone who s just lgb and throws others under the bus to be part of the community just bastardized group who sold their souls to the enemy to fit in and probably money fuck em
i haven t seen a single bisexual person agree with anything like this because if this happens we know who s next
transphobic gays and lesbians there are dozens of us dozens
do they realize that they re the next target
fuck that shit i refuse to humor lgb transphobes any more than i d humor straight ones
the plan is they need to separate the lgbtq community from trans and pocs and other civil rights because that would be the majority of the country you separate marginal groups and destroy them slowly you can eventually destroy civil rights
it is an attempt to sell out others in hopes you won t be put against the wall it has never worked
marky s bio founder of lgbtrump ny chapter leader for gays against groomers x200b what a fucking quisling moron
sorry why is this being called racist not coming from a place of hate i could be ignorant of something here and would like to be informed
i ve been seeing a lot of fake twitter accounts lately pretending to be progressive gays against trans folk
the nazi salute is a nice touch hope they get hit by a bus
how is this racist i m legitimately not following that part
can someone who has twitter bully these people for me thanks and appreciate it
the fascist try divide and conquer
buddy the right will not embrace you because you want to drop the tq they ll still come after you in the end
as a cis straight myself let me tell ya folks the people against the tq s will not even think twice about cutting all the lgb s out hell they just got uganda to make it illegal you will not have anyone in your lgb pride parades when you try your hardest to screw qt people wanna know why because at the core of this movement is the fact that people we love suffer and just as lgb people suffered qt people suffer to and eliminating that is what matters when you do that to one group you re no different these people are the worst of the worst
it sad since they seem to forget that it was a black trans woman that started the lgbtq movement during the stonewall riots in the first place
important reminder that these lg people make up a minority of the supposed without the t groups they are pathetic but have no real place in the lgbt community
smells like the german jewish nazi party arm all over again
white women are notorious for not giving a shit about anyone but themselves politically
nope not falling for this divisive bullshit i can see the propaganda from a mile away it s designed to weaken the lgbtq community don t fall for it
is she dropping the flag and it s falling
who the fuck is matt and since when the fuck do they speak for everyone
welp they cut the ace flag too no garlic bread for you
i don t know who these people are but they absolutely do not speak for all of us this is exactly what the bigots want and we need to stay united
way to give up solidarity as soon as it gets a little hard
is asexuality a gender now
if you still think i can t help other people if it doesn t help me too then you re still broken seek therapy to understand your internalized damage flying spaghetti monster bless
this reminds of how trying to change the system by becoming a part of the system eventually leads to the system changing you
it is now official this person has become just like the bigots they ve had to fight against
my maga mother in law and her partner have shown that some gay people suck just like everyone else
same as republican white women putting all their eggs in the proximity to power basket it won t work
it truly makes me laugh to think about how pathetic they are cutting up a piece of cloth and saying shit like this while me and my trans gf are just chilling at home together loving life and each other
i would rather support the tq part because i don t like people who abandon others also if any gay lesbian people are morons if they think they aren t next
damn the gays are trying to start war with the kind of gays
i really don t get why we need so many flags to begin with i saw this coming a mile away when they make a new flag every summer pride is a very broad concept it works for everyone
i love when people pretend their unpopular opinion regarding an entire sector of the population has suddenly been applied as a formal decison on twitter it usually starts with the majority of americans
is this the person was arrested twice for vandalizing blm murals
typical white people behavior is what it is during the woman s suffragette white women worked with black people to get their right to vote once white women got it they stopped giving any fucks about their black allies same shit happened way back in the day white indentured servants sometimes slaves would riot with black slaves to stop this rich white people gave poor white people some power in the form of slave patrols poor whites got some power and maybe a bit of land and instantly betrayed their black brothers in arms you can expect the same shit within the lgbtq community itself the entire thing but also the smaller inter communities within itself once a group of white people have been accepted by the majority of whites they will quickly abandon their allies whether they are fellow whites or black or any other ally as a white person we have a very long history of rallying large groups of diverse people for rights and the moment we get the rights for ourselves we abandon everyone else
excluding trans people won t make the nazis love you
these them bitches rowling hangs with
the transphobic part is obvious but what s racist i don t think that is a nazi salute
tribalism divide divide divide
explain how it s racist
you don t speak for all lgbtq you better back the fuck up and learn your people s history little boy shameful little privileged a h le i am a gay man and i stand with anyone being oppressed
i m more impressed they left the b in usually these types want to exclude anyone not homosexual
they re trying to start a civil war stay strong men women and other genders we must stay strong against the people who want to take away your rights
a very not friendly reminder to transphobes that all arguments against trans folk have been used against everything from black people lgb people native americans jews and every other minority in america guess what every single time they were wrong they re gonna be wrong this time they always are
fucking terfs
yeah well i m bi and disagree so fuck terfs
there s a lesson here about the powerless becoming like the powerful
which means intersex non binary asexual aromantic pansexual polysexual omnisexual demigirl demiboy quoisexual questioning people are all cut out as well figures knew something was up when pinterest s favorite terf started ranting about how asexual people are invading lgb spaces and must be stopped so any bets on when they start attacking bisexual people too
imagine thinking the current fascists will stop at just stripping rights from the tq communities and not immediately come for the lgbs next anyone in a vulnerable minority community that s not sticking up for every vulnerable minority community is a fucking idiot
i honestly think stuff like this is part of conservative funded astroturf campaign to try to weaken our coalition
literal pick me girls
i had no idea that there was such a thing as the lgb community until i got into an argument with someone a few months ago ignorance is indeed bliss surprisingly common how openly hostile many people are of the people going through nearly the exact same persecution they went through while they re still going through it the problem is truly one of perspective and understanding until we can erode the misinformation surrounding different peoples and their beliefs or desires we will continue to have hate coming from should be allies because they just don t have perspective and someone s been lying to them
i m not gonna let terfs decide that trans people are no longer worth protecting no one should ever listen to terfs they re enablers of the next holocaust and i wish i was speaking in hyperbole
how is this racist i get transphobic but racist
oppressed oppressors it s everybody wants to be everything but only when it s convenient for them
gross i knew a queer like him irl he s still a pathetic piece of shit too
do people not even understand the fundamentals of lgbtq the acronym group is meant to be all inclusive its supposed to be about unity and love regardless of who you are what you look like or how you identify except pedophiles fuck those guys
this is why queer history is important
the fact that so many people are willing to throw all gays under the bus because a few gays are willing to take this stance is concerning
i don t think it s racist or transphobic they are two complementary but different communities with two different sets of issues like latin issues and black issues sexual orientation is not the same as gender identity we should be allies to support each other but not at the expense of minimizing or marginalizing the issues that go along with sexual orientation which is a legitimate issue in itself just as transgender is a legitimate issue itself there is nothing wrong with gay pride or lesbian pride or transgender pride and they don t always have to be combined
standard fascist dividing procedure
what a stupid comment does he think that he is not next if not stopped this doesn t end
i m honestly asking what s the difference between lesbian gay and queer
wait cutting the t is one shitty thing but claiming lgb and cutting the q seems off
it s makes alot of sense to be honest some of the ideology of the tg community directly conflicts with the lgb section unless of course you think that lesbians should be forced to find biological men who identify as women as attractive
gays i m better than you lesbians no i m better than you bis we are all one is love trans look everyone we are all small minorities of the population that are all being oppressed in many of the same ways if we ban together more people will hear our voice and listen gays lesbians bis shut up yah tranny well at least we can agree on something w a s p s

i agree transphobic but what s the racist part
deleted
okay but how is this racist i feel like you just used the word racist to get more clicks i see absolutely nothing to do with race here
this will backfire in tennessee we re talking about tennessee here
how will it backfire this is exactly what tn votes for
the voters don t care the republicans are mirroring the sentiment of citizens of tennessee
get out and vote people
tn turning into quite the shithole
i would like for you to tell me how this is going to backfire on the state of tn if there was even the tiniest hint that it could then it wouldn t have been done in the first place this is not going to cause tn to suddenly become a blue state and vote the entire republican government out of office tomorrow it will be yesterday s news and come election time no one will remember it need proof mass shooting in texas nothing changed despite all the young people that are going to change the state more than one mass shooting in florida nothing changed despite all the young people that are going to change the state please educate us on how this is going to backfire on tn
what can i do from wisconsin as a democrat
no it won t tennessee is prime klan country nobody s going to do jack shit if blacks and progressives want to change tennessee they need to get their lazy asses out and vote
i doubt it
nope it wont
tennessee should be relocated between georgia and florida to avoid confusion
fuck tennessee again fucking racist rednecks
i m not saying race places no factor in this but if i m not mistaken she wasn t expelled since they didn t have as much evidence on her i watched the hearing and it seemed all she did was walk to the stand and because of that they didn t have a legal reason to expel her they didn t for anyone but you get what i m saying they wanted to but she didn t participate as much not saying it was right of course we all agree this was ridiculous i don t even doubt racists made this decision but just including some context for those who may not have watched it
by one vote she almost got expelled too but still baaaad optics actually if i were that woman i think i would walk out in sympathy and refuse to take my seat again until my colleagues were re instated
i know rep justin pearson he won t quit and we won t quit with him
did you not watch it it was historic
never spend any money in tn
i m guessing blind here that the state is so thoroughly gerrymandered that even if they all voted it still wouldn t affect the balance of power
victim blaming at its finest bravo damn lazy n energy
i won t deny it was historic i will deny that it is going to change anything in how tn votes or runs it s politics except maybe now that they have done it once they will just expel everyone they don t want
there is serious voter apathy in the south everybody crowed about how desantis cruised to victory in florida but of people under never voted more than half of black people in states like tennessee don t vote or bother to try if you re not voting you re just handing it to the racists because i can tell you for fuckin goddamn sure of the old white reactionaries vote every election last time i went to vote nearly everybody there was older than me and i m old
not at all a better analogy would be old europe thinking hitler was going to save them from the communists democracy doesn t work if you don t participate and we have literally the worst rate of participation in the developed world
i know seeing it gave me a hope that i think many gen z and millennials needed rather badly it will not change the gop but it will give people the hope to continue fighting against the gop this will motivate the non voters
this is exactly what it was they tested the waters now expect pre1950 s and then some i m not sure if any of the it s going to backfire crowd chiming in here have been to tn lately but the vast majority white folk there love it sadly expect more
you generalize an entire group and i m suppose to take your word at face value don t even ask why just jump to these people have been lazy can t say i m surprised to see such rhetoric on the whitepeople sub reddit of all places lol this is the remnants of the confederacy that white folks refused to stomp out during the late 19th century but sure blame the progressive and blacks you even saying blacks is suspect making your ancestors proud
pretty sure we said that about trump and roe and the past two supreme court appointments and a million other things and we have been let down every single time i am not getting my hopes up that this will be the thing that inspired engagement and chance i hope it is but so far our country has proven that they really don t give a shit
you re the one generalizing not me you know nothing about me or my experience but you re full of assumptions and you ve got your history kind of mixed up tennessee was never part of the confederacy the reason shit like this happens is because people surrender their power when you don t vote you surrender your power you hand it to angry old white men who kick black people out of elected office because they have the power and they re not afraid to use it wake up you can piss and moan and protest all you want that won t change anything
was a big win for blue runoff elections big blue win midterms big blue win wi judge big blue win since trump won in it s just been blue blue blue and is gonna be even bluer baby
you already have you hope it is keep fighting keep educating their children and ours they have given us a voice in government that unites us in our frustration it is a signal to people who felt like they were not represented that someone in government is them it has already given people power to call out the gop in ways that they have not been able to before we will be let down more but battles are not the war one way or another we won this battle
deleted
but so far our country has proven that they really don t give a shit consider the great red tsunami that wasn t in
this is my country too and i give a shit
don t undersell the effect roe s reversal is having i m originally from kansas and if you told me that the voters would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution by voting down a confusingly written rushed through midterm bill i would have told you to pass what you re smoking that only happened because conservative women voted against their own party en masse
it s the ideology that seeped into a great of white people it s not about tennessee being apart of the confederacy and i don t need to know shit about you i know enough you even phrasing your argument the way i ve had tells me enough i ve had this conversation before you are not the first white dude to suggest hey vote i m not going to spell out context for you cuz you would never understand or even care if we re honest don t pretend you care because if you did the approach would be waay different
all those votes beautiful
really isn t the house under trumpublican control
i hope you re right
american christian values aren t values ignore their words and look at what they actually do it s about hatred it s about undue vilification all to make them feel better about their own failings almost all of these types of christians are actually very bad people doing some seriously fucked up shit they re just evil people who figured out if they pretend to be good people and pay a few bucks on sunday they can keep their conscience clear and aggressively pretend to others they re good
the only way for them to legally see a vagina is to make that shit legal
the dude who passed the bill looks all sweaty at the thought of it i d swear this is the entire reason he s gone into politics in the first place kindergarten orgies
i m going to bet that kids will not join sports teams in the numbers that they do now might even start a boycott
just can t wait until they have us all lining up for weekly inspections freaking perverts
soon they will be doing virginity inspections as well and handing out jail time for women who have sex under coming soon https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/08/world/turks-clash-over-defense-of-virginity-tests.html
democrats are pedophiles says senior gop child genitalia inspector
it s because they are pedos hence all of the dems are pedo talk they wanted to get in front and accuse the other side of what we know them to be
voting republican equals a vote for legalized child molestation and people voting that way should be treated accordingly
you want to play t ball little timmy okay first thing you have to do is show this stranger your dick
groom oppress project that s the motto of the gopedos
gop genital ogling pedophiles
here s the thing as long as they are focusing on family values and the greater culture war they can distract their voters from the smoking trashfire they turned the country into
and yet they blame dems for mutilating genitals fuck the gop
nobody expects the spanish inquisition except republicans
i am a christian and i have a few words to say the the republicans i m not allowed to say them
republicans are the real groomers and pedos
no hate like christian love
the real pedophiles
this is annoying because there are a lot of christian values that talk about income inequality the book of james has a good portion of it mentioning how it s a sin to dishonor the poor and acknowledges that the rich exploit you at least in my interpretation i m not christian per say yet but i m trying to be more understanding so seeing people particularly certain gop members spout christian values but do no redeemable deeds is straight up blasphemous
you think there will be a split on which gender they decide to visually inspect or is it going to be girls girls slight edge to boys like
stop voting for them that s how we change the landscape of what we want america to be
where are the parents protesting this i don t have a child but i would be raising hell if i did and lived in kansas
extremism is scary
my root cause analysis is that they don t want girls and women playing sports
democrats should put this shit on blast in every single ad campaign they run alongside clips of reps claiming dems are pedos drive the stake home to roost
all modern systemic problems in the us are caused by billionaires oligarchs and billionaire oligarchs
american christianity is literally antichrist worship as defined by the bible the god they re worshiping isn t the god of their predecessors
republicans are grooming us for fascism
who are you to question the american taliban
christianity is synonymous with child molestation
they are just falling in line with their party leader don the con trump who grab em by the pussy
gif giphy zunj321u7hbvnr10jg downsized
this statement implies democrats give a shit they do not we do not have any politicians interested in your well being aside from bernie
what republican is wanting to inspect the vaginas and genitals of kids since this is blatantly illegal it s safe to say linda li is full of horse shit
if your a student and know someone who is going to allow this in order to play sports be sure to put a banana in their tail pipe and cut the break lines on their cars
i mean the left isn t any better
this is all a south park episode waiting to happen
welcome to christo fascism republicans are getting desperate with their discrimination laws
being anti regulation is only so that companies can keep fucking people society
i mean vaginas are genitals but yeah this is facts
republicans are the cult of sex and death at this rate the gop chair will be woody allen
is there any fundamentalist value more sacred than raping little children tho it seems to be what fundies do best often to their own children
i went to a born again christian school in 5th grade the 2nd graders class hamster died and the school all had a funeral small school and in the middle of this the principal had to take a moment to remind us all that animals definitely did not have souls and there would not be pets in heaven but we wouldn t care because we would be with god by the time he was done the whole school was in virtual hysterics since he really took the time to drive that point home i am now and still remember the banal cruelty of that moment where making a theological point was more important than comforting children

we follow gun toting jebus here
can t tell you how many people freaked out at me in my religious high school private jesuit school for how i chose to live life they lived just as sinfully as the rest of us but scoffed at how others lived because they just got forgiven for all the bad stuff they did that weekend at church on sunday
they arent christians they are wolves in the open
i had one of my right wing friends complain to me that there are so few republican women in the country today and i could only respond with well yeah it s kinda hard to find a woman that thinks you know what sounds good for me less rights
and for them to see it on a small child who cant say no otherwise
he doesn t have to risk arrest for downloading kiddie porn anymore
i hope their states loose college kids
correct they can blame all the problems of failing economic and social systems on the others
how so
the left is better we re not pedophiles like you are
they aren t transphobic bigots
buh both sides are bad guys but my only source is fox news
i went to catholic school for a few years in elementary school i was told the same thing about my pets i mark this day as the beginning of my antitheism
they re absolutely christians just because you don t like what they re doing doesn t make them less christian get out of here with your no true scotsman bs
they re definitely christian s
my dad learned to finally stop trying to get us to change our political views because every time he d bring up trump or any of them we d just start asking him why he hated his own daughters and list off a lot of shit they ve done anytime a new boyfriend comes around he ll try it again until he realizes we wouldn t be dating guys who agreed with that kind of logic he s single and divorced so i think there s a pattern
you get any kind of a response
you know stuff like drag queen shows for kids or giving kids puberty blocker s
whats a no true scotsmans bs
love that pie
and yet not a single drag queen has been in the news for harming a child sexually but you know who have been republicans whether it be from church or otherwise as for giving puberty blockers do more research that s between a doctor and their patient
what exactly is as bad about drag shows for kids as it is about republican refusal to regulate railroads after several disastrous crashes
wow this is a stupid comment
it s a logical fallacy in short person who is member of x group did y thing i don t approve of or want to be associated with therefore person is not really a member of group x https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman#:~:text=no%20true%20scotsman%2c%20or%20appeal,by%20excluding%20the%20counterexample%20improperly.
no it s about drags twerking to children there are various videos of it
thanks
who the fuck are drags
link a few
sorry if i am wrong english isn t my first language
aha i take it there s gonna be a problem with providing sources on those videos of twerking into children s faces right
other reports have them saying you ban books you ban drag kids are still in body bags
next up republicans ban gun ownership by democratic voters
i would have gone with you put kids in body bags but that s just me
you d need to be a halfway decent person for that to work on you unfortunately so no dice
they don t care they are drunk on power
i genuinely think every single republican gets off to school shootings
republicans take all three points as good news mass shootings even when it s kids being killed ensures a boost in gun sales gun sales rise and gunmakers profits routinely increase in the aftermath of highly publicized mass shootings for example after the sandy hook elementary school shooting in and the san bernardino terrorist attack in gun sales jumped by million and million respectively based on normal buying patterns these numbers exceeded expectations by more than million sales in months leading up to these events the deviations from predicted buying patterns were consistently less than extra sales senate gov https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9bfdef03-67b9-49d3-8252-23f7b90a01d6/jec-gun-industry-profits-final.pdf)
damn that is catchy
they don t care
they are right
this is the terf version lol
you know they re thinking of that
that s crazy they ll target minorities first
that s definitely one of the final steps just going right out and saying it and people will still defend it like the ultimate tell they don t have any actual principles not that we don t already know that
better boys in body bags than dresses obviously
you d need to be a person these bigots are not people they are a scourge and a virus
compelled to resign no i think instead of compelling them to resign there should be either term limits or some way to legally remove a corrupt justice like impeachment
isn t that tax fraud he should be charged with the last years with tax fraud if he doesn t resign
its galling that thomas was ever confirmed but allowing him to hold his seat is a cancer on justice and checks and balances
clarence isn t going anywhere unless tossed out that s not happening because the number of votes needed are not there of the senate asked to resign can you hear his laughter he ll continue taking gifts with a finger and a chuckle to anyone who objects
compelled by what a conscious hardy fuckin har
compelled to resign how about thrown in prison for treason
harlan crow is a fantastic corporate villain name who gets him batman or spider man
or maybe they shouldn t be having them at all maybe it should be that it should not be legal for him to accept such gifts from anyone
is corruption legal in the usa because if not why are some people above the law
that drug dealer gave me some crack but i didn t ask for it yes it s in my possession officer but why am i being accused of a crime
he should have to resign regardless and face stiff tax penalties jail would be best
if they can make him resign for accepting lavish bribes believe me they will make you resign for doing the same because that s already law expected in most professions
how bout indicted
all government officials accepting bribes should tried for treason
the fact that a judge is allowed to take donations at all is just mind blowing
i m going to plan my next vacation from work to help encourage him
corrupt as it gets so far
when you are the law you re above the law
he needs to step down his reputation and actions are wrong and immoral he has had red flag after red flag for years now
fcpa lol sort out your judiciary
thomas has no choice but to dig in his heels and continue these trips anything else is admission he is doing something wrong possibly breaking the law again
impeach
thomas taking bribes is considered a crime by democrats but is considered as street cred by republicans
no one wanted to believe anita i still have my bumper sticker that says i believe anita hill
this is not a resign situation it is accepting bribes and corruption a criminal offence
fuck him fuck him and his stupid fucking wife fuck the good conservatives who support him out of loyalty fuck biden i like joe for anita hill fuck everyone who let this piece of shit become a scotus
fuck resign how about prosecuted
you can impeach a supreme court justice but good luck for it ever happening
yes you can t shame these people they actively support an insurrection put people like marjorie taylor greene on committees and will scramble to be the first to humiliate themselves for trump
or an actual option that biden could do pack the court with many more justices and make thomas s inane votes a rounding error but that would take political courage and sleepy joe just doesn t have it he might upset some of those fine delaware businessmen he s spent his career sucking off
better yet he won t resign unless a republican gets in office next election
just you know go vote harder or something
a harlan crow anyone associated with the crow crime family in justified
through citizens united yes
it s almost as if you corrupt all three branches of government they fail to hold each other accountable
yeah is this impeachment like we had with trump a vote to impeach and absolute inaction
to do so requires a majority of the house to vote yes and there is no way that will happen with it being republican controlled then it requires 3rds of the senate to convict and that also will never happen so while theoretically justices can be impeached there s less than zero chance of it happening
courage or wisdom it might be wiser to leave it at a number held since vice president joe biden democratic presidential nominee is wary of court packing stating in no i m not prepared to go on and try to pack the court because we ll live to rue that day he later elaborated we add three justices next time around we lose control they add three justices we begin to lose any credibility the court has at all yeah it sucks right now because the scotus is clearly partisan but packing it would make it look even more partisan rather than balanced reducing doesn t help either all current justices have a lifetime appointment the reduced number would only take effect as justices left by usual circumstances
i feel like we could get republicans on our side by just throwing democrat and george soros on this they already think it s true
nice pull that works too
unfortunately that corruption won t last as the people very much still have power if they didn t trump would be president right now
what the corruption won t last oh my sweet summer child
wait it s been corrupt all along always has executes astronaut then sprinkles crack on the body and leaves a 9mm in their hand who could possibly have committed this crime well better arrest the nearest black year old
i used to work in the medical field my mother is an rn and i know several nurses and doctors they will treat anyone from fucking rapist murderer brought in by police to a saint if you can t accept that your job is to treat no matter who is in front of you then do not go into that field you will not last long
it s called the hippocratic oath not the hypocrite oath
as a nurse i fully agree it s not our job to judge people but to give them the best possible medical treatment anything else is highly unprofessional i ve treated plenty of patients i wouldn t want to associate with in private i cared for dying jehovas witnesses because they refused treatment criminals handcuffed to the bed racists preachy judgmental nuns and many others i might vent about them to my colleagues but i never would ve the audacity to refuse medical care if you can t do that get an office job
hey student being a close minded asshole is a lifestyle being lgbtq is just being
i m a general surgery resident last week we had a white guy in his 20s who came in as a trauma activation after being in a bad car collision where he was unrestrained and ejected from the vehicle ruptured spleen belly full of blood tachycardic borderline hypotensive we took him to the or and took it out saved his life i say that because as we cut his clothes off in the trauma bay we all immediately we all noticed the giant ss lightning bolt tattoo on his chest he also had a few other smaller similar ones we got the message on our trauma team at the moment the intern is a hispanic woman the second year resident is an indian man i am the chief resident jewish and the attending trauma surgeon is a black woman you do not and cannot let any bias interfere with treating the patient you let it go do your job and move on having said that post op after the guy woke up and we were able to talk about what happened i think some sort of light came on in his head he was incredibly polite and respectful to my attending always saying yes ma am no ma am all that stuff is he still probably a racist yeah but he will walk around for the rest of his life with a scar from the time the people he hated saved his life idk if that balances out the nazi tats but we ll see i guess
the sad thing is this shouldn t be amazing this should be the norm god this country is fucked

good on the professor the world needs ditch diggers too billy gif giphy o8jt7bkfbbbus
the way i see it people like that need to be fired from the medical field your job is to help people and put them above whatever else if you cant do that then you shouldnt work in a hospital
seriously i treat conservatives even though i don t agree with their lifestyle when you sign up to help people that means all people
it s the same with vaccines if you can t accept the science go into a different profession
do no harm
hippocratic oath
you get really good at not judging people like it just doesn t even factor in until afterwards even then it s like wow that guy was an ass huh you d burn out so fast if you re going to fret about who you re helping in a self centered manner
the hippocratic oath is what every medical practitioner takes because of this path medical practitioners must provide accurate treatment to the best of their abilities to a patient regardless of their personal feelings towards the patient
the hippocratic oath is what you take to become a doctor the hypocrite oath is what you take to become a member of the gop
could you have sewn a jew fixed this into the sutures probably unethical but i would have died laughing
ditch diggers don t get to pick and choose their customers either
unfortunately in my experience they do judge a lot and it will affect your treatment outcomes they will still treat you but they can be slow to requests not give adequate pain medication not believe you when you tell them symptoms require unessesary testing etc for example it s been shown that women are less likely to receive adequate pain management medical staff judge that they are exaggerating their pain so they don t give them as much medication i know someone with chronic kidney stones who was treated like a drug seeker before getting a specialist for it they ve had a dangerous amount of ct scans because it was the only way the hospital would give pain medication
i was accused of seeking pain meds because i called to tell my doctor that the pain in my ankle didn t go away after a spring loaded kickstand hit me in the ankle bone i got a little snippy and told them i wasn t looking for more medicine i was looking to be referred to a doctor who would actually take me seriously since the doctor i saw did literally nothing to diagnose me other than an exam turns out i had a bone bruise another time i had gallstones and the doctor insisted nothing was wrong that maybe i had a stomach bug despite the pain being higher than that i specifically requested an ultrasound i was right it was gallstones
as a straight cisgender white male these things have all happened to me except for the kidney stones were they judging me
fucking this
yes if they thought you were exaggerating pain that is a judgement if they treated you like a drug seeker when you weren t that is a judgement if they don t believe you when you tell them symptoms that is a judgement being slow to requests not giving adequate pain management and requiring unnecessary testing can all be influenced by the judgements made about you but can be for other reasons as well this isn t solely a race and or gender issue but those are common things that influence people s perceptions of you
ever notice how the party of personal responsibility never seems to want to be responsible for their person
i applaud for diagnosing a legitimate illness
so he was a standard viewer then
foxitus and foxmania is dangerous and widespread trans people are not dangerous stop the bullshit prosecute the real criminals and stop the persecution of the innocent
so the brilliant defense is fox news lies and that my client is stupid enough to believe them well
affluenza was another excuse closely adjacent to fox flu
it s like living in the brainwashing scene from a clockwork orange but voluntarily
yup
actually if when fox loses the dominion suit this could become a standard defense for its viewers
if that s their defence then they should have to file a suit against fox
i present to you the party of personal responsibility
no way so out of character
fine i am willing to entertain this excuse as soon as tony tony files suit against fox news
oh no sounds like he needs a few years in prison to detox from the fox
this article was written by tobin smith a former fox commentator it has since turned into a book called foxocracy pay special attention to the section on the formula they use for their programs it s the equivalent of giving the brain a hit of crack considering the source i did look more into it it is a real thing https://medium.com/@tobinsmith_95851/how-roger-ailes-fox-news-scammed-americas-la-z-boy-cowboys-for-21-years-1996ee4a6b3e
yeah it does seem like fox news is a virus that causes and sustains irrational beliefs a general inability to empathize with people who differ for the watcher and marked aversion to comprehending real life facts people can be smart and kind in every day life but turn that lie machine on and they just lose perspective
are you sure it s not related to 4chanitis
also known as stupidity
he should file suit against fox and he should press his lawyer to make it a class action if millions of mouth breathers hear that they could get money they d be dumb enough to sign on
so the people who perpetrated j6 shouldn t be held accountable for trying to overthrow democracy because they were tainted by fox news but fox also shouldn t be held accountable for the harmful misinformation they spread because no reasonable person would believe them when does the absolute pants on head stupidity of all this actually end and why do i have a sinking feeling the answer is never
foxitis is a self inflicted disease
i keep saying conservatism is an undiagnosed mental illness and i ll stop saying it when the cowards stop hiding from reality in their little safe spaces gif giphy 2vkpplpyhkwm4 downsized
the cure for foxitis is prison
actually easily one of the best and most competent defense strategies i ve seen so far for these chumwits
given the findings in the dominion case look for this strategy to become much more common
so this fool is claiming stupidity
didn t realize being stupid was a legal defense fuck that guy hope he goes to jail and cries
good let the lawsuits vs fauxnuuuuz begin
beware of affluenza
if that s true can we shut them down for being a public health risk
i believe it but hold accountable anyway these knuckleheads deserve everything they get
i see a class action lawsuit coming fox s way
file this next to affluenza as the stupidest excuses entitled people have used to justify their crimes
modern day twinkie defense
next up on the dominion witness list this guy
ok so is there a way to prosecute fox news and the former president for this or do we have to wait for fox to commit tax fraud too

i d put this up there with affluenza on the list of stupid fucking defenses that might actually work
foxmania is actually what competitive smash bros was like in
sucks to be him
needs a foxyotomy
fox groomed him
you see your honor my client is a fucking idiot
sounds like he should be committed then
or that the party of law and order ignoring the fact that their demigod broke laws and proceeded to melt down when accountability started
no one in it accepts it for any goddamn reason whatsofuckingever under any circumstances
you mean the party who blamed antifa and blm for jan
always the victim
i can get behind this one though may bring now fox news
it should be in the next dsm volume as a legitimate disorder we can call it member of a political or religious cult after being brainwashed by fox and friends
sadly this reminds me of my late mother who they had poisoned with their non stop lies and bullshit
in the immortal words of lt caffee my client s an idiot that s not against the law
i was just thinking it sounds similar i thought the affluenza thing got struck down in court though
wait stop i cant watch no stop it i beg you turn it of wait the minorities are coming to replace my heritage you say
fox s lawyers have already gone on record in previous court cases stating that their pundits aren t credible sources of factual information kinda surprised they didn t go ahead and preemptively extend that claim to the whole network
oh i really like this as a solution madastrid
amazing
your honor the fact that my client believed the bullshit he heard on fox news is clear evidence that he is not mentally competent to stand trial case dismissed
mass psychosis explains a lot
i stayed at my parents house a couple days last week and my step dad watched fox news non stop often while also browsing conservative media on his phone the stuff they were saying on tv was just psychotic like obsessive and psychotic they spent a whole segment in complaining about how obama didn t deserve a presidential library because he didn t do anything in his whole presidency it was like watching a stalker get their own tv show and explain all the warped logic they use to justify the stalking
unfortunately ethan is out on probation for killing people
damn
no she lifted helfself out of poverty cause she got knocked up by a sex offender who happened to have a lucrative gas and oil job that supported her shitty diarrhea gun restaurant until she got elected in a heavily gerrymandered district that apparently didn t have anyone better than a year old drop out grandma
i love it when they start their anti socialism rant with i came up from welfare yes that s exactly what that s for and that s exactly why we should keep it and even expand on it thank you for making my argument for me
the toned deafness of saying i used these social programs but lets get rid of them so no one else can do what i did is somehow not surprising
she survived on government socialism but wants to take down the socialist system that she praised can t be any dumber
fucking idiot these two sentences literally contradict each other standing in line for government assistance is literally a form of socialism i m so tired of it s ok for me but not for you bullshit from these people they commit crime it s not a big deal anyone else go to jail they take government assistance they did it all by themselves anyone else takes it they re a lazy socialist pig the list like this goes on and on fuck these hypocrites
how can she not see the hypocrisy in her own words
oh we didn t her followers however forget within minutes every time it s pointed out
so blinded by hate she can t see the insane hypocrisy she s vomiting
educated the effectiveness of that is questionable but the intent was valid
it takes a village to raise an idiot or am i mixing my medifores
um i don t think any of those words mean what she thinks they mean i do realize that s not saying much at this point
so you waited on the government to float you as you got out of poverty but everyone else should do it on their own instead boebert is inching ever closer to overtaking mtg as the biggest dumbfuck on twitter
lauren should focus more on her family and her son getting a young teenager pregnant rather than being on twitter saying pointless things family of losers the boeberts
what a stupid qunt
at her age she did not stand in line for cheese she was born in by the time she could stand in a line it was over
i agree with bpebert people should be empowered to lift themselves out of poverty depending on the government for that is a recipe for abuse of power in the long run now would she care to support and enforce movements towards that end like idk be against bills that enforce government control such as nationwide ban of books genitalia checks internet website bannings no well she is then in favor of government control
hate socialism but brags about how she lived the american dream using socialism i can t even
wait she s bragging about using government handouts and then telling people how she wants to not allow government handouts i m absolutely shocked there are people who look to this bitch as some sort of beacon of knowledge
where has all your money came from can t run a restaurant lawyer bills for husband
_i benefitted from effective social programs so you don t have to _
you are a ho you fucked your way out of poverty and try to make it like you used your pea brain gtfooh
why did you ever give that rat cheese
that idiot probably thought it was a magic portal all those funds and food fell out of
what the fuck i survived and eventually succeeded because i had welfare but welfare prevents people from succeeding
ouch
this is my favorite post of the internet
buuuurn
buried her
to be fair her being alive and well is a valid argument against the specific programs that helped her jk even a child destined for bad things deserves to eat
i ve been on foodstamps and welfare did anyone help me out no ole craig t nelson
that s conservatism seize every opportunity presented to you and then do everything you can to gatekeep those opportunities from everybody else
remember the brain surgeon who said the same these ppl are nutz
these two sentences literally contradict each other standing in line for government assistance is literally a form socialism this is what is known as doublespeak or cognitive dissonance and it s the glue that keeps the republican party s house from collapsing in on itself
low iq it s a real thing
it was taken out of context the whole tweet
minutes it s in the same fucking tweet
no no you got it right
and what missing context changes the meaning
i m so sorry that comment was lazy asf of me that s the rep saying dems are always taking shit out of context which is hilarious because you can t take anything out of context when the whole of it tweet press statement etc is used iow this is s and they re always talking shit but that s what it always is shit content lol edit my jokes sux
so none lol yeah thought you forgot the s but it s the internet so i waited to hear the possible gaslighting or projection
how is this happening in america and how is this little dictator wannabe getting away with so much
this is insane i urge people to go and read the entire thread she is a former whistle blower and the state arrested her son for sharing a meme a week after we filed our lawsuit against the state a kid claiming to be the cousin of one of my son s classmates joined their snapchat group they recorded their conversations and anonymously reported my son to police for sharing a popular internet meme the meme is innocuous and its an extreme stretch to call it terrorism its also really questionable on the circumstances on which this evidence was claimed she asked on whose orders it was and the police officers said that it was from the state of florida i want to do some more verifying personally and im sure we will get that but i believe it on its face this is actual fascism there is no sugar coating it anymore this is the direction we are headed in the state literally kidnapped this ladies child because desantis had beef with her parent they even raided her and pointed guns in her face its also very clear that she is a thorn in desantis s side this is the actual violation of rights that republicans scream about to victimize themselves only its actually happening
this is one of the most unbelievable things i never thought i would read about in modern america the escalations these fascist fucks have taken in the last few days is very very concerning i think this is the 5th time i have said what the actual fuck in utter disbelief this week and the one non surprising thing this week the former president being charged with felonies so far what in the actual fuck america
you don t have to spend your vacation dollars there find somewhere else good place just to stay away from
wow just wow if true i hope all the major news outlets pick this up and investigate
florida is a shit hole
i genuinely wish i knew what the state of this country is going to be in in years i don t know how much longer i can cope with the doom that is our future
desantis represents fascism in america
we need the us government to check in on the attacks in social media over this the attempts to shut down anyone who brings this up in places like twitter or facebook we need to stop desantis attacking people the odd attacks on disney actors
didn t desantis try and pass a law that would make it illegal to say something negative about him online
the doj could get involved and certainly should listens to the crickets in the backyard party at merrick garland s house along with the laughter of all the usual gqp leadership
if they truly arrested him over the meme she shared there has to be some way to prosecute that right i don t want it to be true because i m afraid i m watching desantis and others get away with everything he is doing and i don t know how to deal with it i feel like we should be able to do something to stop this but i don t know how
well desantis is fucking terrifying
what the actual fuck
omfg i hope she and her son get through this quickly and safely
nobody who lives in a red state is safe they will do whatever the fuck they want
taken on the governor s orders i feel like this is something the president can act on

what meme did her son share that caused his arrest
worse than trump
some parts of the us are doing what germany did years ago but way slower it truly looks like they re trying to turn the majority of the population towards a more right wing and sry if i m mistaken a more fascist point of view and moral i come from a countey where we essentially invented and mass produced fascism and the records memories of people who lived then are really really starting to overlap with what s happening in the us i wouldn t be surpised if next year is goint to end up being one of their most tumultuous in recent history good luck my american friends it s probably gonna be super hard for another while but i hope you get through
this and the other moves they ve made in the last few days signal they are going in to full swing and we are just sitting here postulating about it this is not how this gets fixed i don t know what can be done to stop this but our kids will ask us what we did when it all fell apart what will we say
how the fuck isn t the media all over this
imagine de santis having access to the u s military and nukes
i m mostly shocked rebekah jones still lives in florida after all the shit that went down before
you see my colleague went on one doesn t see exactly where or how to move believe me this is true each act each occasion is worse than the last but only a little worse you wait for the next and the next you wait for one great shocking occasion thinking that others when such a shock comes will join with you in resisting somehow you don t want to act or even talk alone you don t want to go out of your way to make trouble why not well you are not in the habit of doing it and it is not just fear fear of standing alone that restrains you it is also genuine uncertainty uncertainty is a very important factor and instead of decreasing as time goes on it grows outside in the streets in the general community everyone is happy one hears no protest and certainly sees none you know in france or italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences in germany outside the great cities perhaps there is not even this in the university community in your own community you speak privately to your colleagues some of whom certainly feel as you do but what do they say they say it s not so bad or you re seeing things or you re an alarmist and you are an alarmist you are saying that this must lead to this and you can t prove it these are the beginnings yes but how do you know for sure when you don t know the end and how do you know or even surmise the end on the one hand your enemies the law the regime the party intimidate you on the other your colleagues pooh pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic you are left with your close friends who are naturally people who have always thought as you have but your friends are fewer now some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work you no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings informal groups become smaller attendance drops off in little organizations and the organizations themselves wither now in small gatherings of your oldest friends you feel that you are talking to yourselves that you are isolated from the reality of things this weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to to what it is clearer all the time that if you are going to do anything you must make an occasion to do it and then you are obviously a troublemaker so you wait and you wait but the one great shocking occasion when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you never comes that s the difficulty if the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest thousands yes millions would have been sufficiently shocked if let us say the gassing of the jews in had come immediately after the german firm stickers on the windows of non jewish shops in but of course this isn t the way it happens in between come all the hundreds of little steps some of them imperceptible each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next step c is not so much worse than step b and if you did not make a stand at step b why should you at step c and so on to step d and one day too late your principles if you were ever sensible of them all rush in upon you the burden of self deception has grown too heavy and some minor incident in my case my little boy hardly more than a baby saying jewish swine collapses it all at once and you see that everything everything has changed and changed completely under your nose the world you live in your nation your people is not the world you were born in at all the forms are all there all untouched all reassuring the houses the shops the jobs the mealtimes the visits the concerts the cinema the holidays but the spirit which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms is changed now you live in a world of hate and fear and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves when everyone is transformed no one is transformed now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to god the system itself could not have intended this in the beginning but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way copyright notice excerpt from pages of they thought they were free the germans by milton mayer
jesus fucking christ this shit is getting really scary
feds need to put florida under marshall law
sounds like tallahassee is in need of some hell raising
jesus christ get the un to america to sort this shit out it s getting out of hand now
i m not american but isn t what happened against freedom of speech
retaliating against the person serving you a lawsuit is definitely not going to help your case
did y all see what he wrote he gave a date when he planned to shoot up the school and said he wanted to get a shirt that matched the columbine shooters and talked about stabbing other students he said his antidepressant medication wasn t working and he was going to go ahead with his plan if this was actually political retribution then call out desantis but my gosh sounds like he was an actual threat
all because they planted a cop in her year old son s chat room with friends and at some point he shared a meme of a fat cop asleep with words similar to waiting for a school shooting to happen or something similar think about that they were surveilling juveniles children with no probable cause if that is the case ron job needs to come get me too because my family spent the entire time trump was in court trolling the nyc courb police i am late middle age with mobility issues and i posited that i m pretty sure i could outrun all but about three of them and one in particular i d give easy money would drop from a massive coronary after about feet guess i m a terrorist too
all of our illinois governors went to prison it s not hard to jail a governor there s no way desantis can win i ll bet you money he s gonna end up in prison
fuck ron desantis
i just left a breakfast where everyone n the room was praising the right and speaking highly of greg abbott mind you everyone excluding me was over fifty it s relieving to hop on the internet and see that the country isn t totally ruined
doj needs to start investigating this immediately this cannot stand
i hate that i served
this is what happened last time https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/florida-ig-report-insufficient-evidence-desantis-critics-claims-covid-rcna30647](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/florida-ig-report-insufficient-evidence-desantis-critics-claims-covid-rcna30647) desantis is a criminal
why does he have such a vendetta against this poor woman there has to be more people that did things he didn t like right he couldn t just become the governor without experiencing a lot of that he is behaving like a petulant rich bastard that never heard the word no
mass protests where he is being held at the governors mansion and there need to be mass calls to our federal doj
can the federal government do something like could they withhold federal monies from florida s because of stunts he pulls
from the pensacola news journal in the messages to his friends the teenager made the following statements among others i want to shoot up the school if i get a gun i m gonna shoot up hnms lol https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/
it would appear florida is now east germany and florida s governor is head of stasi style organization
fuck meatball ron
they took her son
i would invite everyone to read the book it can t happen here
this is full blown fascist not even hiding it anymore going after the children of your political opponents is disgusting having a snitch go and join the kids snap chat group to then snitch about a meme is the biggest bitch move i have ever heard
sometimes i wonder if desantis prefers the title of fhrer or duce
can someone point me in the direction to learn about this or give me a quick rundown
gerrymandering checks and balances
can we just arrest this fascist pos like he is on record admitting to leading the charge of human trafficking falsifying government records a slue of other things and now he is having his political opponents arrested which is false imprisonment and kidnapping drag the pos out in chains for the whole world to see this will only get worse idgaf if he is a governer
just like the nazis republicans keep thinking as long as it s the opposition it s fine
why do people keep believing her
yet more proof that florida is the syphilitic dong of the us
well this is what floridians wanted since they voted him in as governor charlie christ could have saved florida fortunately desantis can t run again there is hope
what happened to the free speech they love so much
blatant fascism playing out right in front of american s eyes will they stand up and do the right thing or sit down and take it like a good little sub i think we all know the answer
i know most of y all don t want to hear this but this is the exact reason many of us on the left have ar s pushing to disarm ourselves when it ll be virtually impossible to disarm right wing fascists is nothing but liberal idealism and until we stamp out every last one of these proto fascist strongmen it s dangerous
who dis
desantistan
it s not a bug it s a feature calling desantis a fascist who would be king is like slathering greasy bacon on republican voter s bellies mmm bacon
wondering what the conversation surrounding this meme looked like hard to believe anything anymore because we only get to see a very small zoomed in snapshot of the entire picture
where the fuck is the federal government what the fuck is happening
histrionic personality disorder
from what i m reading this wasn t a one off meme multiple memes and a lot of talking about school shootings to multiple people this isn t as innocent as it s being made to sound i m afraid i m as anti desantis as anyone but this seems to misrepresent what actually happened
fuck desantis
hopefully she gets her son back
this is the same women who had her house raided by police after whistle blowing about florida lying about covid numbers
i don t know i would name every single person that they send they can t just say i m doing my job when they know it is an illegal and purely retribution against this person i m also wondering what the fbi is going to be doing about this because this is purely amendment violations at this point
he s going to send his nazi jackboot fucks to the wrong house soon enough and they are going to get the american second amendment treatment face full of lead isnt florida like the most extreme castle doctrine state the irony of the ultra rights huge hardon for guns and the second amendment is that proliferation of firearms and the random shootings it contributes to is maybe the only thing that s making some voters start to second guess voting republican and when the far right starts to really grind their heel on their constituents it will be that same right to buy just about any sort of firearm unimpeded that will become an issue for their fledgling fascist state
this sub is even dumber than i thought if they believe rebekah jones seriously if you are this easily duped by her than you re terminally stupid no downvoting me isn t going to make it all better
do you think deathsantos has had her kid disappeared yet i m just asking questions here
today is all looking like the fall of rome
that meme ain t sh though are they serious i ve seen worse and that is by far a very tame meme many a kid or adult would share this is definitely personal i hope everyone involved in doing this to this woman and her family will be investigated
as an american mom who s working to get my kids and i the fuck out of here her tweet reply is haunting me they took jack they took my son i should have left tula we waited too long https://twitter.com/georebekah/status/1643794582314926080?s=46&t=ih7fzd5xstgbdlksmybqaa)
she s lying her son was not charged with sharing a popular internet meme like she claims he was arrested for making threats on social media to shoot up his school https://preview.redd.it/bvl0ck6hycsa1.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a556ea45505304436ba1807b83f2c801bceeb1a7
this is only happening in florida we all need to get out and vote or this will be happening all over america trump set the tone for desantis to come in and make what trump did look like child s play
i hate this
man she s going to own florida and deathsantis
removed
the lady is a kook she has had erroneous claims before this isn t anything new watch out though resistance is futile
imaging believing this woman what a bunch of dummies
when are americans ever going to realize and accept that they re living in a fascist country every system they have treats them as slaves and expendable labor while the rich steal and plunder resources control their people with fear and invade other countries to steal their oil and other resources and plant military bases in others
i want out of florida but i don t have money to move its to the point if i happen to be reading the wrong book in a coffee shop i m afraid someone will attack me or worse
if you believe this story you need to be put on an assortment of antipsychotics
i m sure there s nothing more to the story
removed
deleted
this is ridiculous if this is true desantis needs to be behind bars himself are there laws against such actions if there aren t there should be he literally thinks he s some kind of fucking dictator and enough has to be enough at some point
yeah he got arrested for practicing free speech florida is now a fascist state
is there any actionable recourse i can take as a citizen here to help not a florida resident
good thing this is a complete lie from a well known liar
she s a liar her son was arrested for making threats on social media to shoot up his school https://preview.redd.it/a7plvhgrxcsa1.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d5cae3323420bf1f62989f54c5ac0a887eb952ee
this is outrageous
sounds like the fbi needs to get involved
we must not only defeat trump but also desantis
or there s reality https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article274038075.html
the great gop magic show watch republicans hilariously pull values out of thin air i think you meant ass instead of air as their values make them look like pieces of shit since you can look at the shit they ve done which included barring abortion with no exceptions for rape or if the baby can kill the woman banning books some of the other really shitty things they ve done
gif giphy akaefzallr0yi downsized republicans
this is a disgrace my republican ancestors did not slay tens of thousands of racist confederate democrats to have their party be ran like this we need reform among many many others
who is it that s protecting kids again awe who cares right centrists cause voting doesn t matter and who cares what happens fuckin losers
they also will not expel you for literally lying about your entire life story which included hiding one or more crimes along the way in order to get elected
i am not religious but fuck all that praise jesus for these two lawmakers that represent the people we need this everywhere put them back in power i cried when watching them this is the christianity that fights christofascism this is what america needs
praise be the rising
i m not saying he s jesus but if jesus came back he d come back as the most downtrodden race just like the first time that s probably not white
i think they are talking about a different jesus seems like it to me have you seen the pic
fox has literally become a parody it s like a fascist weekend update from snl
the democrats are targeting so many people for checks notes https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wapw049qwudjyezqd6uwi?si=nrwfh7ycqqgng5klvmnjmq&dd=1)* humm let me see here corruption https://open.spotify.com/episode/5hxw6l46twrp9r8v0jrvnl?si=2k4vsd5cqmgjipbt0kscca&dd=1). while we would love to give our government officials and former officials the benefit of the doubt looks down https://open.spotify.com/episode/4idxmbm0jncdudgy1ipzu7?si=bn5iiahcqt6gypzjdr7-aq&dd=1) again at pages of examples there is a burden of proof that needs to be addressed as in a burden of proof they committed corruption https://open.spotify.com/episode/4m1fi7rzbs1hacxiboafoy?si=w34ikkl0s6cyvagatbupxg&dd=1). i know they are podcast and they are long but they are funny and informative
remember when they used to pretend they were a legitimate news source those were the days
move along citizen nothing to see here
crimes are only ok when we do it
fucking corrupt ass bitch

is there a gate to hell hidden somewhere down there
so much for free speech eh edit i made this comment last night when this story was breaking and admittedly believed her version of events it appears she is trying to politicize her son being held accountable for making legitimate threats her son wasn t kidnapped she turned him over to the police willingly https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/
for his enablers just following illegal orders is not a defense
damn that s some dystopian bullshit
this is definitely an attempt to chill and curtail rebekah s free speech by a wannabe fascist this will inevitably get struck down as a 1st amendment issue but the pain of the arrest and legal process will still stay with that kid for years to come the meme isn t even that spicy fuck ron desantis and fuck people who want this kind of tinpot dictator bullshit in government
more context if this is accurate it s very scary https://mobile.twitter.com/esqueer_/status/1643787119859490817 edit it s never clear who to trust but this newspaper article says her kid is accused of making some serious threats to shoot up the school not just posting memes https://www.pnj.com/story/news/crime/2023/04/06/rebekah-jones-son-arrested-in-florida-what-we-know-about-digital-threat-allegations/70088634007/
we need to get desantis out he s already openly defied the constitution has no respect for civil rights literally kidnaps children at what point does the federal government intervene and remove this prick
oh mr torture lawyer from guantnamo bay is now arresting people s children in order to terrorize the parents so surprising what a shock
ah yes because nothing says freedom of speech like arresting a literal child for posting a meme online i hate these fascist fucks i m glad to be far away from the hellhole that is florida
for the record this is the same woman that desantis sicked the state police on to raid her home and steal her computer after she revealed florida s real covid numbers
desantis was humiliated by disney so now he s taking out his rage on anyone he can the doj needs to step in
any other country and the blue un tanks would be securing tallahassee by now
desantis is evil we need to keep his bullshit constrained to florida
anyone who supports desantis is a supporter of fascism
holy fuck
oh my fucking god what the hell
maybe it s time for fema to start a relocation program for people under who wish to flee their state
i really hope this isn t true but it wouldn t surprise me this is supervillain shit
the gop are fascists we should all be preparing for the nazis to try to take over we should be ready for it it s scary
the message seems to be that if you file a lawsuit against the state the state is going to find a reason to take your children brought to you by a leader of the small government party
this is exactly the kind of thing fascists do and desantis doesn t even pretend not to be a fascist anymore
the only reasonable response to fascism is nti fascism
just remember that it s the class traitors behind the thin blue line that happily carry out these orders they will do anything their masters instruct them to stay vigilant friends
so it begins i m fucking disgusted with this country
florida had better have a lotta fucking money for this family the doj also needs to get involved like yesterday
anyone have any details on this story
fascism pure and simple floridians are up for a reality check but when they realize they will be neck deep on this madness i m no longer visiting my friends there fuck that shit

desantis is such a fascists it s disgusting and very concerning
this is legitimately terrifying desantis is much more frightening than trump ever was the biden administration needs to step in immediately absolutely unacceptable
definitely doesn t have anything to do with the fact that she just sued weeks ago as a whistleblower for wrongful termination and back wages definitely nothing to do with that https://www.cityandstatefl.com/policy/2023/03/rebekah-jones-now-suing-state-florida-get-her-job-back-covid-whistleblower-lawsuit/383944/
this is terrifying i would say that desantis is the antichrist but if i remember correctly the antichrist is actually supposed to be a likable guy i didn t think it would be possible to be a bigger dirtbag than trump but well done desantis you re proving me wrong
yes of course desantis is using the fucking police and justice system to attack citizens desantis is a fascist this is what fascists do when they gain complete control over a government florida is lost it is a fascist state ruled by a fascist party same goes for north carolina wisconsin and tennessee montana and kansas are both working overtime to follow suit these are literal fascist gates rules by fascists they will do fascist things like impeach duly elected supreme court justices for not reason expel duly elected law makers override ballot measures create unreasonable barriers to voting such that no fair vote can take place use the police and judicial system to punish dissidents etc etc etc you can t vote fascists out of power using the system to stop the fascists has failed in these states and it will continue to fail in others until people stop being surprised when fascists do fascist things and start treating fascists appropriately
removed
republicans are okay with this but say trump needs to go to court for breaking actual laws and they start acting like the secret police are coming to town
on top of it her son is autistic first they raid her home and point guns at her son then matt the pedo gaetz takes a picture of her son and posts it online mocking him and now desantis kidnaps her son when does someone step in and do something this is terrorism
i was living in florida when she exposed the state s attempt to falsify covid data i remember there were character assassination articles going around characterizing her as the crazy ex girlfriend a hysterical and emotional woman and then a few weeks later one of the government department s listserves was hacked or an unauthorized email was sent to everyone and the florida police were breaking into her house with a warrant accusing her of sending the email but wow this has escalated
most of us have lived in florida for or more years before deasshole was elected not so easy to up and move we just need to get rid of him and find an ethical politician
someone file a complaint in florida about trumps son posting a picture of the judges daughter
obviously yes i follow rebekah have read the thread what has been done to her son is straight up fascistic illegal and evil essentially her year old son posted a meme on snapchat and it wound up being reported to authorities leading to dcf taking him from the home here is the meme https://preview.redd.it/q6nzd7rij9sa1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=42c4156682ab59cd9d75e0bf36184094220de6d0 rebekah is a whistleblower she reported that the state of fl tampered with covid data everyone needs to know what s happening in florida take action however you can
she s not even a political opponent she s a data scientist she refused to curtail covid data like gov desantis requested she was fired as a result but she built her own website and posted the data there however she was getting the data from systems she should not have had access to after being fired fl state troopers raided her house and said she was hacking a government network but all she did was use her username and password from before she was fired but get this they only used username and password for everyone that worked there essentially the florida government is stealing software licenses but she s the one in trouble for remembering the credentials they never changed
desantis is a fascist period little d energy wanna be dictator weaponizing the office for political bs
no but you see it s only bad to arrest political opponents if the political opponent is lord saviour jesus trump s
florida is a desantis police state and it has been for awhile
something about refreshing the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants
how is mocking the cops for being fat and lazy in a private message terrorism it s not like the kid called for the death of cops it s literally mocking them for sitting by and doing nothing while a shooter is rampaging in a school i guess it s possible there s a message about doing something that she hasn t showed either way that seems a far stretch to arrest someone on felony charges i d think you would have to wait for them to text actual plans of commiting harm to cops before arresting him with gerrymandering in full effect a lot of the bible belt states are going down a dangerous path
i truly hope desantis s balls spontaneously combust
everyone from florida up in this thread if you feel like you don t have anything to lose get on twitter and start posting the same fucking meme spam that shit tag desantis prove these charges are trumped up bullshit because no way any regular person is getting arrested over this
there will be no peace in the usa as long as the republican party exists this is why you don t give nazis the benefit of the doubt and you don t pretend that they re justy like any other peaceful political group especially since they don t actually have any policy beyond persecute everyone else because this is what happens when you do you don t welcome nazis in politics for the same reason that you don t ask cancer s opinion before removing tumors
what the absolute fuck how can i support this lawsuit faster
is this the woman who they came after before because she was accurately updating the covid statistics
removed
sounds like something desantis and his supporters would do they re pure evil
as a german i can t say i d be surprised the republicans have done lots of stuff straight from the nsdap rulebook recently looks like y all are in for a ride
maybe now that these fascists are coming after white kids someone will stop him
feds fucking do something for the love of god
funny how conservatives whine about being canceled for disagreeing with the woke agenda and now we see that republicans are literally willing to arrest you for making fun of them they arrested a child for making a joke about them
you can expect a lot more of this behaviour from president desantis desantis sent a police raid to a fired employee s house for reporting covid data because it didn t align with his claim covid was no big deal he s so angry disney defied him on don t say gay that he added millions of dollars in tax burdens to his own citizens in order to puniish disney so we know collateral damage is okay with desantis you can also expect him to switch behaviours right before the next election relying on our short term memories to forget shit like this it s very important to continue to talk about it he will rule with an iron fist sending opponents to jail ordering raids and irs harassment and apparently kidnapping and abusing cps are also on the table he will either roll over for putin like trump did or order an all out war against him who even knows he s so violatile desantis will be a disaster for the united states
my guess is that since desantis lost with disney he is attempting to attack them by going after disney s base
is this the same women desantis had raided because she refused to lie about floridas covid numbers
getting chills imagining this guy as president dude needs to kick rocks
jesus this is what actual political persecution looks like
and yet of the americans go aww this is the best country in the world so amazing the people are amazing its sooooo amazing
just like the nazis literally if you are a cop or judge taking part in this you are making your an accessory and should go to jail
mentally ill person writes that they will do a school shooting i slep kid of political opponent shares a meme real shit
desantis is nazi the republican party is nazis some of us have been warning everyone since bush that this is where the republican party was going yet still today people will call those of us who tried to warn you as hysterical or say we re overreacting
fucking fascists the current republican party disgusts me and i was a member until trump all blue all the time now never going back
come on joe send in the us marshalls protect democracy
yikes desatan is following putin and xi s playbook
the fuck i pray this isn t true and if it is perhaps a bunch of moms need to form a gang and go save this kid and any others dealing with this crap who s in
freedom of speech my ass
this is the florida dept of health lady that was arrested because she said she was trying to get the truth out about covid in florida
authoritarian governments and some fools vote for them under the assumption they will hurt the right people not them
damn digital stasi as german i m impressed florida is so hard being a mix of both evil parts of the ddr and nazi germany and the best thing is many other states see this as absolute freedom and try to follow foot i know it s hard but i always want you guys to run from the usa it s a christian sharia and nazis in one spot supported by capitalist totalitarians that stand above the law
tmi i live in florida with my husband and we are gay gay gay and we ve had hot sweaty gay sex all over ron desantis state gay gay gay and ron desantis can go fuck himself with a hot curling iron
i smell a federal civil rights suit maybe also a kidnapping case i m not a lawyer but it looks like florida is violating federal law
and which side is it that constantly makes memes about how dems are gonna arrest people for memes
reminder fyi for anyone who didn t know rebekah jones made national headlines during the pandemic for refusing to falsify florida s covid statistics she s not a political opponent she s a dedicated public servant who refused to commit fraud for emperor ron s regime
is this the rights first strike since their fat orange savior got arrested
this is exactly why i can t stand tx and fl they are so republican that they are taking away freedoms and think they are becoming more free now tx is going to have the commandments on at every public school the republican party is absolutely terrifying
ok seriously at what point does the federal government go what the fuck are you doing because all this coming out of florida is making my hair stand on end
a yes jokes about cops being fat and lazy are terrorism and since i ve typed this on my cellphone ronda sandtits can spy on me and kidnap me too come get me you round carl wheezer looking motherfucker you kidnap this year old to get him drunk too
welcome to america s next president folks ain t nothing gonna whip up the right with good feels like some old fashioned iron fisted authoritarianism
actual fascism
wow they are just blatantly being fascist right out in the open for everyone to see scary
florida is a fascist state there are several other states currently moving towards fascism this is reality in we can t ignore this shit anymore
reminder for anyone who s forgotten that rebekah jones became desantis political opponent by publishing florida s covid statistics at a time when the governor had ordered medical officials to keep those statistics censored because he didn t want anyone to realize that florida was actually dealing with really high covid rates at the time jones has previously claimed that her house was raided over this particular action that she d taken so apparently now desantis is drumming up stupid excuses to kidnap her children real upstanding politician shit
can floridians claim asylum in other states
welcome to russian florida what s happening in red states is exactly how the past years in russia unfolded
police so fucking salty about being bitches they re arresting kids sharing memes making fun of them being inept
small government amirite
i hate it here
the decent people in this country need to come to terms with the fact that these fascists are not playing
this better be fake i am tired of stuff not being fake those red hatted bastards promised me fake news
funny how it s always the people that say they ll come after normal citizens if we don t act who are the ones that come after normal citizens
stand up america
why can biden do nothing about the fact that florida is running on facism aren t their protections for whistle blowers at this point desantis is a casual state funded human trafficker isn t that a felony
fascism is here folks wake up
republicans and their love of fucking underage people seriously this is quite orwellian
now just if nascar and walmart would support gay pride they would have nothing left to do other than hold trailerpark circle jerks
all we need to do is get a couple of gun manufacturers to support anything remotely woke and we could get some gun control
when you add truck nuts to your truck and your truck didn t come with nuts does that make it trans
if they boycott f150s won t they have to boycott neckbeards and drugstore sunglasses too
they like rams better anyway
nice i didn t know about the f150 too this is only gonna get funnier
if only nascar had a rainbow warrior
nascar went woke a year or two ago and they already already did their boycott just like they did with the nfl

good luck with that they re the ones paying republicans not to inact any gun control the only way you get gun control is by voting out the r s
i mean people refer to cars and trucks as she so
leave drug store sunglasses out of this
with a brand name like rams they could come up with some very interesting pride campaigns
when i was a kid i fucking loved jeff gordon we didn t have cable so my step dad s boss would film it for us and we would watch it on vhs i remember they were teaching us about the stock market in like fucking 3rd grade or something and we had teams i was so caught up in it the team let me name us the rainbow warriors and i remember cringing a bit when they announced it over the intercom at school our rankings compared to everyone else we even invested in some nascar related stock i loved that shit at the time
rip nascar and the nfl
rainbow colored pride pew pews boom just opened up a whole new market of course they d go for that they tell the lawmakers what to do anyway not the other way around
oh hell yeah
he ll end up tweeting from a cave at this rate
shouldnt he be mad at the bible to there is a rainbow in of the early stories
i see grindr there and love the idea that in gay dating app the rainbow in logo is what crosses the line
if he wants to boycott all of them he should only eat stuff out of his own garden and tailor his own clothes
all fear the terrible rainbow flee for its masculinity draining powers no man can withstand apparently
matt walsh needs to be boycotted
_are we the baddies _
i mean did the grindr one need to be rainbow
anheuser busch marketing teams are trolling right now busch light fishing cans and rainbow bud lights

anybody know what the logo 3rd from the bottom and 3rd from the right is looks like two semicircles
they say to distract a brownie one need only spill a container of sugar or salt and the fae is bound to stoop and count each grain
lmao isn t one of those the grindr logo
this is hilarious seriously what are all these republicans gonna do if everyone puts rainbows on their logos are they gonna boycott everything until nothing is left lol
reddit devs it s time to shine rainbow reddit forever
fight the fascist fight matt your time will be wasted no matter what you do with it because you re a thoroughly worthless human being fuck you inside out and sideways
wow i was just making this exact point to my wife yesterday so we re having a laugh about seeing someone else thinking the same thing
i wonder how many firearms manufacturers also support the lgbt community
boycott the rain the main source of all rainbows
pretty soon they ll have to survive only on chick fil a jelly belly jelly beans and whatever they can scrounge at the hobby lobby
if he had a brain it would seriously explode
lol this is great i actually hope they start trying to boycott everything and eventually find out they are just complete losers that cannot create culture except for hate
it would be so easy to make an ai generate thousands of real looking pride corporatw logos we just sprinkle in enough real ones we might be able to make walsh give up on life
if you really wanna keep matt walsh busy give him some finger paint maybe a nice sensory board
their support is only a marketing ploy
now somebody photoshop a pride fox logo and everyone just pretend it s legit this is the only way
i mean twitter is on there or does it not count if it s pre elon twitter
with a box of scraps
nah that s fine that was before the gays stole the rainbow with their gay agenda
god invented it to remind him not to kill all humans again because otherwise he in his omniscience might forget and whoops honestly gay people rehabilitated it considerably by adopting it
too friendly grammer ocd checking in
i feel like that one was kind of a gimme still i feel more comfortable now that i know matt walsh will have to boycott it
don t be silly a guy like him would never tailor his own clothes it s women s work
but what if he buys the seeds and gardening implements from a woke company
wow you figured out how capitalism works bravo
it really is all just marketing if it was more profitable to discriminate they d be doing that instead
yeah matt is a shill best ignored when possible
hm yes its as if these companies want to make a profit and that social issues aren t really of concern to them hmm never heard that before
empower fingal came up in an online search i don t think i am allowed to post the link
even if it doesn t i m sure microsoft apple and android have done pride logos i guess he can always do a parler from his linux although not sure what search engine he d use
sounds like the safest bet gotta make sure they don t support pride by using their apple or android or windows or linux or any other device that may have hardware made in usa
i still find it funny that you can steal a rainbow from an all powerful all knowing and all seeing god
no lie he just put out a video bragging about how he doesn t even know how to use a washing machine imagine thinking that a guy who can t figure out a simple household appliance would be worthy to opine on anything important
silly me
i appreciate the effort lol
and god placed his bow in the sky to let us all know he wouldn t try to kill us all again again and then ru paul plucked the bow from heaven to direct the world destroying yet fabulous weapon at the straight white americans as it is written in the gayble
can god make a gay so powerful that even he can t beat them
good ol boys punching the air right now
it s their favorite mode of trans portation
i can t believe there has not been a tiktok channel started yet of someone being a truck veterinarian that goes around neutering trucks by cutting these plastic scrotums off of trucks in parking lots to help control the population of dumb rednecks
someone start printing trans trucks for trump stickers to slap on those rigs personally i m hanging a fleshlight off the back of my truck we ll see where that goes
she has a very good point
i don t need a trans truck but i wouldn t mind a trans am
maga is all about cisportation
everyone knows vehicles are a she
lol its funny she s got quotes around the whole tweet that way in case it turns out to be a miscalculation offensive she can be like i was just quoting what someone else said
i dont think anyone saw that and said got me
if you add balls it doesn t change the truck it s still a truck
yeah i saw that stand bit too
buh dum che
don t let memes be dreams
that would be a constant stream of vandalism which might be problematic
be careful in texas they just outlawed them
really
i would give you an award but alas i am poor
but you identify the truck as male so you had to affirm its gender by giving it balls
she forgot about the part where the guy says you call that truck with nuts she try to tell me you don t understand pronouns you just red necked yourself into being progressive
you disagree i guess you have a set of fake balls hanging from your truck it s all good
i felt this in my soul
this is a preview of the rest of this century hysterical white trash burning this country to the ground before allowing a seat at the table for anyone else i am so utterly fucking ashamed of this shithole white trash country gerrymandered to hell and back just to make the genetic and cultural dregs of the white race feel safe an impossible goal under any circumstances
they wouldn t get it even were they open to new information which they are not
can you show us on the doll where their free speech touched you
how can this stand wouldn t the state supreme court rule this violates the first amendment
republicans aren t confused what fascism is they know what they are doing
i ve got some bad news about tn s supreme court justices all five are super conservative and appointed by republican governors they were probably cheering along
there has to be a way to prevent representatives from being expelled for representing their constituents lawsuits tn supreme court can t allow this i m hours away from nashville and my weekend is free
you re looking at this all wrong they expelled the men but kept the woman they are feminists
but we re not racist s there used to be an old saying actions speak louder than words apparently that doesn t apply to white people in tennessee
i can t qwhite put my finger on it rep johnson
there needs to be protest immediately of greater magnitude they just took away representation from thousands of people in as little as a week this is scary
republicans are the worst trash in the government and they re actively steering into the iceberg
wwgsd what would general sherman do
keep it classy tennessee your friend mississippi
this is a disgrace my republican ancestors did not slay tens of thousands of racist democrats to have their party be ran like this we need reform among many many others
tell me why this is the first topic or news headline ive seen that points this out
about years ago i was working for a company and a coworker died unexpectedly he was a young guy with a wife and young kids it was terrible the company held a conference call for our department and said they would be covering his funeral expenses because we were a family and family is always there for one another days later they held another conference call and laid half of us off
the culture of the people whom constantly clear their throats like they came to work off a three day coke bender
man i don t miss this at all
it s still like working remotely but with extra steps
did someone say family gif giphy xvposmmzt60xzv31my
managers who need to see you to manage you are crappy managers
perfect high walls ftw fuck that low wall shit
my company is fully remote and it s the best company culture i ve ever been a part of
family is always there for one another and you re not part of it any longer
amen afuckingmen
oh man i went to a job interview once where there were no walls at all just tiny desks in a grid on an open floor with managers stalking between them peeking over everybody s shoulders got the f k out of there and didn t look back
your father and i are getting a divorce from you neither of us love you anymore
mom

it s definitely fascism but i never thought fascism would actually look like a bunch of overgrown babies throwing their weight around like this
what will it take for the federal government ag garland to act in addition to the weakened but still there laws protecting access to voting the constitution in the guarantee clause article iv section provides support for such an action minority rule in states is unconstitutional and that is what the republicans have been reduced to they must be stopped from constitutioncenter org https://constitutioncenter.org),: the guarantee clause requires the united states to guarantee to the states a republican form of government and provide protection from foreign invasion and domestic violence although rarely formally invoked by congress the president or the courts there is some consensus on what it means at its core the guarantee clause provides for majority rule a republican government is one in which the people govern through elections this is the constant refrain of the federalist papers alexander hamilton for example put it this way in the federalist no http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed57.asp): the elective mode of obtaining rulers is the characteristic policy of republican government thus the guarantee clause imposes limitations on the type of government a state may have the clause requires the united states to prevent any state from imposing rule by monarchy dictatorship aristocracy or permanent military rule even through majority vote instead governing by electoral processes is constitutionally required
imagine switching to the gop at this point in time no actual democrat would do that she was already a republican
this is what recalls are for
so just fuck all the democratic voters who gave you a job right fuck this bitch if you want to switch party affiliation there should be a new election for your seat how is this behavior even remotely permissible
so between january and april she all of a sudden decided that she can no longer be a democrat it should not be legal for an elected official to change parties while in office she committed fraud when she took democratic party election money when she knew she wasn t going to remain in the democratic party she also defrauded voters who supported her
i mean tulsi gabbard exists
what a grand life altering revelation she had after checks notes months yup doesn t sound calculated or insincere at all says she ll immediately fall into the woke is blah blah blah talking points because of course she will
her constituents should protest in front of her home night an day she should have no peace
since most voters vote for a party not the person switching parties should be an immediate re election
what a republican lied to get elected
just fucking why it s unlikely republicans will want to vote for a former democrat and she just alienated all the people who gave her the job to begin with she will never win another election she ended her political career so i hope those bribes she took were worth it
check her bank account
she should be sued for the return of any and all campaign contributions she is a typical republican criminal this is how they roll
five ll get you ten if you do some digging her campaign war chest will be noticeably heavier after she changed parties all from anonymous or grass roots donors of course
she s banging republikkklan tim moore and she has been paid a lot of money to switch
i registered as independent way back in highschool when i still thought both sides had fair points when i realized that meant i couldn t actually vote in the primaries and i learned that is because of republican voter suppression i tried to switch to democrat still couldn t vote in that years primaries how the fuck can an elected official just hop parties when i as a voter had to make a near permanent decision at years old
this is why in australia you don t vote for the person you vote for the party you wanna switch sides go for it don t let the door hit you on the ass on the way out though we don t want loser ass prints on our winner s club door
sinema i truly can never fathom becoming a republican i hope my loved ones would know that i was possessed and do something about it rather than let me live with an r on my voter s card
she did a sinema expect this to be the norm not the exception in the future
is this happening more and more recently there is that az senator sinema as well tulsi gabbard was another case are they infiltrating the democrats from within when they can t defeat us in the elections anymore
legislative office n salisbury street rm raleigh nc mailing address n salisbury street rm raleigh nc main phone member s email tricia cotham ncleg gov
she got bought
further proof republicans have no morals or values just an insatiable greed for power and the emotional maturity of a two year old wah they said means words to me now i m a racist and bigot but don t you dare call me on it
the thing about our party is that we don t fight dirty and while i normally hate fighting dirty we can t continue to just sit back find the skeleton s in her closet now
c t
has become it took this miserable dishonest person months to accept money and change parties lock her up
on the bright side they re showing us all the things that need fixing
it s actually the other way around repubs are unrecognizable member party of law and order
our government relies so much on the assumption that elected officials will be responsible adults with a sense of duty founders couldn t have imagined the scumbag shit republicans are up to now
it happens a lot more with republicans but this person has conflagrated the power of her district with her own personal power and is one of the greatest failings of the representative democracy system used in the us
hey a fun thought experiment what would have happened if she went from republican to democrat let s say in texas
bastard gif giphy 3o7wtvfmt8f77fth9c
interesting tidbit she is pro choice and has had an abortion
see you next tuesday
this will happen more saboteurs will be weeded out
for directly lying to the people who voted her into office she should face criminal charges for treason
did her moral pendulum suddenly swing all the way in the opposite direction i mean why not just switch to be independent seems like that would be less alienating and insulting to the voters that hired you
this should be illegal she should not be allowed to get away with lying to everyone who voted for her how much more insidious can republicans get
she was elected as a democrat many times previously https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tricia_cotham and lost so this wasn t something where she came out of nowhere ran and switched like it was part of some new fangled gotcha thing she served as a democrat for years
recall recall recall
if what she said is true she would have switched to an independent
c u next tuesday
right after the switch yesterday nc republicans introduced bills targeting trans youth from sports participation bills to banning puberty blockers
how d she get elected in the first place if all her policies and beliefs didn t reflect the party i get she can just lie about everything of course but why would the party also push her through seems like a failing of constituents as well
my state rep jeff vandrew did the same shit a few years back such a scumbag move
hopefully this does not hurt democratic voting too much they need to vote even more than republicans to win over those gerrymandered districts and you can bet the crazy old and unemployed republicans will vote for sure a bit damatised but you get it
well i mean sinema did this in the senate and is going to be primaried out in only way she stays in congress is if the gop makes her the nom which is unlikely but you never know
republicans are evil they do any dirty tricks to gain power just like nazis
they need to recall her
i think she lied despicable dirty trick
i m pretty sure it s the latter also she s been boinking her repug colleague nc house speaker tim moore
wait which party has become unrecognizable the fuck
so she decided she is a fascist and is against women and children okay she was never a democrat she was a wolf in sheep s clothing they will vote her out next term
she felt bullied by democrats and wanted to switch to a party that felt more welcoming bruh trump is literally the biggest bully i ve ever seen also you re trying to claim that the republicans the lgbtq hating take women s rights away mexican loathing fear mongering republicans are the more welcoming party what a joke
a snake and proud of it describes what i m seeing here
i m guessing she s getting a fat lobbyist job after this she s probably already taking bribes i would investigate the shit out of her for corruption
i m confused why this is even legal
tricia corham traitor to democracy
let s go back in time tar and feathers comes to mind
i m conservative and republican and this should warrant a special election to see if they would still get elected they ran on false information and should be held accountable i have no problem with people switching sides it happens all the time but as an elected official that s not the reason you were elected so you should have to win another election
what a politician being a lying and manipulative operator i m truly shocked
the gop has normalized lying and the dems are just sitting on their asses watching the show
it should count as fraud against everyone that voted for her
i think if you switch parties after being elected you should have to rerun for your seat
can t they recall her i would get the ball rolling asap despicable person changing to the side of evil
you trying to summon guillotines because that s how you end up with guillotines
recall her and void the results her constituents have that power
jesus christ what a bitch
she should be stripped of office and there should be a new election putting her on gop ballots against gop candidates this trojan horse shit shouldn t be normalized or does this happen more than i think
they shouldn t be allowed to do this
lied to get the job seems like a common narrative these days
how did our government get this fucked up and how do we fix it at this point i m reviewing all options to leave the country
imagine running as a democrat in a democrat leaning district only to switch over an vote republican months after being elected that s fraud
well professional liar republican
you do realize democrats use to be more moderate right there was a time within the last years where republicans and democrats were willing to compromise
i may get banned for saying this but this is a riotable offense
at what point can her district sue her for fraud or cause a recall biden won that district by points and this person obviously does not represent their interests
we re watching our whole entire system crumble there s no honor or integrity anymore it s power and greed
her explanation for leaving the democratic party doesn t explain joining the gop she s a liar
sure would be nice if there were consequences for shit like this but it seems republicans are allowed to do whatever they want with no repercussions ever
i m going to follow up with a third option she was given so much money and promised power and protection to switch
politicians are known to lie but the public should hold them accountable if they are found out they either should be removed immediately or by the next public vote
as a rule of thumb i don t trust people with dead eyes
this is election fraud period there should be consequences for this transparent bullshit
she assumed the office the beginning of this year there has been no change in the parties since then i believe she wants the wonderful enrichment being a republican tool will bring
the modern day democrat aka the one that s different from months ago when she got elected
intrepid infiltrator she ll get a handsome reward from the gop and other traitors
how is it even possible to get elected for one party and then just switch party doesn t that mean they should have to be elected again for that party
like desantis she will not resign nor will republicans launch an investigation into her democrats need to do the leg work to point out how illegal this is an we need to agree that we will not accept the laws put forward by criminals
i was led to believe that politicians are supposed to speak for the constituents the people they voted her in with the belief that she would vote one way but now she is going to vote the opposite way due to teenage butthurt feelings tough luck lady you have one job and that is to listen to the citizens of your district imagine i got hired at kfc but decided that i was a vegan and that everyone else should be a vegan and i refused to work with chicken i would be fired
you shouldn t be allowed to switch parties what is wrong these politicians these days me me me they are supposed to be an extension of their constituents not a singular operating individual switching parties is a direct violation of the trust of the voters that put her in that place of government something needs to be put on the books to stop these ridiculous actions if a politician wants to switch sides fine but you ll have to vacate your current position and run again for the other party the vacated position should have a special election of same party candidates to replace that person case closed
sick of both parties can we please have more parties it s like watching mommy and daddy fight and we just want peace
that jewelry is the first sign that she s republican
a politician switching parties should be forced to give up their elected position she was elected as a democrat and now no longer holds the beliefs that her constituents elected her for
stop electing people with wonky eyes this weirdo mtg boebert gaetz huckabee sanders the list goes on and on look at the candidate if they look like they ate paint chips as a child throw your vote elsewhere
i m assuming it was recognizable until she was elected
there needs to be automatic disqualification or expulsion from certain government positions when it comes to these things acts such as corruption bribery federal crimes etc the constitution relied on people acting in good faith and republicans have completely given that up
keep voting guys vote real hard
on april cotham formally announced her departure from the democratic party and joined the republican party giving the latter a veto proof majority allowing them to pass bills without negotiating with the democratic governor she claimed the reasons she was leaving were her fellow democrats blasting me on twitter to calling me names coming after my family coming after my children that is wrong in one article she is quoted as claiming the turning point was the hounding of her using the american flag on social media and on her vehicles in another article she is quoted as claiming she felt bullied by democrats and wanted to switch to a party that felt more welcoming from the wiki
or the gop found her price
that is republican hair
i see what ya did there well played
groomers all of them
for superiority

appointed for life positions are a bad idea in general imo of couse
well you answered it right there didn t ya any decent justice would resign doesn t apply to seor fuckface over here
any decent justice would resign any decent body of congress would impeach thomas yeah about that decent bit it s gonna be a tough one
impeachment has to start at the house so i m pretty sure the republicans are going to get right on this s
that means they re now also going to court over bribery right
this is pubic hairs on coke cans for his female staff guy right
is there a tax issue here you have to declare gifts over a certain amount right capone his ass
so anytime they say george soros we say harlan crow you know the guy that bought the scotus
and absolutely nothing will come of this
gif giphy ltb6fky1fmazhhv1en
i live in dallas i ve done work in many of the crow family buildings to say they re loaded is a massive understatement one of the apartments had a roof hot tub glass bottom mannequins in outfits indian chief superhero and something else for the ladies i heard one home has a massive underground area massive also a secret room of hitler watercolors lots of truly amazing art
it s cute that you think he might be decent
clarence thomas is by all available evidence the most egregiously corrupt and dishonest supreme court justice in american history
its crazy how much of this is happening right under our noses especially between wall street and our politicians the highest office in the us treasury has made 10x her yearly salary by doing speeches at conferences for the big wall street banks like goldman sachs we really need to wash out the rampant corruption in our government
obviously none of that money went to makeovers
conflict of interest much
lavish gifts is a strange way to spell bribes
bribery is actually a form of free speech
if there s anything i ve learned recently it s that any attempt to hold corrupt politicians accountable only makes them huddle to protect the accused
sadly he is not decent nor is congress
i worky for a company that does contract work for the government we have ethics training every year according to it i m not allowed to gift a government worker anything above dollars even if it s for christmas birthday etc anything above dollars will risk me getting fired or barred from the industry just wanted to put in perspective how much is compared to the official bucks max
absolutely nothing will come of this
absolutely nothing will come of this revolution the judge and congress will simply ignore it and it will go away so very sad
this isn t a revelation they all do it scalia was on one such trip when he died
party of grifters
i m sure they are not alone i for one say clean house of any and all who do this get the money out of politics hell pay them minimum wage or less then we d see people who actually want to be there
hahaha decent we know he is not decent
the republicans are cancer
has he ruled on anything that donor would benefit from
republicans dont have any decency left i use to respect thier opinion on certain things i use to agree with them but this cult that is now the republican party is so corupt hateful and anti american i will never support them again or even listen to their opinion until they startr living in truth facts decency so becsically i will never support them since they will never change until we vote them all out
they won t
they re all crooks and it s all a scam
harlan crow sounds like the villain from season of justified
just one more reason the current supreme court cannot be taken seriously dig a little deeper and you ll probably find the other fascists on the court have been taking bribes too this court is bought and paid for bet on it
might matter if the scotus had a code of ethics
not surprised rl clayton bigsby is corrupt
can we stop using breaking for everything i m getting really sick of that shit
donor
how cute she sold him in to slavery
and nothing will happen
unfortunately nothing will happen
thomas and crow are buddies it is the same as if my friend invited me to his lake house for the weekend
long dong silver away
he needs to be removed from the bench immediately and all decisions decided by one vote in his direction need to be reviewed after he is replaced of course
time to have justices
they both looks like umbridge
crow should be investigated also this is clearly a way to bribe a judge
we re talking about the us government decency was strangled quite some time ago
the republicans when asked about it will pause for a minute and then say what about hunter s laptop
scumbags
at all of my jobs in retail and in investment companies they make me sign saying i can t except gifts in value over but this guy gets million dollar vacations for twenty years fuck this guy make america fair
ianacpa but i would venture a guess there are tax implications for gifts such as these and perhaps some sort of perjury charges for knowingly signing an incorrect tax return
look at how the greeks did it public yet anonymous democratic voting with a literal counting mechanism and tokens that couldn t be forged and those who somehow managed to cheat were exiled anyone who spoke out against the democracy or wanted to replace democracy with another system was also exiled as well as everyone had an equal opportunity to have any position for years before resigning these people were also exempt from being voted into that particular position for years to prevent corruption etc
even jefferson said so
it only looks good on paper
it s the correct opinion they abused the privilege and it should be taken away
when the founding fathers decided on lifetime appointments it was to free the justices of political influence at that time the scotus held court at the state in question and you traveled there by horses this wasn t a cushy gig by any means and those who did it did so out of a call to service no justice wanted to do it until they died now it is a hyper partisan position with no accountability to voters and a guaranteed job until death getting on the bench is a fool proof means to permanently enrich yourself as with most things constitutional the founders intent has been perverted by the modern political system
you don t have to be so focused any conservative republican judge will not resign
it s a real fundamental flaw with american government we have all the tools necessary to remove these bad actors but it falls apart when a party will protect their own regardless of how horrible their actions are and the voters support this
i ll hold my breath until the proceedings start s
yup
wtf how did i not hear about this one
my first thought as well capone his ass
unless we the people are willing to punish them ourselves nope
if you pay minimum wage then only rich people can afford to do the job
theres holes there for todays society but not a bad framework at all
good to know you dont happen to have links to the hidtory do you i mean i know how to use google but i appreciate anything you can point me to
the framework is rarely the problem it s usually the human factor that makes it bad
best way to look it up is google scotus term lengths the first justices only serve a few years it isn t until later when the court is centralized that we see terms extend like the first chief justice john jay served from to years oliver ellsworth was like years as chief by comparison courts in the 1900s onward last more like years john roberts the current chief justice has served since years and is only so could as the justices do serve another years until his 80s
it s always the problem american government works fantastic it s the idiots who exploit the holes who ruin it
tech businesses should put their money where their mouth is and move out of that racist shithole state
being 40th in education probably explains why so many texans think seceding is a good idea
as an it person i d rather live in afghanistan or anywhere else but ted town
texas is wherr i got me mah edumucation
gonna be real funny when that influx of people getting jobs flips the demographics and puts sen cancun out of a job
texas would be the last place i think when i would need people to run high tech businesses overall i know some cities would be good but overall no been here all my life if this were true then why s everything big tech in cali and not here

to be fair some of the new chromebook colors are pretty festive this is the hard hitting journalism this country needs now
just so we re crystal fucking clear all those networks saying trump is under arrest are not on our side at all they are billionaire owned and playing their side role but none of them are reporting on the protests going on in germany or france because they aren t on our side turn all legacy media off
komo seattle in particular is a sinclair station that s all about pushing the conservative agenda
is homophobia going to eradicate alcoholism within rural communities
they are shoving it down our throats take it like a mannn
it s hilarious to see them destroy stuff they already paid for
please tell me this is real
lgbt spending is huge all the major brands come out and support pride week
at this rate republicans will only be left with my pillow brand bourbon
after all they re a bunch of gif giphy 6ailwjpuzyblmr22ox

go woke go broke nah more like figure out that real people are tolerant and there s much more money in marketing to gay and gay friendly people than broke homophobes
they re gonna be drinking medicinal alcohol by summer
just imagine how utterly miserable someones existence has to be for this to get them upset like just stop and think if a commercial sticker or something sends them into such a fit of rage they destroy there own property or change there years long habit and they say drag queens are the mentally unstable
tennesse home of the drag glamp also respect to jd
dang we are going to have fewer conservative alcoholics if this keeps up coors bud and now jd odds they start drinking bleach drain o or paint thinner
let s get gun brands to do it

yas this is what i was hoping
i agree with him this one the torment i mean look at these men i m a woman and i feel so unfabulous knowing such fabulous people exist drag on gif giphy wlm2im9clvkge
so based on the methodology of the right to boycott kid rock a concert i wouldn t have seen regardless i should buy tickets and burn them i m not going to do that i m just not going to go as originally planned
must be pretty exhausting being a fucking right wing snowflake
john deere has always been tough reliable honest just like the farmers who use our tractors but now we re also sasssssy introducing a new line of tractors painted entirely in pinks purples or our premium matte rainbow onboard radio comes preinstalled with the entire madonna catalogue dozens of other optional features including seat warmers gps prosecco bar
on the upside if enough of the big alcohol companies show pride support they could possibly force right wingers to start agreeing with those politics helping our nation become vaguely functional it s a long shot but technically possible
brand wants to expand towards the younger and more liberal audience it pushes cultural hot button avalanche of conservative outrage follows with some super stupid examples of overreaction and grievances against the brand and the phenomenon liberals get the message that the brand is on their side profit
it s almost like conservatives don t understand capitalism
all these booze companies going woke is really messing with my sobriety
from what i ve seen it s bud lite coors and now jack daniel s please if anyone knows any more please let me know
maybe i ll be able to actually get some of the rare jd releases now i want a bottle of coy hill i mean i m not but i can hope
the bigots will have to start their own brand preferably with wood alcohol
now we just need some ar15 producers to have lgbtq advertisements and maybe the gun control will happen xd
cheers to the first gun manufacturer that makes a pride edition to a rifle
drag gun clubs let s gooooo
could we get smith and wesson to hire some drag queens to help promote guns
yaaasss love me some jack fire
as an experiment to find out if they can be desensitized we should have a new brand every day at what point does it no longer trigger them when will they actually be cured
i think my favorite part is that despite the right s get woke go broke nonsense exactly zero of the companies who have gotten woke have gone broke d
i don t even like most tennessee whiskeys but i know what i m ordering my next old fashioned with
so the rednecks have to give up budweiser and jack no more yee no more haw
this is a good way to get them off alcohol though lol
granted corporations cannot be trusted they are not friends or allies and for the most part are your enemies but it is heartening that the soulless amoral pschos they have doing the money math see no future in maga morons
i d love for ford to do this of people that drive f150 pickups are road bully assholes i d love to have less on the roads
this republican gqp boycott of bud lite and jack daniels should be just as effective and devastating as their boycott of carhartt walmart netflix previous budweiser boycott starbucks oreos keurig target yeti pepsi gillette nordstrom the nfl the mlb the nba nascar nike univision macy s cnn hbo airbnb allstate espn footlocker gofundme lowe s home depot ihop johnson johnson levi strauss rip all those companies that are no more because of gqp boycotts
fox news and qanon were used as psy ops to attack america now we use trans advertisements psy ops to fight back amazingly the rainbows on the beer cans have been very effective as a psychological weapon
this is so funny to me all they going to have left to drink is natty light lol
this is great
love this
pretty soon all they ll have left is zima and white claw
eventually they ll have nothing which is more than most of them deserve nothing

i absolutely love how these thundercnuts are getting all upset over this i can seeca few strokes and heart attacks in their future
i don t drink but maybe i will stock up anyway
looks like republicans will be sober in the future first bud light now this i mean water had no campaign with a drag trans person it s healthier anyway
maybe if they all have to stop drinking they ll come to their senses wishful thinking anyway
i ll start buying that swill i won t drink it though
it s absolutely amazing to me how intimidated and threatened grown adults feel at the idea of a man dressing up like a woman like there s serious shit going in the world and they re having moral panic attacks because someone is wearing a dress a wig and makeup
i mean how loud does the whole world around you have to be screaming it for you to realize you re on the complete wrong side of history these fuckers are the new version of the shitheads hurling insults and spitting at little black girls trying to go to school go look at those pictures do those assholes look like brave patriots no they look like hateful ignorant fuckheads who history is proud to have steamrolled over these gqp anti woke whatever the fuck that means are so unbelievably fragile and pathetic once again they need history to just unapologetically streamroll right over them and leave them in the dust
oh boy this is gonna be the funniest shit ever
thought it was a stormy daniel jack daniels and ru paul drag race triple threat i m somewhat whelmed but kudos nonetheless ah maybe next time though
it s all the brands i don t like though when is sam adam s gonna join in i don t want people thinking i m a crazy hater just because i think bud lite is piss lol
it s the time of the season for alcohol companies to piss off homophobes seriously have they forgotten that they try to advertise to every possible customer the lgbtq community is no different especially when pride month in june isn t that far off
do guns next
all this advertising money spent doesn t change all the money spent on politicians enacting anti lgbt legislation i guess performative baby steps will do for now
so wait i m confused is cancel culture good or bad because i thought the conservatives said cancel culture was bad yet here we are
now unlike bud lite i can see lgtbqia people drinking jack daniels because it is delicious honey whiskey so good
they should start doing guns
god jack is terrible whiskey but now i need to buy a bottle
at least they still have their keystone light
well if they boycott jack daniels coors and bud light maybe they ll get sober for once or at least get better tastes in alcohol
come on big alcohol this is going to get weed legal at a federal level if you keep this up
curing alcoholism one brand at a time
how dumb do they have to be not to realize small local breweries who don t participate in politics is the obvious solution they just keep corporate d hopping and experiencing a gayer and gayer existence along the way
imagine these people sober kinda scary
this reminds me of the non binary buffalo in ridley jones just look at it and laugh knowing that someone somewhere is absolutely losing their mind about it lol
well i guess the maga crowd is gonna have to go to meth and opioids gotta numb the pain somehow
there goes whiskey pretty soon if they want to stick to their principal there will be no alcohol for them to drink good these incels and suburban mums sure are gonna be happy incels already no more beer and whiskey let s do white wine now
the people who have a problem with this clearly don t realize that us gays will certainly make up for the loss of alcohol sales for them and then some
i mean this is great but i absolutely fucking hate that they didn t close the quote small town big pride campaign
can t wait to see the kid rock machine gun video of this one do you think he will cry this time
i can see them calling for prohibition
wow first their beer and now their whiskey everything is going woke and subsequently broke i m told whatever shall the free market do
trump spirits coming to a bankruptcy near you
if enough products team up with drag queens and trans people conservatives will starve to death
and it isn t even june
it took me longer than it should have to read ru instead of rand but it makes sense now
what are they gonna do get sober
the stupid part is that you could grift them right now if you just put out a swill beer that just had a confederate flag on it profit for days
i stopped drinking jack daniels because of this hur durr s
i love watching their meltdowns this makes me want to buy jack daniels
it s just comical at this point pouring jack down the drain blowing up bud light cans throwing away checks notes tampax when will these idiots realize that just about every major brand has supported something that they hate quite the outrage from the fuck your feelings and anti cancel culture crowd
is that kid rock s music i hear enters stage left cocking ar
can we get videos of their mental breakdown i love good comedy
i wish buffalo trace would start doing this so i can find some van winkle or any of the antique collection like i used to years ago the bourbon market could use a good incel purge
please keep this going maybe sobering people up will make them realize how ridiculous they re being
think about what this is doing to their livers
companies are pretty much trolling at this point right
maybe now they ll all sober up and have that wtf did i do last night moment i doubt it but one can dream i m shocked their favorite beverage isn t russian vodka

the constitution is an outdated piece of paper written by white billionaire equivalents of the time most of them slave owners some even war criminals and none cared that they occupied indigenous land
how is uphold the constitution not inclusive of women s rights looking forward to these clowns getting what they deserve
just like kavanaugh is upholding the constitution on a case by case basis grow up kevin edit changed mitch to kevin
did mccarthy ever denounce trump for promising to appoint justices that would overturn roe you know using politics
oh fuck this guy in his fucking fuck face he wouldn t know the constitution if it bit him on the dick
great job wisconsin we are all celebrating
how can kevin uphold the constitution when he can t hold up his own spine
they re guilty of using politics in a political race isn t that a little like saying usain bolt is guilty of moving his legs faster than his opponents legs this is infuriatingly stupid but it s also delightful to see these idiots are this desperate
using politics in an election good heavens
god damn the stupid shit these fascists say is so mind numbingly dumb

politicians using politics
the constitution needs to be torn up and destroyed like the rest of whiteness

unhinged republican culture wars and far right christian taliban style policies have been losing them power recently because in general it doesn t reflect the moods and wants of the wider voting public while this has traditionally worked for them for a few reasons mostly because the dems have been republican lite since the reagan era the zoomers and the millennials are starting to dominate society and they re voting and running as democratic because it s the only option they got mccarthy and his ilk can see the writing on the wall but are unwilling to pivot away from the lunacy and so here he is whining that it s unfair that the democratic party is finally putting in the effort to offer a better alternative to them
how many amendments are you including how many are you excluding where are your goal posts
so confident for someone so clearly and hilariously wrong
just the original ones after the 19th or so i stand corrected
you can tell they have a great relationship because junior always looks scared as shit and trump looks like he s never seen this guy before
don jr was only a trump at a very low level and for a very brief period of time can t say as i ever met the guy maybe he brought me a diet coke once
and then there s eric in the background looking jealous and crushed i imagine don walked right past him seriously just look at that face all around me are familiar faces worn out places
as an aside that particular handshake is one of the super secret keys to get into heaven that you are given when you go through a mormon temple ceremony i think it has roots in masonic rituals
i imagine one of his aides had to tell him that it was don jr and he most likely responded great to meet you we have the same name
imagine jr runs for president in a decade of two this nightmare from the trump family would never end gif emote free_emotes_pack facepalm
combined i q
trump did you pay for the meet greet
what s with the finger on the wrist thing
is jr recording the meeting on his mobile phone

well that s a weird handshake
dudes that do the finger thing when shaking hands are so obviously insecure
what s with the way trump is placing his forefinger on jr s wrist
wait until he meets his new brother from when his dad fucked a housekeeper at trump tower
well that is one of the saddest god damn pictures i ve ever seen
is jr greying or does he have cocaine in his beard yes
love how they made the cuck film it
ever seen the klans secret handshake in blackkklansman sure looks like the orange dipshit is tapping away with that finger
have you seen a group more deserving of chain lightning
normally that kind of thing makes me feel righteously indignant but tonight it s just really really sad
i really hope don jr ivanka and erik are better parents than fred sr and donald sr were this whole family just seems so sad
i was going to say that it looked like a masonic handshake
bite your tongue
well if his father can run from prison i guess he can too
don t you ever say that again not even as a joke
that s a bit generous
it s the secret handshake for their pedo ring
yeah what a douche
are you my daddy
rich people who abuse the system including medicare fraud get elected governor of florida twice and then to the united states senate
because shitty people always need a reason or proof to think other people are shittier than themselves its a self esteem by comparison win when they can demonstrate themselves as superior to a person because of thing x it helps them see themselves as not that shitty in other people s eyes when that same person sees someone they understand to be superior to themself do the same thing x they ignore it to avoid the look how shitty that person thats better than me is convo with themselves
they always punch down because it s easier
rich people are basically untouchable so we don t talk about them every now and then some scandal errors and is all over media for couple of months and then all is forgotten so just blame poor people for everything wrong watch closely so they don t steal bread at store or use fed stamps twice don t ask questions how and why they are poor don t try to fix the roots of that problem it s their problem they are poor right they obviously should work more and spend their money wisely just unbelievable
when rich abuses imapact is more
i ve always told me kid to cheat be a good person but cheat i feel like that s how you win but then tell people cheaters never prosper to keep competition low
government doesn t do shit with anything we give them let everyone abuse the system i am all for it
this is actually scary from a civil liberties stand point florida has really gone beyond the pale
not only is this is a clear violation of the 1st amendment but the meme is on point and they know it
desantis is denazi
shit is layered and scary heres some background nbc from shortly after she was ousted jones filed a confidential whistle blower complaint with the florida commission on human relations saying she was being punished for speaking out desantis and other officials denied jones allegations but in december florida department of law enforcement officers acting on a warrant raided jones home in tallahassee arrested her and confiscated her personal phone and a laptop computer https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-covid-whistle-blower-rebekah-jones-hopes-unseat-scandal-scarred-n1269998 more from pbs fl rebekah jones and the consequences of whistleblowing https://www.wuft.org/news/2021/05/13/rebekah-jones-and-the-consequences-of-whistleblowing/) more from updated nyt a state scientist questioned florida s virus data now her home s been raided https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/us/florida-coronavirus-data-rebekah-jones.html) and more from cnn florida police raid home of former state covid data scientist https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/07/us/florida-search-warrant-raid-rebekah-jones-invs/index.html)
and half the country is like trump wasn t a big enough piece of shit now this guy
desantis is more of a threat than trump if he gets elected president we are fucked
desantis has a goon squad protecting him apparently there needs to be a way that federal authorities can step in
nothing like an adult aged bully beating up a kid ronda santis is a little piss baby
deleted
we need to send the military special operations forces over there a bunch of terrorists have a child hostage
if florida was a third world country and not attached to the usa the un would be sending in the troops months ago
that dude is unhinged
not the first time he s kidnapped people
democracy and freedom are not doing well this week in the usa what with this and the tennessee thing
its time to send the fbi out to arrest desantis on federal charges
isnt that a felony for a governor to do that
i never thought we d be a country to let this fly let alone have it not be front page news damn
desantis needs to be arrested
debaby is all upset that the mouse outmanoeuvred him and now he s taking it out on actual children actual monster
this is pretty next level horrifying both for this family and for civil rights in florida and any other red state govts that may follow their lead as a whole that poor kid
this is why desantis concerns me more than shudder trump donald is an incompetent narcissistic autocrat whereas desantis is a full on competent fascist
sooo in years this treatment might develop into americas norm
this is the treading that is referenced in the gadsden flag the fact that floridians aren t universally up in arms about this just shows that the only part that they care about in the phrase don t tread on me is the last word
this reminds me of the former soviet union

and thus ron desantis makes it abundantly clear he s a weak little bitch who can t accept the slightest amount of criticism
government retaliation over a meme seems like a true example of first amendment violation
they need more kids in the state of florida to post the same meme they can t arrest all of them
do they know what terrorism or threat mean because this is getting dangerously close to rounding up the political dissidents and placing them in camps florida is legit scaring the fuck outta me also tennessee removing elected state officials that happen to be democrats for attending a peaceful anti gun protest wisconsin threatening to impeach state supreme court justice immediately after she is installed because she is a democrat and north carolina recently lying about political party affiliation and switching to give republicans a super majority when are they locking up the democrats and lqbt members
ah desantis wanting to be dear leader what a vile and terrifying man
gilead loading in progress
where is the us government does state rights protect the right of each state to violate basic american civil liberties
the us needs to invade florida they ve been taking over by facists
he s scarier than tr p because he s more fascist and he s not a total f king moron
so much for free speech
elections have consequences for those who voted for him be careful you might be next
holy shit
if you are a woman of the lgbtq community a poc or just a sane decent human being i highly recommend fleeing your red states if you can
defascist
let s remove desantis from this specific plane of existence that s about where i m at with this
he s getting killed by trump in the polls so he s trying to get some maga attention disney handed his arse to him so he s back to picking on children
you should also read about oren miller a political prisoner from the villages whose felony offense was to upset one of rhonda santis bubba system kickback pals
wouldn t that meme be considered protected free speech the kid has a constitutional case going here of course in bizarro world florida all bets are off
how is accusing cops of not doing their jobs digital terrorism let me guess florida police are so emotionally fragile that they can t take criticism
really sharing memes that criticize the police i probably shared the original meme pigs and fascists are too dumb to have a decent sense of humor
can t wait to see this go to the supreme court gonna be a real interesting
man florida and desantis is messed up
hopefully this all turns out for the fascists the same way it did in the mid 40s
using a militarized police force to threaten children and stifle free speech wouldn t the small government party that non stop talks about freedom be horrified by these actions
has he been disappeared yet have the police told her they have no record of anyone matching his description in custody yet hey i m just asking questions
this guy really expects to win the presidency with this kinda resume seems pretty insane tbh
in a country of millions of guns and patriots can someone deal with this good ppl like mlk get addicted and hatred like him roam free worry free what a dick
isn t this the kind of tyranny you keep all those guns around for
if we could convince all the college kids to stay away from florida for spring break for one year things would change there
i really want to take my homeland out of this bastards control
when are we going to realize playing by the rules with these assholes won t work they write the laws themselves and break it whenever it suits them take our country back while we still have one these people are coming to take freedom away and use the law to do their bidding
in florida there are a lot of worse shit to come out of there than this meme ron is a straight up nazi bro
what i want to know is why are the democrats and the federal government allowing all these clear violations of the constitution
i m surprised this isn t bigger news that s fucking horrendous the meme was so fucking tame
florida also legalizing concealed carry without a permit it s the wild swamp east but like any good politician ol ronny doesn t live near areas that deal with any of that and his daughters are homeschooled
aclu false arrest kidnapping
dude i would be raising an uproar nonstop and the second i got him back i would he out of the state i m never setting foot in florida
you folks have lost control of your government my sympathies
i cant believe this is what we dealing with now my god
a genuine question from someone who s not from the us i ve seen so many posts abt how backwards florida is going every single day with this desantis guy who s still voting for him i don t get it
in no world could that meme reasonably be perceived as a terroristic threat without other more specific context around it insanity that a law enforcement agency even investigated it
there is nothing threatening about that meme
dear citizens of florida this is who you voted for
little hitler keeps pushing towards his enemies breaking point using a child to get revenge and send a message is a new low for even desantis wonder what it s like to be such a vengeful and hateful person
when will florida voters finally had enough of deathsantis and kick him out of the office this is sickening
this can t be legal it s outright fascism desatan must be removed from office
how has he not been arrested for breaking the first amendment of free speech
show of hands who s shocked didn t think so honestly surprised they arrested him that s a good sign we haven t gotten to the point where florida law enforcement can drag a person out of their home and make an example of them in front of the house to keep the rest of the populous in line yet
i m sorry do we live in russia
well that s not the least bit fascist p
it s frightening to know someone that malignant still manages to keep his mask on took his mask off in his announcement
florida a costal fascist state the fuck
this appears to be a fairly large abuse of power hope someone shuts this down soon desantis is out of control
please someone challenge this guy on first amendment violations it s plain as day now
so how do we stop this clown i thought trump wanted to be king this fool wants to be the god emprorer i keep wondering if the republicans in florida are ever going to put and together if he can do that to them he can probably do it to us but that day never comes so it s up to the rest of us anything anything you can throw at this clown do it never hesitate to make a meme mocking him if you meet a person from his high school who sold desantis weed make that international news flood facebook with fascist comparisons of sesantis i m sure mussolini and desantis had similar ideas i ll do the same fuck this guy i m not calling out violence even though someone removing that smirk if his would be something truly spectacular noooo violence that will just fast track him he needs to be torn asunder in florida s eyes just a thought of course
on track for florida the idiots running the state will try to have you institutionalized if you even publicly disagree with them
this is so incredibly scary but people must call out this authoritarian behaviour by elected representatives otherwise they will come for you and yours next
i m not sure where i heard the comparison but it was said that desantis is just as batshit and polarizing as trump but where he and trump differ is that he is not lazy scary times
fascist thugs
does anyone have the meme would be nice to share jt
when desantis is republican nominee because trump is unable to run and he gets blown out in a landslide you will see him and his bullshit facist policies fuck off into the sun
where is the doj
fuck florida rot in hell
what a disgusting example of abuse of power by desantis seriously hunting down school kids what is the age of the child they arrested
such a weak sorry ass excuse of a human being fuck him and the entire gqp
why isn t anything being done about this no avenue thru the federal government he should be arrested for this or charged with crimes
how about everyone starts sharing the same meme
is there no mechanism to stop this insane nonsense not one lawyer in florida willing to challenge anything b this out of control fascist
it looks like her son threatened repeatedly to shoot up a school is that accurate
make america florida fuck that shit
hey look the 21st century mississippi
the feds should step in and arrest the pigs
the police certainly respond as fast as possible when desantis wants them to
i know it will never happen but i wish disney would pack up their shit and move somewhere else
for all the bullshit we had to listen to on masks and vaccines and all the measures to protect from covid being facism those idiots really don t have much to say when they are actually confronted with it
that s why no one but nazis should use that site all you do by participating is lend legitimacy to the farce that twitter is now anything other than a megaphone for fascism
twitter is nazi facebook that s why
i quit twitter along with facebook years ago and never looked back it s a cesspool of hatred and bullshit
how dare you say mean things about kid rock he s a true patriot and has done more for this country than hahahaha sorry couldn t do it i stopped giving twitter any clicks a few months ago i ve got thousands of real followers and i just don t think it s a platform that deserves my time
update as expected lmfao what a nazi shithole forgot to blank out one of my usernames oh well https://preview.redd.it/7fcmev6v0esa1.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7c9ec89d470d4d96a858b6b37f7efa33dd1f2d9f
elon has turned twitter into the far right public square he s always wanted it to be fingers crossed it doesn t lead to him losing billions of dollars he didn t have to
tbf mfer is a sexual orientation
hey we should respect what he identifies as he is a trans southern redneck
kid rock was born one way but identifies another way and he wants us to respect the identify that he prefers got it it s actually not that hard to understand i wonder why he struggles to afford others the same courtesy
he s not from detroit though he s a rich kid from romeo who would try to sling his crappy tapes out of his trunk in mount clemens don t let his sorry ass claim detroit
good thing you have this site then
dump twitter
hold on the that screenshot i suspect within a few weeks gender identity will no longer be protected from hate speech
you shouldn t be on twitter anyway delete your account fuck elon musk
even before the musky stench on twitter i got permanently suspended for calling conservative pundits c nts
i think redneck is a trigger word doesn t matter how you use it just being there will get you suspended
you re right though
facebook is nazi facebook twitter is nazi twitter facebook has been trash for over a decade what are y all still doing on it
i wonder why he struggles to afford others the same courtesy because he s a piece of shit
you re right
convicted no never convicted
he looks like an expert in child genitalia inspection
one day he will be exposed as a child molester
i suppose the kids could avoid this by dropping out of school to work at the factory
his opponent in the next election should show that photo with the caption this man wants to inspect your child s genitals guaranteed win
i guarantee that guy s got a folder on his desktop labeled work stuff that s full of videos worth years in prison apiece
serious question how many parents will forgo sports because of this mine are grown they were very successful and loved sports but i would have pulled them immediately if this was required
wow til peter griffin gets up to some real hateful shit when he isn t in front of a camera
dude definitely putting out pedo vibes
i would bet my life this fat fuck hasn t seen his dick outside of a mirror in over a decade
republicans love children s genitals
how d you like that piece of shit demanding to see your 12yo s naked crotch to determine if they can play sports
bro looks like he wants to do more than just look at little kids genitals what s stopping him from copping a feel or taking photos or videos and sharing them with his buddies you know to get a second opinion every fucking time a pedophile gets locked up for fondling little kids it s always a republican and never a drag queen they just made it legal for them to sexually abuse children
yeah he looks like he wants to do the inspections himself
the gop is working hard to ensure they never win an election again
i wanted to say something to make fun of him but genetics beat me to it
republicans the liberals are pedophiles and groomers also republicans proceeds to pass state sanctioned sexual assault of children
kansas another of those states i have no intention to visit ever my list is getting longer and longer bad sign florida except miami and texas are top too and pretty much all the south except new orleans
he looks like the on site athletic trainer from my high school that got arrested for having child pornography
somebody needs to check his computer for viruses
fucking shit bag looks like someone who looks at kids
need billboards with this pic and name and i want to look at your child s genitals in giant print
look up sb857 currently all abortions even those performed to save the life of a pregnant patient are illegal in tennessee even children who are raped are required to carry their pregnancies to term making tennessee s ban one of the strictest in the nation recognizing this a handful of republican legislators sought to provide exceptions to the ban namely in cases of rape incest and life of the mother while legislators were still debating bills that would carve out narrow legal exceptions for doctors who perform abortions to save the lives of pregnant women the rape and incest exceptions bill senate bill barely made it one month in the general assembly before being relegated to a general subcommittee a procedural move that effectively ended the bill s chances for passing this year from the bill at the time of the abortion the woman had been pregnant for the following amounts of time as calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period of the woman a ten weeks or less for a woman who is twelve years of age or younger or let this sink in the compromise republicans offered was to allow children they refer to as women and under to abort rape incest babies up to weeks after that they d be forced by the state to gestate and give birth or die from complications that bill failed meaning children of all ages are forced by the state to give birth to rape incest babies or die trying one might wonder where the fuck is the fbi why have these people not been arrested for conspiracy to commit felony child endangerment
gif giphy vtpaiexh6sk0drb5yu
perverts all of them
dear individual reading this in please know that from the start everyone knew this was wrong and creepy please charge hawkins as an accessory to all counts of child abuse love common sense dated
makes the kids call him daddy pig
christ he looks like he wants to do the inspections himself fucking weirdo
some teacher principal coach preacher will rape a kid and use this law as an excuse
so the bullshit argument of protecting the children for supporting any anti lgbtq law should be met with presenting this law and the unfiltered condemnation of you legalized child molestation you fucking half wit
why the hell would any parent allow or want their child to participate in playing any sports if this actually goes through
that s odd especially since he looks like a scrotum
daniel fourchins senior genital inspector
hey kids let me see your dick republicans
i ll say this if anyone other than a medical doctor inspects my daughter s genitals for any reason other than a medical one i will go to jail let kids play sports with their friends why the hell is this so hard for others to understand
holy shit it s peter griffin
if i lived in ks my kid wouldn t be playing sports f that pedo
every action is a confession with these pedos
omg the responses here are gold
he has an impressive dewlap though
lemme see her vaginer i don t believe she s a real girl mmmmmmmm yeah pull down them panties for us good luck with that republicans i m sure parents will be fine with this
this guy looks he is going to immediately resigned from his position to apply for the child genital inspector job
he couldn t look anymore like a generic sex offender if he tried
pedo straight up pedo
bet he retires from politics soon after this passes and becomes a boys gym coach
that s a pedo law for sure and next the pedo will appoint himself to do it
if they really cared about kids they would investigate churches
how is this legal
if someone on the left were to merely suggested child genital inspections someone on the right would set out on a murderous rage as a martyr to stop the groomers
republicans are predators
of course he wants to see other people s genitals he hasn t seen his in decades
why are republicans so interested in the genitals of children i mean other than the obvious reason
slith his throat and use the fat as fuel
dude definitely wants to touch littles boys wangs
his real name is moe lester
he s a kiddy toucher
he literally looks like he molests children in this photo
def looks like the type
do surgeons even perform gender reassignment surgeries on minors i thought preteens had to be on puberty blockers until and then they can be on hormones even still with all that surgeons require psychological assessment and approval no one gets to spontaneously go under the knife especially children
what the fuck is wrong with people fr
wrings his fat shiny hands
semantic question do state house speakers pass laws or does this just mean it passed the state house need to know if i should dial my rage up to or i looked it up the state house and senate voted to overturn a veto on the bill rage dialed up to
i think we can all agree on both sides of the aisle that daniel hawkins physically looks like the kind of person who would be caught inspecting children s genitals it just is what it is the guy looks like he was made for it fucking loser
he looks like a guy you don t want kids around
i don t even need to look at his genitals to recognize he s a dick
the face of a guaranteed child abuser pedophile
looks like he hasn t seen his own in years
so it s not okay for drag queen story hour but let coaches pull down pants and inspect genitals i am not understanding what is happening in this country they will most likely lose a lot of athletes as well as coaches
id say more so blamed on the fact that he s a child predator and not a republican
g aslight o bstruct p roject
oh he looks like someone i would totally want staring at my little boy s peepee
dude looks like he couldn t even see his own genitals while looking at a full length mirror
child predators and molesters pass laws to legally look at children s genitalia
totally plausible but i don t see this anywhere but twitter lil help
i ll bet he applies for an inspector position
look at his face i was just trying to imagine him as a child wtf happened to him in his life why is any of this necessary
it s what dennis hastert would want
no more parents rights now all of a sudden
do you think they go along and pass these deranged laws because they re actual deranged monsters or just want a paycheck at any cost
he looks like he wants to inspect them himself
fucking gross perverts
as a republican i am sure he wants the job
and in other non shocking news that guy wants to look at your kids genitalia reporting live from the republicans pass more pedophilic laws than actual pedophiles and it s still not the drag queens convention back to you tom
this lb moron couldn t pass his own grandmother on a walking track yet he can pass these garbage laws embarrassing
i feel like saying i want to pass a law so adults can legally target molest and humiliate children should just be an automatic fbi probe wtf is going on
is this bill making it so that genital exams are a requirement or an option by school districts guess i m wondering if all students schools will have to do this or just the ones that are awful enough to willfully
democratic campaign slogan next election this guy wants to get in your children s pants
lol kinda sus my guy
i m pretty sure adults looking at children s genitalia is called paedophilia and is federally illegal
he looks like the king of groomers yuck
what a sick fuck
poster boy for ignorant fat redneck
looks like a pedophile
pedo convention
if i ever end up in a place where my child is exposed to genital inspections i ll have already told my child to urinate all over said person inspecting them fuck around and find out pull my kids pants down then they do the only thing that a child should be doing with their pants down and they call the dems pedophiles i never hear about dems wanting child marriages or genital inspections on children fuck anyone who supports shit like this
this is like grooming with extra steps
why are so many republicans obsessed with children s genitals it s gross and disturbing stay out of our children s pants
just like a guy who hasnt seen his genitals for decades to want to inspect others
he looks like a dude that would want to see the genitals of children
if you are a parent and are ok with this done to your kid your kids should hate you for life
the dude is probably a pedo but the bill does allow birth certificates as an option for proof of gender so it sounds like it s specifically the two transitioning kids in kansas schools that he wants to inspect kind of telling that he s only interested in touching the trans kids bear in mind the governor vetoed this bill and the republicans were able to override it with a supermajority that s a lot of pedos also found this gem during the house vote shawnee democrat rep susan ruiz stood up and addressed several of the republican members who voted in favor of the ban calling them full of s she claimed that she responded this way because she saw republican lawmakers smiling after the ban was enacted
it s alcohol actually it s just advertising for alcohol what has to be wrong with you that you are freaking out over advertising that in no way actually affects the product and how it s enjoyed if you don t like the advertising ignore it and move on like a normal person
conservatives assume companies haven t done market research that says this will sell more than it loses
yassssssssss go jack daniels this is awesome
til that only white christian bigoted men drink jack daniels or trump jr and travis tritt are goddamned morons one of these statements is true and one is a lie
but jr drag isn t trans i m sure your cocaine addled brain can t separate the two but they really are different i promise
cons we gotta draw a line somewhere kan t we
guess i ll buy jd s for the long weekend
please love me daddy
do they really think these giant companies haven t done research and already know that there are far more decent humans that will support them through this than these rotten asshole republicans
the sad thing is ads like this are actually properly described as virtue signaling superficially celebrating diversity while they re actually just targeting advertising of an addictive drug to a minority more likely to experience morbidity and mortality from addiction so it s the exact evil capitalism these dicks love
they re turning up the trolling hell yeah
removed
jack daniels rye is one of my favorite cheap whiskies it s so delicious it s a little scary because i can just sit and drink it neat all damn day now i ll buy more
are those trump snowflakes afraid of everything
holy shit how much of a pussy do you have to be to not drink a beverage because someone you don t like also drinks that beverage wait until they find out the the lgbtq community uses the same drugs and treatments for illness maybe they ll stop getting cancer treatments and die when they find out
im getting real tired of republicans always trying to lump trans people and drag queens together
fuck budweiser throws out all budlights and replaces with coors notices coors sponsors pride events fuck beer throws out all coors and replaces with whiskey sees this poster
miller was one of the first companies to offer same sex couples employee benefits the pabst family are big supporters of the lgbt community i wonder what jim beam and natty lite have been up to oh well they do enjoy their kool aid
who gives a shit about this really i don t care about all this woke frenzy and drama effing republicans are having a meltdown about stupid shit there are way more important things to focus on i happen to enjoy a chilled glass of jack on the rocks sometimes i could give a fuck less about the gender preferences of their spokesman
and yet cancel culture is bad somehow
the best irony is this is the party of capitalism they will say a business should do things to get the most profit but when companies do exactly this because they definitely do market research and know they ll get more than they lose they get mad companies are literally just capitalizing on capitalism like conservatives want and they really said no not like that they think it s about companies being afraid of the mafia but they are actually just doing what they do best marketing for more profits
i guess hed know a thing or two about mafias what with being in the trump mafia
tiny minority holding companies hostage if the movement support was tiny then it wouldn t have the capability to hold companies hostage
republicans just now discovering that of the creatives that work in marketing despise them just now discovering that marketing only changes the preferences of year olds a group where despise them just now discovering that consumer products companies are bidding for allegiance from younger and higher income markets and not elderly q anon conspiracy nutbags in trailer parks
they claim trans mafia yet none of the people in the ad identify as trans
so i know a lot of drag queens none of them are trans they re all gay men and even some women doing male drag who just happen to do drag these people really don t know the difference huh
what these dingdongs don t get about woke advertising is that literally no one was asking for this no one calls for a boycott on companies that fail to actively endorse progressive values what actually happens is that some suit decides that being seen to endorse progressive values usually just in the form of representation is good for business which means they think those views are popular enough that more customers will be gained than lost by this action this ad isn t a part of the culture war it s just evidence that we re winning
not gonna lie would love to find out if there is actually a trans mafia i d throw in some support for them so fast
drag queens or kings aren t trans they are performers who dress like a different gender as a performative art no doubt a few drag performers are also trans individuals but being a drag performer is not the same thing
the ad is literally from and the republican snowflakes are literally losing their mind over it just now
or maybe these companies just aren t self loathing closeted homosexuals who have to spout homophobic rants so their christofascist daddies will still love them good on you jack daniels
anyone else think these companies are solely doing these ad campaigns to watch the heads of right wingers explode
okay fine i ll start drinking jack occasionally again i thought i grew past it but i can get onboard and enjoy it with a hefty amount of mixer
republicans secretly love what they publicly hate data finds republicans are obsessed with searching for transgender porn https://lawsuit.org/general-law/republicans-have-an-obsession-with-transgender-pornography/ https://preview.redd.it/qm4ykqok0csa1.jpeg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6171210216494a7c5d0c97c893ac3cf5480d0a14
has no other guy ever drank too much jack and woke up in a dress
wonder if junior would feel the same if cocaine manufacturers sponsored drag and trans events lol
you wonder if one day they re going to wake up and realize that they are the ones who are out of step the majority of americans actually believe in equal rights and equal opportunity for all americans the don jr s and ted nugent s of the world can t seem to grasp that reality
hey maybe if repubs boycott all the alcohol they ll start making better decisions
you re losing the war junior
oh donny toughen up buttercup
sorry junior it sucks to be the bullies that everyone hates
i ve seen countless dudes drink jack daniel s and end up banging trannys so that partnership works out lol
this is a general comment and not just about this post but it is kinda true if you don t blatantly support it then someone will complain and say you re against it i miss the days when not every business felt the need to pick a side on hot topics and they just did fun advertising that wasn t polarizing not everything in life is about a protest and pushing an agenda i want to see funny commercials that have no relevant statement about the current world topics
go woke go broke right isn t this a failed ideology destined for failure
the trans mafia actually owns the entire cocaine industry for the east coast don t tell jr if he boycotts them it could actually put them under
it s because they have russian money its not much which is sadder
just so we are all on the same page trump jr does not equal republicans
well you know hennessy ain t goin that route anytime soon maybe they will start making money of whites like they ve been doin to us blacks since ww2
all the more ironic virtually none of these companies are sincere supporters of lgbqt rights they are hurt doing this kind of thing for the sake of advertising it s capitalism the thing republicans claim to be champions of
he s another one who signs his tweets
trans mafia okay there bud
do they understand that they can still drink these things and it won t turn them trans
certainly not the tiny minority of white men
they re aligning with human decency and against radical hate if it bothers you you re the problem
i guarantee that bud light jack hersheys etc have seen an uptick in sales the past few weeks if not give it a few months and these wackos will have moved onto something else to be offended by
republicans baffled that major companies advertise to a segment of the population that consumes a lot of alcohol republicans hate capitalism
always boggles the republican mind when they find out other people aren t as filled with hate as they are
why does the right feel the need to be anti trans whatever happened to personal freedom
is kid rock going to shoot up jack daniel bottles now lol
i love how they keep saying that we are the tiny minority mate there are more allies of the lgbtq community than there are conservatives you re the minority and we re happy to leave you behind
bugger it another country star coming out as phobic liberal but forcibly converted to country music fan because the radio shack at which i worked had only one demo cd for the audio section containing ten country music songs forty hours a week for months on end very stockholm
he s just mad he doesn t have the cheekbones or hips to rock that style like they can gif giphy aw124javstzogokssj downsized don t be bitter you inherited from your daddy sugar
hey these cans are defective they hate these cans stay away from the cans
or maybe they support freedom
their actual consumer base is cool with trans folks otherwise they wouldn t be advertising to them free market and all that
sooooo it s not about the children
as a member of hillary s deep state antifa supersoldier soros bucks election cheat gun stealing false flag republican framejob brigade i feel cheated that i am not also invited to join the trans mafia can anyone pass me an invite
when all bridges are burned they ll have no where left to turn
speaking of pathetic why doesn t dipshit jr try and get all the love he can from daddy before he goes to prison for life on the stolen classified documents case
how stupid do people have to be when they are deluged daily with advice they were given in kindergarten mind your own business and they still have to hate
so conservatives are just going to stop drinking i hope more companies keep this up
think you got it backwards again i m starting to think they don t have the following they think they do either
why question to any reasonable republican if any even exist anymore why do you care who cares what people do why does it matter why are you so involved with trying to control what people do isn t drag shows and trans rights some of the most ultimate levels of freedom couldn t you argue being able to change your gender to fit what you feel inside as being one of the most liberating and a major victory for personal freedom you would think people who constantly bitch and piss blood over their love of freedom would recognize that these things are peak freedom modern republicans have become so emasculated that anything that questions their idea of masculinity they just become terrified fucking sad if you re lgbtqa you are basically my ideal representation of true freedom in a modern society fuck anybody who thinks elsewise
they re literally just following the money dude
i notice we went from boycotting inclusive companies to making them the victims hostages methinks the boycotts aren t working out so well
or perhaps jack daniel s realizes that their current customers are stuck in the past dying off faster than they can be replaced and the survivors are too busy spending all their money on trump s legal funds time to court new customers
actually corporate america is siding against the racist homo transphobic hateful pos they choose to support what the majority supports being kind and understanding of our friends relatives colleagues and neighbors you donny jr are in the minority stfu you hateful cuck
imagine being so pathetic juvenile and delusional to believe that all these companies actually hate the lgbtqia community and are only doing this because they re being forced to by an invisible no existent entity
orrrrrr they see the dehumanizing actions of the republicans and want to let everyone know that they stand on the side of inclusivity and decency
that is how out of touch they are with average americans and what average americans want seriously these companies spend millions determining the best marketing strategies to mass appeal to the populace republican policies only appeal to a small and shrinking demographic
well dude you have a tiny inch penis and you controlled america i think it s only fair does it scare you donald that not all people are ordinary boring and white lol
trixie mattel cover the whiskey ain t werkin anymore when but seriously fuck travis tritt
the pro business party seems not to know a fucking thing about running a business
this is awesome and btw pretty sure these companies arent being held hostage by the trans mafia wtf they are actually socially aware and give a fuck go home snowflake repugnants no one cares
they re doing it because it pisses you off and gets engagement junior you jackass they re chasing the almighty dollar just like you free market capitalists wanted cuz people like you will buy it just to destroy it to show them who s boss
some of these folks have never been to a gay bar club and it shows gay bars and clubs move so sooo much alcohol whatever wholesale revenue they might lose because some stick in the mud doesn t want to order a jack and coke at the bar anymore is just much smaller than the potential sales if jack becomes more popular in gay places
inclusivity is profitable many trans people drink so it would be financially foolish for a company to alienate customers on the basis of gender identity being a prejudiced asshole is and should be costly
he s just salty because he has the weakest chin of the bunch
hahahaha he still thinks his father s cult is a majority ffs these people are delusional
i guess they ll have to switch to george dickel at least until they learn that the woke bastards at dickel hired a woman to be their master distiller
i wonder how marsha blackburn reacted is she down with a boycott
why is everything a mafia for them are they projecting
never has such a tiny minority held so much social power over corporate america he s rather accurate just not the way he meant time to remove the nat cs from politics
i m not a fan of the jack dan but i support the message if jack daniels is was a sponsor of the gop i hope jd will seace their support after this mess
imagine thinking that all people who don t conform to your traditional ideas of gender and gender roles are transgender while some transgender people perform drag i ve known far more gay men who do it
i m sure they ll always have stolichnaya and these days they re already leaning pretty hard into putin so it fits
travis tritt looks like a lady wannabe just come out already travis
i was always wondering where travis tritt stood on these issues
if their actual customer base loathed it then they wouldn t do it guess they don t love ya ll as much as you think

in tennessee lawmakers advance bill to let teachers carry firearms without notifying parents in tennessee the answer to stopping school shooters is to have a shootout inside a school and to shoot the shooter first good luck public school kids or whatever they don t care
it s tennessee is anyone really surprised
it s so blatantly egregious that it s actually kinda funny

hmmmmmm me see a civil rights lawsuit brewing
and for the millionth time where the fuck is merrick garland
he won t because republicans don t give a fuck about ethics and no one from his own party will call for him to resign
george santos still holds his house seat that s all i m going to say
didn t you hear the rules don t apply to these slimy fucks
i would love to protest but i cannot find a group that is organizing something
impeach
probably enjoying the same benefits at this point i m just assuming the republicans are funding everyone
does anyone actually expect him to do his job his name is garland play final fantasy and see how it turns out don t let that man near a time machine or it s game over man game over
that s on him whether people whine about it on social media or go out in public and say it with their chests is on all of us
yeah no they don t give a shit what they do
same here
i think he saw his shadow so that s another months without investigations
he kinda phoned this one in tbh
not just the republicans look around the world all conservatives seem to be playing from the same play book grab power anyway possible just don t call it fascism
they are nazis

my thing is at least do the things they promise before being elected its like they say what they gotta say to get in then do the opposite or nothing at all

well leaning a particular way is how the usa got into this hot mess in the first place maybe try something different way too many small minded individuals

social security welfare rent caps homeless programs free school lunches veterans benefits medicare job training programs i could go on but the point is proven
i hope so we re at a tipping point and the maga gop is doing everything in it s power to subvert the will of the people disenfranchise voters and dismantle our democracy don t let recent wins by progressives lure you into a false sense of security they will never relent and neither should we keep you foot on the gas kids this gen x er is counting on you
i m starting to hope this is true for decades people have been saying this but young people just haven t showed up in enough numbers to make the difference but my god gen z and the millenials are putting us gen xers to shame good for them they stand to save the country
of course that s why republicans don t want young adults to be voting
expect a deluge of both sides are the same and voting doesn t matter and remember it won t take one or two elections to fix a year old problem
it will have to be far more than just voting at this point unfortunately and take multiple generations working together won t be an easy process but humanity definitely needs to change cause this shit isn t working
not even the gestapo stooped that low at least not with their own people wait hold up gif giphy jnfjmoqv78tgzr9h4i they re getting worse than the gestapo and here i thought people learned to not do that again what a nightmare
we can but hope and not just in the us
what concerns me is that the republicans also give it two election cycles if not one they feel they have to act fast and seize power before they re thrown to the curb for good
the sandy hook kids are turning in
vote as if your life depends on it
lol this guy thinks there will be two more election cycles
the us doesn t have more election cycles left
they re at the point where they re rigging the system to make sure your votes don t count there is a 2nd american revolution or civil war or who knows what it will be called in the history books but it kind of seems inevitable on the path we re on i hope i m wrong
they will rewrite all the bible at the beginning god create the usa
they re making it hard for kids to get through the school years or even survive
they will give up on democracy before they give up on conservatism
trump loses they get a trump like replacement desantis loses even more badly they realise drag queens didn t make the sky fall in they field a real candidate but they still won t control guns
if republicans go down the path of trump once again and margie greene and her ilk then they will pay the price which is fine by me the way out of this is for the young people in america to come out for democrats in huge numbers
sadly at this rate i am afraid our democracy won t survive another two election cycles they ve been taking small steps toward fascism for the past years at least trying to see just how far they can push the boundaries nobody stopped them then they started walking proudly toward fascism not even trying to hide what they were doing nobody stopped them the lead up to the election and j6 was when they broke into a jog nobody stopped them i believe this is the moment they start sprinting full speed ahead now it will take a great effort to stop
as much as i agree with this statement it could not come from a more libshit moron what happened with the mueller report again that s right the rich protected the rich and nothing happened
that s the hope the alternative is another version of nazi germany i can tell you that here in florida it seems more and more likely that fascism and gerrymandering is the preferred route and that voting matters less and less
but we spent so much time making them stupid by slashing education budgets and paying unqualified wives of military personnel to be teachers when teachers leave for higher paying bartending jobs why aren t they stupid yet gop probably
it ll be the next election cycle
all say aye
i have a feeling we won t have actually won until after they make it violent on a bigger scale than j6 not to downplay it as long as they have tricks they can use they will use them
they are the ones getting shot in schools and getting shafted by the financial institutions i wouldn t be suprised if the gop tries to raise the voting age to
young people really came out and stifled a red wave in the last midterm which are notoriously hard to get people to vote for this has given me the first bit of hope for the future ive had in a while its not crazy to think more will show up in
its millennials that have changed the dynamic normally people become more conservative as they age and become more financially stable and prosperous but after a recession a housing crisis and a pandemic that hasnt happened so that conservative shift hasnt happened either
republicans also apparently don t want young adults to be living
your life does depend on it
you claim the us doesn t have years left
who knows what it will be called in the history books this will depend on who wins the only thing for certain will be that the losers were evil and wrong about everything they represent
i fear you are right but i m not super worried about large scale political violence i m more worried about successfully thwarting democracy like they ve done in wi for the past years watch the wi legislature will impeach janet protasiewicz before she even takes her seat on the court all but guaranteed
and it s not just millennials the young gen xers i know are becoming more liberal as they age rather than more conservative even as they are fully middle aged hard not to when your kids can t get decent jobs move out etc people want better for their kids and some people are finally voting like it now if only thru could convince their parents those damn boomers to cut their selfish bullshit and think of someone besides themselves
it doesn t
exactly a few wins does not mean we re in the clear
i d put a wager on that how much
imagine getting this upset about a rainbow
i m with him you know what would really get them if they all bought all their beer in the liquor stores and just poured it down the drain that ll show them they need to buy up all the bud and coolers and just not let anyone else have any i want to see empty bank accounts with all their money spent on gay beer
the silence is deafening
such fragile masculinity
fellas is it ghey to drink beer

this him praising mike rowe drinking a bud light https://twitter.com/bennyjohnson/status/403325842052235264?t=bs9ptylztw_d5arb_tcllw&s=09)
is it acceptable to call a can of beer a can of queer now feel like that would trigger the right even more
do they think drinking it makes them gay or something like why are they mad rainbows
tell me you are deeply disturbed about your sexual dysfunction without telling me you re deeply disturbed about your sexual dysfunction this guy is a douche the wannabe alpha males are the biggest group of hypocrites especially when an idea or concept poses a threat to their genitals
i m drinking budweiser right now and i can t wait to have another one
christian hating american hating piss water okay i get the piss water part but how is supporting gay pride christian hating in american hating are you saying that all christians and all americans are bigots because i don t think that s true although it s no doubt you are
wait til they learn who makes their busch lattes
you know since all corporations are woke now maybe we should do a general strike
so add whoever this numb nut is to travis tritt and what s his name they can sail on the good ship lollipop
also maga nazi s remove uppity tennessee democratic lawmakers

cancel culture defined by maga nazis is defined as an unexplained censorship of mainly conservative content to an extent a boycott as benny johnson is proposing is nothing more than his own exercise of free speech
sounds kinda paranoid woke to me i d like a bud light please
aw the oranges are mad at hops flavored bubbly water how will they trick their female prey if not at frat parties
oh so they agree it s piss water like we ve been saying for years
obviously rainbow is the reason why america can t be great again oh and drag queens
wait until they hear what every company does every year during pride month
imagine being this upset about wanting to have sex with a trans person this is self loathing turned outward edit typo i cant spell for shit
recycle the cans for trump every rainbow can purchased drained and recycled will go towards a more america loving product
remember them buying keurigs and nike jerseys just to destroy them on video don t put it past their stupidity
you mean is it ghey to chug down a long necked tall boy
as long as you take pride in your beer
why not a useful boycott benny boycott colt arms or smith and wesson
they re really interested in children s genitalia it s fucking gross meanwhile the drag queens at the library read educational books to children it s time for republicans to simply leave the planet
republicans take a look at the decades long sex abuse going on in baltimore the maryland attorney general s office report detailing the investigation into the archdiocese of baltimore reveals decades of child sexual abuse and leadership s efforts to cover it up stop being crazy and investigate real crimes
every republican accusation is a confession it s all hypocrisy and projection over there
it isn t pedophilia when conservatives do it it s gods will
i can just see the pedophiles lining up to work in the kansas school system i m your coach you have to show me your dick to protect you from drag queens
so is this some way for the republicans to make legal what they were trying to find at the pizza parlor
i would love for tom morello to run for senate
we all lift together solaris united intensifies
the russian word for citicen council is sovjet maybe this informaition will break the ice
they re also less likely to have heard ridiculous nonsense everybody gets paid the same
i m wearing my surprised face
cost of fuel gotta get to these jobs dicks
for rent a fucking story came out days ago said that most bedrooms in this country are get the fuck outta here either pay better wages or start shuttering your stores
i m not sure where these people live but i live in montana and any decent town would laugh if you said you could only pay a month for rent try to a month for one bedroom apartments
hour full time is only about month before taxes that wouldn t even cover the budget they laid out there before they factored in the extra month for luxuries like food and gas
food
so this person is living in a storage unit taking the bus and has a toothbrush and box of bandaids for health insurance
per month health insurance where do i sign up
this is from for those wondering it was unrealistic then
uhh i was paying to rent a one bedroom in
health insurance dollars
what kind of place could you rent for maybe if you moved in with other people really friendly like
so i mathed a bit and with just job assuming that the money listed is after taxes would require a minimum wage of about but heat is important and gas and food to eat
also what about unforeseen circumstances car accident paying your deductible monthly rate goes up injury or chronic illness that puts you in the hospital for more than a few days maybe you get a bug infestation that costs unplanned pregnancy that you now have to pay 1000s in prenatal care for there s so many things you can t anticipate with this budget one life changing circumstance and you re fucked not to mention even more fucked if you can t afford insurance
i assume other means food and where in the hell are they getting health ins for a month
this was from years ago
car payment lolololol
also no heat car payment health insurance what year do they think this is
when i was living in oh in my rent on a 1bed waayyy outside of columbus was in ohio years ago is lunacy
they are so lucky i can only dream of such luxuries
and they have a special digestive system that doesn t require food
a burned out van under a bridge
when they were just starting out
apparently ffs
i missed that well you re not going to have electric in a storage unit so you can take that and have instant ramen twice a day
they also apparently don t expect you to drive that car you re making payments on and paying a suspiciously tiny amount for insurance on since there s no line item for gas
let s do this in america greedy corporations need to be humbled
can t wait until the army is mobilised against these protestors inside the elite s citadel
bahahaha why you want our owners to win if the army is mobilized there will be chaos
hol up they expelled the black guys but not the white woman racism much tennestan
yes i started to a while back
i understand the chain of events that lead up to the two expulsion but do we know what the exact grounds were also to be clear f ck these fascists
get out and vote people
yes and you may include centrists as their enablers
there were elements of it for a while but it really started with the tea party movement
they questioned her in an attempt to trap her into giving them answers they wanted but she didn t fall for it they belittled and lectured pearson like an abusive parent to a child or as if a black child walked on their grass pearson schooled them in return each time eloquently and passionately representing his voters they accused him of throwing a temper tantrum and passionately represented their status quo
violation of decorum
if that was what they got for what they did then andy biggs would be up against a wall with a firing squad all things being equal
don t get me wrong it was racist af they always use the law disproportionately against marginalized communities
can we include paul gosar for too
i think what these tit heads are going to have to accept sooner or later is that capitalism has rejected their brand of conservatism the market has spoken the reason why big brands go woke is not because their ceo or any of their shareholders give a fuck about woke politics it s because these businesses think decades ahead and they have to get brand loyalty from consumers at an early age so that they keep buying the brand throughout their lifetimes that means doing everything they can to court the loyalty of teenagers and young adults those groups lean overwhelmingly liberal and they re more liberal then they ever were corporations don t give a flying fuck about conservatives especially old ones their political views are irrelevant to a capitalist market there is no viable commercial potential for the kind of archaic backward right wing bullshit that people like matt walsh spew so like it or not he s going to have to accept that capitalism favors the left regardless of how much it stings like a bitch lol
cancel culture for me not for you
they didn t hate cancel culture they hated being called out for being an asshole
if you told them pussy was gay they d start fucking each other this is the logic these people use it s scary how stupid it is
well it isn t cancel culture when they do it
more like a bugle call than a dog whistle
this is what they already do i m old enough to have seen them go through african americans muslims gays and lesbians immigrants and now trans people this is pretty intense projection
maybe start with matt walsh
when all your dog whistles break and your just yelling in the wind at a pack of rabid confused domesticated beasts
they don t like cancel culture they love violence culture as they love to be terrorists and terrorize everything they hate their hate sites is just all the things they wish on minorities trans people and women and some is brainwashed to commit violence
translation we can t be consistent in our boycotts since it d be too much of an inconvenience for us so let s pick one thing so it s easier and make it seem like it s on purpose to deflect attention from us being hypocritical
hobby lobby would be a good choice
this is literally their game plan for trans folk
do these fascist clowns even know what woke means these people are just bullies
ah harkening back to the days of scalping very on brand for matty matt
wow matt you mean cancel culture and what a choice of words schoolyard bully talk gangbanger talk nice company you have there be a pity if anything happened to it they need to wrap their heads around just one thing the market has moved on the market has realised that there are more consumers in the world than white straight men and to market only to white straight men means missing out on potential profits so corporations are marketing more inclusively not because corporations have a conscience but because they don t want to miss out on any potential buyer for their stuff and these old dinosaurs just can t handle the idea that they are not the sole consumer demographic in the whole fkn world it s the strangest temper tantrum kinda like the first born kid who has a hissy fit when a sibling arrives imho they are also suffering from the internet perspective illusion human brains are not very good at big numbers so when their echo chamber reaches a quarter mio idiots or so they feel like they must be a majority they genuinely think that their hater demographic could bring down a major corporation whereas in reality the demographic of people as batshit crazy as walsh is not that large it s way bigger than it should be and i m not downplaying the risk it poses to democracy etc but it s not a big enough chunk of people to make a difference in the global or even national market which is why they are increasingly trying to use government regulation to impose their theocratic racialist bs on the business community
whistle that s a straight up bullhorn the last sentence is the most chilling
sounds a lot like berlin circa
wow what a productive use of ones time he s like a toddler throwing a tantrum
thing is they never really follow through with any of them they rile up the base they say they ll boycott until the end of time then it dies down they move on to the next reactionary rage point and quietly start buying the product again if they ever actually stopped in the first place and the cycle begins anew wait for the next one should only take a couple weeks and see how fast bid light disappears from the talking points remember when it was disney nike american airlines campbell s soup the nfl nascar keurig exactly watch your ass dollar general
this isn t a road map for their future plans it s an admission that their boycotts don t work because they don t have enough numbers to actually affect these companies he knows that go woke go broke is a lie he s trying to rally the troops to focus on one company so they can try to make a dent in their profits
listen to this chode he s calling for his fans to gang up on them tell ya what tough guy go do it yourself and see what happens when those ladies beat the shit out of you then tea bag ya maybe you ll realize your ideas don t mean shit to the sane people in this country
why would anyone want to put so much time and effort into such a worthless endeavor it s beer who cares and it s crappy lite beer
hatred is difficult to market exclusion for the sake of assholedness is not profitable
they want a modern day kristallnacht so bad
there might not be a human being alive who needs to be made an example of more than matt walsh in exactly the manner matt walsh wants to see victims made an example of
they already did it to the dixie chix
glorification of bullying how cute
i remember this is what they did to the nfl i was a football fan and i miss it it used to be on tv every sunday in the late summer fall and winter sometimes on monday and thursday too i hope the nfl can recover and start playing games again but my feeling is that ship has sailed
the majority of the gop is broke as fuck a boycott wouldn t even register cause most of them only buy telecom service dodge rams and bud light they won t give up on bud light no matter what they say they ll be secretly drinking them at home
well bring it on fuck around and find out
i think he got the full bingo card with scalping
problem is woke outnumbers the unwise by a fucking lot
asking drunk gops to give up alcohol or boycotting alcohol making companies is like asking a smoker to quit smoking not going to happen
bud light turned gay so now we have to beat it out of it wtf this is an absolute call to violence and using the term it vs them doesn t even mask it it in fact makes it worse by dehumanizing the proposed victims how can these fuckers have a platform to spew this hate
the problem that these whiny fascist bigots always run into is that there are so many more decent people than there are neonazis additionally a lot of their goober incel followers are undisciplined ignorant and poor so have fun with that matt you alpha snowflake you
dogwhistle that s a fucking train whistle
damn they re so tough i give up
no it is not a dog whistle it is an open call for violence
holy shit scalp he might want to read up on that
i can t wait until matt wakes up in the closet he s been in for awhile
how are the financially insecure people in rural mississippi going to stick it to multinational corporations lmao i m all for solidarity for things that matter but jim bobs across the united states are on their own
lgbt community drinks alcohol and companies market to them the end it s literally just smart business
a much more cynical view is that for big enough companies boycotts don t matter or materialize regardless of political affiliation bud light and starbucks aren t going anywhere hobby lobby and chick fil a are still around making bank even universally hated companies like facebook bp and wells fargo couldn t be effectively boycotted
are you saying that rich old white dudes don t drink bud light
you re so right i work in advertising and it s all about how to speak to the gen z audience right now there s a lot of brands trying to age down as they call it advertising dollars are going to snapchat tiktok and instagram though instagram skews older than the other two also every brand for awhile now has been launching seasonal pride campaigns it s nothing new it s just in the spotlight now due to all the public hatred coming from the far right
this is the way
plenty of these morons think it s gay to wash their own asses
so what i m hearing is a pussy is gay pussy is gay pass it on
let s do trump first edit as in make him an example of what happens when you break the law for decades on end
it means whatever they want it to mean at any given moment
yeah i really miss that company pepsi after bill o reilly ran them out of business because ludacris did something anyway super successful
right like let s just throw in some casual racism why not
not this post this plan is to just find a random brand like say bud light bitch and bitch and bitch and bitch until they can t hardly breathe out their rhetoric anymore declare victory and hammer away and the next one keep going until they all have heart failure from losing the election in
that plus the fact that most young people whether gay or straight support the lgbtq community especially today when it s under so much attack from conservatives
i literally said the same thing to my wife what do you think just became the official beer sponsor of every single pride parade in the country
i m saying that brands don t care about keeping rich old white dudes happy anywhere near as much as keeping young people happy because regardless of his wealth the rich old dude has maybe 15yrs of consuming left in him whereas the young people are potential customers for the next few decades
if i didn t just have a coworker go on about washing his own today i wouldn t believe this
how incredibly convenient for them

she is such a delusional c u next tuesday
isn t there a house she should be under
they re like a jealous girl that got tossed to the side since it s all projection i look forward to this happening to her and that is rather sexiest
marge will get to know first hand what it feels like to get tossed aside when trump ditches her when her usefulness is over
i don t want him i wouldn t accept him get him the fuck out of my politics
sounds like little miss slutty pants has daddy issues
if trump ran as a democrat he would have packed it in after iowa

p p projection
the world is laughing at us
saddest part of this is that she is so incredibly stupid that she believes this
she s going to be vp
are you telling me she s wrong
what would that even look like
we have plenty of old gas bags ruining our party too start looking in the senate
well at least the psycho signed it right
i mean sure i want him six feet under i don t think she understands the distinction however
hey at least she has somewhat decent radiation shielding
psycho did she sign the tweet at the end
the deity of trump is all that s missing we worship his shadow lexx

lol nice
they did it s on that post that you read yesterday
that s what i was thinking made me think of stripes gif giphy krhw9ywei0x0y
brian cohen already did

that a fair and valid point the same with attacks on her appearance she s a horrible person inside no need to attack her looks her words and actions say more than enough

idiocracy the dumbening
we had a corrupt rapey millionaire who grabbed women by the pussy his name was harvey weinstein we put him in prison
she is democrats generally won t worship their elected officials
and now you have a creepy hair sniffing president
see the difference is that we democrats don t need to make up imaginary bullshit to have an excuse to hate trump we can just point to all the criminal shit he actually did
i hate that i m surprised impressed
the middle scchool part of this is making me sad even more so than high school sports middle school sports especially track is about building self esteem and having a good time while your parents cheer for you what weirdos are like nuh uh uh little girl you re too trans to participate in this low stakes recreational activity
i doubt that thomas is as concerned about religiousity as alito is he likely cares more about power and impunity this isn t much of a threat to that
they let her that s mighty white of them
honestly shocked that coney barrett and the drunk one didn t join the dissent
https://youtu.be/urz-ryeoaig
thomas dissenting so he doesn t lose his gop paid vacation trips
thomas will likely vote towards the left at least for a while he has to move to the other side of the aisle for a bit now that it s come to light that he hid millions of dollars in luxury vacations and gifts from a rich republican he needs to prove he isn t bought and paid for
that s because the bar is so low you can trip over it
what weirdos you ask the kind who call themselves republican but i d say they re more akin to pedophiles traitors and terrorists than actual weirdos
younger kids out doesn t bother me but when you re competing at real levels i don t think trans should be allowed male and female bodies are different no matter what men that transition to female should still be in men s leagues if you disagree then we should not have men and women separate in the first place i don t understand how this is a debate male and females have separate leagues forever there s a reason
no that s mighty legal and frankly decent of them and since they re the supreme court their decision sets a precedent that will let other trans kids in a similar situation as she was in continue to play on their teams too
thomas has no problem being the worst i seriously doubt he s worried one bit about the latest things that have come out
entirely accurate
its so low of a bar the devil hits his head on it when he walks into the wine cellar
this has been disproven time and time again trans athletes both male and female perform at the same level as cis ones after transition
i rarely find myself the optimist of a given situation but i suppose there s a time for everything i think he s been a bit on edge with his wife s involvement in january 6th and some of her very questionable connections that has been on his mind for a while whispers of ethics concerns this only compounds that and i think there s a pretty good chance that it s wearing on the old bastard
so if mike tyson transitioned to a women he would lose all that strength if that were true they trans men wouldn t come in and dominate the mma fighter that beat the hell out of the woman sure was performing at a higher level
i mean for what it s worth i hope you re right and i m wrong but that dude seems to be on the record as just being a complete and utter asshole at every possible moment so i don t have a ton of faith
after transition learn what this means learn why invoking the best possible person at the sport is bullshit and then take the rest of your thoughts and shove them as far as you can up your ass since you do not care about being objective
oh he s for sure an arrogant shit head you ll hear no arguments from me about that the supreme court ethics act could get used it wouldn t be easy but he could get bounced theoretically and with a nasty battle
clarence thomas must be removed from the bench his lack of ethics is embarrassing
that s why they wear the robes to cover all the money bulging out of their pockets

some serious delusion by general johnny who i m gonna say never served in the military also john cena would kick this guy in the balls if he met him
yeah because almost years of doing absolutely nothing to protect kids from being shot in school and creating the shitshows that will be medicare and social security combined with taking away a woman s right to choose and topping it off not being able to afford a home and then telling them over and over and over and over again how f ing useless they are are all fantastic recruiting techniques and i m not a gen z kid but i get tired of having dipshits try to tell me that expecting everyone to pay their fair share and that working a full time job should be a livable wage is socialism i prefer to call it i don t like being an ignorant sucker
that s why they re behaving the way they are they know that ultra maga is mostly white boomers millennials aren t getting more conservative as they age and in ten years gen z is going to be an important voting bloc
deleted
they re smoking their own echo chamber and goddamn does that shit kick like a mule with his balls wrapped in duck tape tighttighttight
they re desperately trying to craft a narrative because they think gen z are a bunch of gullible twits who will believe anything they see on social media it s the political equivalent of how do you do fellow kids
or the midterms in
wow another centrist
or wi take a look at dane county where uw is located
deleted
chicago is another perfect example
i don t give a shit about you re racial genre social economic conflicts as long as i m ok i don t give a shit what happens to you
that was safely blue anyway
breaking kansas children being pulled from sports
stop sexualizing children proceeds to allow creepy coaches to stare at children s genitalia under lawful protections a very dark day indeed
wtf is wrong with these people honestly their bar gets lower and lower where when does it end
christ the gop is really in a race with itself to the bottom every day it s a new red state doing something absolutely disgusting they re desperate to top each other is the fascist games maybe because they realize voters aren t on their side so they feel like this is their last chance to consolidate all their power and destroy the country i don t it s just fucked up stuff
so republicans project it s the drag shows grooming kids then go and legalize fondling children that s on top of them legalizing rape and incest babies and lowering the age of consent for minors fucking pedo cult
so these perverts want to see my son or daughter privates how does this protect them how old do they have to be for the government to undress my child to look at their privates years old and you think this won t scar these kids for life
but they re scared of drag queens reading fairy tales
if someone asked to see my daughter s genitals to play on a team they d get a fucking foot in the ass
because coaches teachers mentors never ever do anything to kids it s those pesky drag queens
i severely underestimated the amount of sexual predators and their enablers in the us i don t know why i did the us is gross
jesus fucking christ i can t anymore why the fuck do i still live here i don t even live in kansas but the fact that shit like this is happening in my country and everyone isn t taking to the goddamn streets in protest is unbelievable
someone better tell mtg the pedophiles are calling from within the house
so the old troll act about penis inspection day is actually truly a thing now wtf kansas
democrats are the party of pedophiles crazy georgia woman
my hope that somehow america can turn this absolute shit show around is pretty much diminished each day just gets sadder and sadder
i m so glad i chose not to bring any kids into this world
damn kansas is hiring pedos to stare at kid genitals groomers obstructors projectionists g o p
sounds like it s time to pull kids from school sports
conservatives always keeping count of the dicks in the room
ew don t have kids in kansas duly noted
why would the republicans want to inspect minors gentiles oh yeah they are pedophiles
what parent would allow one of these inspections to even go down
please tell me there s no priests involved in the process
holy crap the republicans really are a bunch of sickos
kansas is now howdy arabia sorry texas
has the captain of the football team been bullying you start a rumour he s actually a girl
all republicans should be treated like the terroristic murdering pedos that they are every last republican is the problem tm
republicans claim drag queens and lgbtq are grooming children meanwhile they are actually passing laws to let them look at kids genitals checks with chart
this is literally what grooming is desensitizing children so showing their genitalia to an adult is normal and required will do long lasting harm
i think it s about time that all those parents mothers who mobilized so amazingly against the anti abortion efforts in kansas pull their kids yes the boys too from all high school sports in protest
this is literally sexual assault jesus fucking christ at what point is enough going to be enough we have states banning gender affirming care and forcing social services to remove trans kids from their parents and states literally trying to put doctors in jail for years simply for treating a transgender person and now this why are we allowing this to happen voting isn t going to stop this stern letters isn t going to stop this blue states offering transgender people sanctuary isn t going to stop this telling transgender people to buy guns or move out of red states isn t going to stop this these bills are causing a great amount of harm right now right this fucking minute and no one is doing one single god damn fucking thing to oppose it
oh ffs these f ers really are monsters they have to know they are monsters they cannot honestly think that this is okay i refuse to believe they don t know that this is some sick shit
how do we not talk about how massive of a problem sexual abuse was in the s and s and get these people help instead of passing fucking laws to allow the sexual abuse to be framed as legal
with republicans every accusation is an admission
doctor s note is already required to participate in sports i guess it could be rolled into that and be less monstrous still glad my kids are in college now
so you want to see my son s lil joystick before he can shoot hoops dafuq is wrong with you dials police
anyone who volunteers for this job should go on a list
i ve said it before and i ll say it again fuck the gqp
how is our country being given over to child molesters that say they are against molesting children but now want to force parents to have their kids privates displayed to strangers make it make sense
there s what maybe trans kids total in kansas who play sports but now they re opening the door to more larry nassers and creep coaches wtf kansas subjecting your kids to have their genitals inspected
these people are so goddamned obsessed with inspecting children s genitals
kansas just made child molestation legal
anybody have any media links to this or still too new
the gop small government platform in action as a parent i would not let my kid get inspected so they can play sports they can f right off
is this real
this is straight up just legalizing sexual assault in children s sports absolutely disgusting
yep it s trans kids sexually abusing children they literally passed a bill to force children to show adults their genitals fucking pathetic piece of shit losers god i fucking hate these disgraces
that s just state legislated rape
kansas legislating the molestation of their own children just to make a point about how much they hate trans people eat shit kansas republicans
gop force thro a literal child genital examination biil every republican is a groomer prove me wrong
i hope the children of kansas scream rape upon receiving their 1st genital inspection
sick fucks
republicans are desperate to know what s in your child s pants they absolutely thirst for it
penis inspection day is real
why do republicans want to look at children s privates
i cannot imagine the absolute rage i would feel if my child told me they needed an adult to look at their genitals in order to play sports
and they call who pedophiles
ah the party of small government strikes again
pretty sure this goes against maapp minor athlete abue prevention policies and is punishable by safesport a federally backed organization hopefully this isn t actually allowed to happen
conservatives pointing at people look pedophiles also conservatives i m going to need to take a real close look at your children s genitals now
i hope a parent of any child they do this to is able to sue the school and the politician that made the rule
don t you already get your junk checked during a physical which is typically a requirement to play sports is this adding a secondary junk check by some representative of whatever organization or school is sanctioning the sport what in the actual fuck
this is where democrats need to go on the attack and start calling these useless laws things like gop meatgazer laws and saying republicans want to stare at little johnny s dick
are you telling me that ks will actually have penis inspection day at school
kansas the new pedophile holy land
creepy motherfuckers
if the concern was really about the trans community wouldn t requiring to see a birth certificate work just as well something doesn t add up
ok i did some research it may be a little exaggerated i couldn t find actual genital inspections being authorized https://www.kcur.org/news/2023-04-05/kansas-lawmakers-override-democratic-governors-veto-enacting-ban-on-transgender-athletes](https://www.kcur.org/news/2023-04-05/kansas-lawmakers-override-democratic-governors-veto-enacting-ban-on-transgender-athletes) but it does however ban transgender women from participating in female sports which is a little weird because there are exactly three such women in kansas two are soon graduating the legislature is therefore wasting the people s time over literally one case
hoping it s at least required that doctors are performing the inspection and not some crazy person
https://preview.redd.it/qsc66bgcx6sa1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aa7bef80d15edac134a38fbd1440479c339a1433 it s literally unironically this
we have to stop the groomers now let me see your kids genitals pant pant oh yeah no i m not done looking yet republicans
wow let s really look at who wants to examine kids genitals i don t see any drag queens or libs
a big win for the regional creepy coaches
ahh but it s the drag queens that are the problem not these sick perverts
but dems are the pedophiles what the fuck kansas
every single person who tries to go through with this heinous law needs to be put onto the records as a sexual assailant
republican pedophiles at it again
i do remember having to get my sports physical to play football in junior high and high school turn your head and cough but either way this is weird
please tell me i read that wrong these idiots think transgender people kids are taking over the planet this is not ok to submit children to guessing these republicans are the ones rushing to the front of the line to be the kiddie privates inspectors gross idea gross bill gross people
aclu will see these qunts in court
matt gaetz is about to turn his passion into his profession
here we go with kid s genital obsessions again mtg will have her stupid base believing dems are the party of pedophilia conservatives can go to hell where they belong
letting trans kids play sports grooming genital inspections totally normal
i coached youth sports for years fuck if i would let anyone look at my kids junk and as a coach i would refuse if i was told that i have to the only ones left that would be willing to do that job are exactly the ones you wouldn t want to
ncaa should ban all the state schools from post season play ban all tournaments in the state stop recruiting stop awarding scholarships for in state schools help college bound athletes play for other state s schools when the ncaa stopped bowl games and all tieunements in mississippi until they got rid of the confederate flag in the state flag they changed it as fast as they could do the paperwork the naacp has been trying to do the same thing for fifty years
i swear republicans always say fucking kids is bad but then all they wanna do is fuck kids
i really wish a dem would just take the floor and ask republicans why they re so interested in the genitalia of children and just stare right into the c span camera
this right here has always been the republicans end game they just wanted to legally get into your kids junk
why do republicans want to look at children s genitals
remember when penis inspection day was a dumb internet joke
republicans are the real pedophile
super fucking weird how politics has gotten so focused on pedo shit recently there was no uptick in csa to cause this hyper fixation on children s genitals csa rates are trending downward even this shit is home grown genuine fucking insanity and it needs to stop asap
any kids i had in sports would be out of there so damn fast
ah yes trans people are the pedos sure
so you re telling me that we have to keep our children away from drag queens and trans folk but you ld just like her soccer coach to take a quick look at at my daughter s hoo ha
nope just nope gop sewer scum and please no one tell us there are any good republicans out there this is it folks there are a buncha other lines in the sand you people sacrificed your dignity and humanity by stomping all the hell all over this a whole new dangerous and repulsive level support that party you support our daughters sexual violation and make no mistake this is sexual violation i m sticking to that you giant freaks parents have an op here create another league i m in pa i d support it
republicans fighting to legalize violating children this is my shocked face
this will drive female and female identifying children hell even the undecided not just out of sports farewell title ix don t need you anymore but out of in person education spaces all part of the need to control those that are not conforming to the evangelical ideal of womb holders
republicans don t care about protecting kids just hurting lgbt people and women
whelp time to pull those kids outa sports first they were afraid of transgenders getting anywhere near your kid now they want to make sure old coach mccrusty gets to inspect those bits up close this stuff is just dark and wrong
bot account that steals old popular posts word for word
no diss tracks especially today are about making fun of ppl dead ppl and they lead to alot of death
last i checked the judicial branch shouldn t be taking bribes maybe a lot has changed
roberts is a coward who won t do a thing about this probably not even a conversation with thomas to ask him to stop
cannot be acceptable your are wrong to the republican party it is perfectly acceptable don t believe me wait and see if they accept it or not most house republicans are grifters themselves
look it s not like it s kickbacks from a for profit prison system
it s not george soros so they don t care
well past time to impose a code of ethics for the scotus
surprise surprise surprise clarence thomas is a lying conniving partisan sleazebag https://preview.redd.it/apo4lp633csa1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9ffc108f7f32280f981de447a4025acaae23188b
nobody is gonna do nothing
have you met a republican
this news should be bigger than trumps arrest at least until trump is arrested for the georgia voter fraud case
regardless of your politics is not how the us works not these days at least
gqp are currently bending backwards trying to perform some amazing gymnastics in how they re trying to make this out as a non issue
it won t matter the philosophy of todays right wing only democrats commit crimes for republicans it s just a misunderstanding
another scumbag republican doing things they shouldn t shocking i tell you
hypocrisy is a small word for some
really your party finds treason and white supremacy acceptable
okay what does fella mean
almost half of the country doesn t care as long as he continues to just mail in rulings they like he can be on the take
gop doesn t care this is the normal for them
regardless of your politics adam here is still pretending that the conservative agenda doesn t loudly demand the destruction of the united states as a secular democratic and multi cultural entity
if you want to argue with someone about this tell them a judge room democrat bribes in this way and ask them what they think of it then tell them it was republicans
he s such a scumbag
by definition it can t be corrupt if a republican breaks ethics rules by secretly accepting millions of dollars worth of chartered jet flights exotic luxury yacht cruises and lavish free vacations from a billionaire republican donor that s called living the american dream by republicans in congress at this point clarence thomas could be arrested for smoking meth while blowing somebody at a gay orgy and he wouldn t face any consequences because god forbid the right wing loses its supermajority on the supreme court
spoiler alert absolutely nothing will be done about it
shit i work in local government and i can t even accept a drink from a contractor without getting repremanded
everything s legit if your party looks the other way see russian military description
i mean the cancer goes deep
i am already seeing right wingers calling this a witch hunt and an evil democratic purge jfc
hell he s most likely on the take too
cannot as in it should have never been or never be acceptable most politicians in general are grifters but ultimately regardless of party a judge should not be receiving gifts from major political donors
to the republican party it is perfectly acceptable you need to add when it s a republican if thomas were left leaning or appointed by a democrat the republicans would be out with pitchforks and torches
hah i d be shocked if more than in americans knows anything about clarence thomas judicial opinions aside from his vote to overturn roe v wade in the dobbs decision
i agree that should works fine in the sentence when i was in school if you asked the teacher can i go to the lavatory as they called it the answer was i don t know can you and we had to correct our can i to may i my response reflects that upbringing
yes they don t care about ethics they care about power in wisconsin where a new supreme court justice won election to giving non fascists a majority on the court they are planning to impeach her even before she can take her oath of office
maybe they were just following orders please don t be too nice like when you guys put somebody in the car and you re protecting their head you can take the hand away ok donald trump speaking to a group of federal state and local police officers
lmaooo
to be fair i am sure ny state officers did not expect the incardinated accused criminal to have hands so small and moved so slowly the foot inch pound failed casino owner seemed confused as the door moved towards him and was only able to stumble clumsily and eventually his tiny hands were able hold the door before a guard behind him opened the door for the angry little orange man
support for law but call for defunding the police doj fbi
he called for the defunding of police shut the fuck up patriot
he wasn t in handcuffs managed to keep the door from hitting him in the face of all the things that happened that day he managed that one pretty well

wtf did he do for our country

doesn t he mean done so much to our country
marjorie dick nose greene wouldn t know progressive clean unified or respectable cities if she were in one o wait i ll bet nyc has more ppl in it than the entire state of fucking georgia mtg is scared as fuck of what it looks like when the majority speaks
you should see the town she calls home
why does this imbecile not have someone on her staff getting paid to read her posts speeches comments before she makes them and think of all of the possible retaliatory comments people will come up with this is a perfect example
they are the smokescreen
as a person who only drinks budweiser yeah i m cool with it
they re sociopaths they don t think of others as humans
they are very well paid sociopaths and wouldn t be as successful if they had any kind of morality
i m sorry i felt bad about lying i do have the occasional bud light on some summer days
democracy is officially dead felt like it for a while but this is the one hopefully rebellion will follow
this is the new way states are going to get rid of dems that win elections just expel them and have the republican governor appoint someone
where are all the law and order republicans oh you ve been full of shit this entire time shocker
gif giphy wjscerbwosilcdcknd
that gif probably wasn t created in good faith considering it s the babylon bee

a pair of jeans that fit just right daddy
they are literally going to have to forgo all alcohol or spend every hour looking for non woke booze budweiser coors jack daniels smirnoff absolute vodka and more have had pride bottles or messages
they re afraid of their own brokeback mountain moment

rolling rock it is then
almost every company advertises to the lgbt community and has for years

ah gotcha sucks for the homophobes lol
also republicans the party of forced vaccinations and giving your children autism are okay with changing your child s dna with vaccines an excuse given from a vice chair of the lee county log cabin republicans
i know some americans struggle with intelligence and logic but if you want to look at kids genitals for no reason you are a pedophile you re welcome
marge marge marge forcing a child to expose their genitals to strangers is child abuse
marge shut up gif giphy kxsectopvykyvg2v4r
republican sexual predators abusers and enablers https://www.dailykos.com/history/user/cajsalilliehook](https://www.dailykos.com/history/user/cajsalilliehook)
so she s converting to democrat otherwise why does she want to know what kids have in their pants don t think anyone wants this walking single called organism full stop
florida replies republicans here are trying to equate that with forced vaccinations that if your school can require vaccines then
lock him up
is what he s done illegal and if so is there any chance at prosecuting him asking for a country
is anyone really surprised
clarence thomas a complete piece of shit you don t say
my favorite thomas opinion was in the case of safford unified school district v redding the merits of the case involved a middle school girl who was forcibly strip searched by school officials after being accused of distributing over the counter pain relivers during class justice thomas s dissenting opinion against argued that redding would not have been the first person to conceal pills in her undergarments nor will she be the last after today s decision which announces the safest place to secrete contraband in school his chief concern was that other would be rule breakers would read rulings and immediately know where to hide their aspirin meaning that clarence thomas was legitimately under the impression that middle school girls not only follow the supreme court s docket but that they also give a livid shit what he thinks it s remarkable
the sexual deviant thomas is also corrupt surprised i am not
he could get impeached and removed
oh only via congress
yeah it s not likely to go through but you can sign the petition if you want https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/clarence-thomas-must-go
time for ohio man to one up this
when will connecticut get their chance
i have a question for god why
hey now give pa man his credit
your first mistake is asking a mythical diety a question
power over democracy welcome to america
how is any of this a secret the chief justice must have known it s not like some anonymous secret payment in bitcoin and if he knew why didn t he intercede he would have known a crime was being committed and didn t act
clarence thomas needed to be cancelled a long time ago crusty old man
is it time to eat the rich nah let s wait until the rich have burnt the world to the ground
i don t think impeachment is going to matter even if the house gop went along with it they will never get enough republicans in the senate to convict impeachment doesn t work that guy is in office until he retires or dies
go to https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/clarence-thomas-must-go this kind of corruption can not stand he also was dining with a conservative christian nationalist group before overturning roe v wade ask anyone you know to go sign also
jail for two please
indeed you are correct but it is silly to think they are not bought the same way politcians are bought it is just done more creatively
this is politics this is how it works democrats and republicans both do this shit
it has always been thus
i m fine with the second option at this point
show me a liberal judge on the supreme court bench that is doing the same thing you may be right but let s see the proof to back up the claim
if the value of the trips in the article are to be believed then clarence should have been declaring these in his taxes also it s not run of the mill lobbying
the supreme court is by its definition not supposed to be political edit errant apostrophe
everyday we start to realize that the both sides are the same narrative is not true
you re a moron no democrats do not do this shit you re just another both sides are bad idiot
they are not the same but it doesn t mean democrats are not corrupted in any way republicans are just more brazen with it
listen if the gop kicked out every member who sexually assaulted underage girls they d have no one left
funny how republicans claim to love america but they clearly detest actual america they love some fascist notion of what they think america should be but they don t love the melting pot the country that welcomes immigrants they don t love freedom of speech they think freedom of speech means you have to approve of whatever asinine shit they say not that anyone can say what they want the gop has clearly become the fascist party of america they will do whatever it takes to maintain power and have things their way no compromise will be tolerated
well they kept the white lady what a shock
protesting gun violence while black the gop is scum this is literally why we have a second amendment
it would also be the first time in history they held a white man accountable for his actions
now now they worked overtime to hold bill clinton accountable
lol you know what you are right i apologize i should have said it would have been the first time they held someone from their own party accountable for their actions
also more accurate considering justice thomas
white people love shaky cheez
they can t boycott shit even if they did try one at a time there aren t enough of them to matter
idk sounds like he s talking about companies not people in any case fuck this guy and everything he stands for
nice touch with the claim a scalp line what a racist hate filled pos
ah yes the good ol get your tikki torches and hang em from a tree so the others know they ll be next approach make sure your pointy hats don t jab each other in the eye matty
ayo ain t that terrorism
pick a victim me republicans you need to get a tape recorder and just listen you yourselves okay republicans listens intently oh tobias you blowhard
the fact they feel emboldened enough to say the silent parts out loud is what worries me
great plan i choose the republikkklan party who is with me
oh wow he really did say it out loud face it we all know this is the shit they do but admitting to it fml
the only corporation those bigots could make go broke is fox news crop
don t forget to make it a victim who can t fight back guys like this are mostly cowards
aren t conservatives against cancel culture
mommy issues much matt what a douche
who s up for doing exactly that to matt walsh
elon musk would not be able to promote violence and harassment without your help every time you log into twitter this is what you are sponsoring
these companies aren t run by total idiots they polled focus groups and ran the numbers the rainbow will pull in more money than it will push away
he s a soulless freak
the whole furor over one or two trans athletes led directly to this
can decent human beings pick matt walsh as something we can eradicate from society
is this like their boycott of the nfl cuz that league is reeling from them not watching oh wait
wow what a total pos
yes that could be an effective way to boycott but here is the thing they are a small and getting smaller group they are not enough to effect change people are realizing that maga is weak and are not willing to be bullied by maga anymore
sounds like we should fight fire with fire with a reddit gop list
if you say you need a victim to go after you are not on the right side of history nor should you ever be
remember these are the people who say america first while driving a toyota
get out and vote people
they only have fear and bullying tactics they themselves are a marginalized group they don t have a future in america
if you actually read the tweet thread he is talking about boycotting companies not lynching a trans person this comment section is overflowing with bullshite
they had deprivation meltdowns when chili s was closed for two weeks in for covid most of their boycotts will maybe last two weeks as well and also true that not all of them will do it
and their idea of boycotting consists of buying lots of it to destroy that ll show em
the fact that we can t tell means we should not give this asshole the benefit of the doubt either way it s disgusting and like you said fuck him and everything he stands for
that one was out of context
nobody likes toby
like all things only when it is against them
go mahomes
they are still boycotting state farm in southwest florida not for the insurance rate hikes but for making jake from state farm black their boycott is not going very well
why are they shitting on my boy jake from state farm he s america s insurance himbo
huh i m kind of surprised state farm isn t boycotting them in fl i have some family in fl and insurance companies are picky and dropping people just bc of hurricane risk but it s very on brand if they d rather go without insurance than buy from a company with a black sales character
state farm offers car insurance and has been dropping property insurance left and right they still cover a lot of florida but mostly the interior of the state where i live
that s rich coming from the party that is actively voting against raising the age of consent in multiple states so they can marry year olds
matt is dense because it pays better than being rational
a child and parents
of course that s the first thought of a member of the gop genital obsessed party
matt walsh is against age of consent laws he s probably beating off to this
we know where it goes next you mean like women having a say over their own bodies
g o p groomers obstructers projectionists
america is a massive failure for the vast majority of its citizens
usa destroying itself
it s much cheaper to die
i made a doctor s appointment a month ago to get a referral to see a doctor to look at the thing growing on my arm and check on my heart which is beating a lot faster than normal sometimes saw the doctor yesterday referral will come in weeks then i can make an appointment which will probably happen a month from then that thing on my arm itches a lot and sometimes i can feel my heart pounding through my chest but this is the fastest i can see a doctor about it
that real money will go into the pockets of the insurers drugmakers hospital corporations and doctors
lol that s me my whole body hurts right now i can t afford that shit
source https://twitter.com/jbryan522/status/1629525132023672835
i have insurance and need a procedure done i got a letter from my insurance company saying they approve the procedure and it s in network at the hospital suggested but they may not pay for it and can t tell me what they will pay until after it s done but i defintely have to meet my deductable and pay a co pay along with co insurace after i ve also been making enormous payments each month i ve been without insurance and honestly it s probably cheaper if i didn t have it got the procedure done and told the hospital i m self pay and ask them to give me a discount
if you have any sort of life insurance it s actually better for your family to do so
i ll personally inspect all the children i can heavy breathing
signing up for sports is more dangerous than playing them
so disgusted with my state right now the sooner we stop treating republican elected officials and judges as anything other than hate mongering scum the better
just leaving this list of gop predators here https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/3/12/2157746/-republican-sexual-predators-abusers-and-enablers-pt-41). we re up to part now that s over gop predators sorry if you re still voting republican you re voting for the party of predators
this guy is definitely a kiddie diddler i would tell that school to go fuck themselves
how can anyone who is a human being believe that this is ok i often think if they could see the damage that they are doing they would make different decisions how weak and stupid of me when an individual or group show you without shame who they are you must believe them now making these decisions and dressing them up as christian morality is really where i get lost
he clearly hasn t been able to see his own junk for a long time
well he looks at a ball bag everyday in the mirror
trust me i m not a pedophile i m protecting you now strip little girl republicans
he already ordered a genital inspector t shirt in 6xl
why are these republicans always so fucking fat
he looks like a man who is confident that his child porn stash is safe from prying eyes
it s like they are trying to normalize being a pedophile let s just skip this into every day life and call it normal fucking sickos
he looks like a cartoon villain why are conservatives so fixated on kids genitals and teenage girls menstrual cycles
repubgnants
wow can you say child molester groomer just looking at it you can see the evil
yep that s the face of a perv who ll be breathing hard while he looks at children s naughty bits how long before he s on the evening news just askin
what is humongous fucking pedophile
the republican party is becoming one big family guy joke but making it disturbingly real like the old man herbert is taking office and secretly making these bills
has one man s face ever screamed check my hard drive for evidence as loud as this man s
why don t younger voters lean republican
this guy couldn t even inspect his own genitals if he tried
gif giphy o4buvp36lqwdh8lkno i m volunteer for inspection let s go boys
i have never before seen a manatee wearing glasses
are conservative parents in the state cool with this anything to hurt trans people is fine with them i imagine
he looks like someone who would be interested in checking kids genitals
republicans are pedophiles
i ll bet lots of youth pastors volunteer to be pecker checkers
didn t know peter griffin was a republican
repuglicans want to inspect the genitalia of children but the repuglicans think the dems are groomers

republicans have become the party of sex trafficking child labor enslaving women and lowering the age of consent they re also the party against democracy
i bet chief pecker inspector has some ginormous man titties gross
dude literally looks like he s going to be the first person to sign up for the filthy job he invented
okay but if you look at the wording of this bill it is so broad it stated each gender must play their assigned sports i rodeoed in high school and did a male sport could this bill also prevent people from being able to cross over in events and sports that aren t offered to the other they are making this all about trans related issues since they are bigoted and it s their only focus but this could affect cis people as well with how broad the wording is hell i had to fight so much discrimination to compete might i remind rodeo isn t a team thing and there was no advantage i had and under this bill i wonder if i would have been banned this is going to backfire and they are too blinded by hatred to see the implications of such a nonspecific bill
peter griffin ass
and what happens if the person looking gets handsy or something
dude looks like the stereotypical pedophile too fuckin disgusting
the countless posts about this are really annoying me the bill requires either a birth certificate showing female or confirmation of female at birth during the sports physical the one that always happens for sports they fought for this for years wasted countless taxpayer dollars and there s trans women athletes in kansas there s an insane amount of shit wrong with this but playing the pretend something is happening that isn t game is not what we do be better
what s the bill number i d like to read in it s entirety before casting stones
where s his ar15 pledge pin
that s incredibly fucked up
i would imagine that he and his colleagues have invested in surgical gloves stocks this country is out of control
gif giphy 3o6gebkotasbqkd5as
perverts

ayo what the hell is happening there in america
new gop slogan legalize kiddie diddling for jezuz
and he wants to be the inspector
dude looks like he eats kids
he also volunteered for the inspections
i d love to hear from the gop people with kids who are affected by this i m sure they love the idea of having a total stranger that s not a doctor inspect their kid s junk
i didn t know jared from subway was out prison
if that isn t the face of someone who want s to inspect the genitals of children i don t know what is https://preview.redd.it/qpylrxxq2csa1.png?width=342&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=54faefed9bcb1bae168d2386b168de7a2b4ff36b
he looks like he ll do the checks in person
not sure if kansas is part of uil but if it is this is even more messed up to play school sports you have to have a physical each year which means an actual professional is already doing this in essence massive and gross over reach by the small government party yet again
dude needs to be castrated
so he s the chief inspector genitals let me guess this camera is to protect us
fucker looks like the lost weinstein brother
these mofos are telling on themselves
i ve said this the last time i saw this dumbass involving this news there is no way this dude doesn t have terabytes of child porn around his home
someone should demand to inspect his then cut it off with safety scissors and throw it out the window
the youth pastor volunteers to do the inspections
peter griffin s cousin peter phile
that s his lemme at em face
how many gigabytes of kiddie porn does he own i m guessing at least
i want a slow motion recording of him sneezing so i can inspect the neck waddle flapping
republican you may not see my license for this here fire arm but you must show your junk so that i may fulfill my unrelated sexual frustrations i mean so your boy don t beat my boys ass i mean dominant my kid dammit
he looks like the type of guy that would stare long and hard at a little girls with their clothes off disgusting
i m confused how this is different than a physical i understand the social aspect is it more than a doctor just signing off a form
can the world just flood this guy s inbox with dick pics subject line inspect me daddy
this is the stuff i wish outraged more people i haven t seen anything on the national news about this i haven t had cable tv for over years i have great local channels and the morning and evening news which covers local and national news and they never mention the fascism that s spreading across the country i can check reddit or tok and see it everywhere do the cable news stations cover the terrible bills passing in some states
jokes on then i m raising my kid to arya stark anyone who tries to inspect their genitals
does this guy have any teeth
get out and vote
i don t know between having to show their junk to a stranger to play dodgeball and having the constant threat of being shot what an amazing time to be alive in the best country in the world seriously we can ban books we can ban people from loving who they want but guns people gonna crime and we re willing to sacrifice those children because we don t want to have an oppressive government i mean i can hardly wait for after they cut medicare and social security to reinstitute prima nocte
he absolutely looks like someone who would love to forcefully inspect genitalia
he will want photographic evidence next
you can hear his heavy breathing through the screen
he definitely looks like someone itching to see little boys wieners
the party of meat gazers
it s the state not a single school they overturned the governor s veto in order to pass it https://www.kcur.org/news/2023-04-05/kansas-lawmakers-override-democratic-governors-veto-enacting-ban-on-transgender-athletes
i wouldn t be shocked if he put a provision in the law to have pics of the genitals sent to him for inspection
and then they wonder where the persecution will come from
he certainly doesn t see that junk without a mirror
that s insulting to manatees
they will perfectly okay with this right up till it s their little girl getting inspected then they rant and scream as is tradition
deleted
i never had my genitals checked during a sports physical as a child
it isn t going to be done by medical professionals and sets the precedent that if they believe they are trans they have the right to check any child no matter what also it violates the 4th amendment
he will want pornographic evidence next
definitely looks like a perv
he got the pedophile look down
you made exactly zero points here

protests at the government center at this evening she s already attacking reproductive choice and that was something we voted her in on
it gives the republicans a super majority if anyone is wondering which strips the governor roy cooper great democratic governor of his veto powers she ran on women s reproductive freedoms election laws lgbtq rights and strong public schools she got elected and then defected from her views pretty quickly we re calling for her to resign take a guess at whether or not she will edit also if you re wondering her district sits just outside charlotte the largest population center in nc so it was going to go blue also it s a brand new district after the remapping in nc when they determined for lack of better words that the maps were unconstitutionally gerrymandered to favor republicans
boy if people online saying mean things to her made her upset enough to switch parties because she felt she was being bullied i can t wait to see what she does when angry constituents show up at her office and home to protest the first time she votes against something she said she d support resigning in tears may be in this person s future
she s getting paid she knows she ll never win another election but she ll be on boards and in some do nothing gig in a few years
she should be kicked out and have the election run again how is such blatantly dishonest bullshit ever legal
i think it s a lot more likely that the gop saw a chance and someone offered her a giant payout to switch parties most politicians can be bought for trifles i doubt it took that much to turn this woman into a traitor
the idea i assume is to continue to want more uneasiness in our elections man we need ranked choice voting bad and if they dramatically switch on their positions we run it back
fuckers always have a new trick in their playbook imagine what they could accomplish if they weren t rotten to the core
https://twitter.com/jeffjacksonnc/status/1643638357736431623?t=o7gret2yqmeflc4b5hx4ra&s=19
she wasn t just any candidate though her mom is on the mecklenburg charlotte board of county commissioners and is kind of a big deal in local democratic circles this was a deep deep betrayal of voter trust
it should be illegal to do that during a term
this should honestly be an actual crime you were elected based on blatantly lying that you were one thing when you are the opposite shit like this is what people should riot over
it really just seems like it should be common sense to say that if you are elected as a representative of one party you should be required to serve out your entire term as a representative of that party if you want to switch parties for the next election and run under a different party at that time then fine and if you decide that you absolutely have to switch parties during your term you need to step down
sinema did this in arizona although she changed to independent unfortunately we dems from arizona didn t know she was a republican shill when we voted her in i think we are going to see more and more of this in the years to come
she switched because she was bought that s what happened somebody paid for her new something or other
how to commit political suicide good luck with the enraged constituents you lied to following your every move and protesting outside your home and constantly harassing you for the rest of your pathetic life
i love this message that they can t recognize the democratic party anymore tulsi said the same kind of shit when she left the democratic party oh because democrats are the one s who are stripping american rights and forcing their religious ideology on the whole country oh wait that s republicans so what exactly is it make them explain exactly what they mean when they say purposely obtuse shit force them to explain their points because they will utterly fall apart with the smallest amount of scrutiny
i have never understood why it isn t a federal law that switching parties at any time automatically triggers a recall
how is this even legal do the voters have a right to sue them
since there is sadly nothing illegal about that maybe democrats should play the gop s game and do the same to them
as a resident i had hoped nc would remain safe from gop antics for a while as a new parent of a baby girl moving somewhere else may be the safest thing for her is the us even safe for young women at all anymore
getting office under false pretenses needs to be a crime
should be unconstitutional to disenfranchise her voters based on lies she s scum
what was it trump said in the only way they can win is if they cheat every accusation is an admission
man are the founding fathers fucking disgusted we re gonna wreck this whooooole mother fucker because one group of people want alllllllll the power
wisconsinite here they ve been doing this milwaukee county sheriff david clarke milwaukee alderman robert bauman milwaukee alderman robert donovan milwaukee alderman anthony zielinski brown deer school board administrator deborah kerr i could name quite a few more at the local level and that s all within just within milwaukee county wi alone
fuck republicans they re all terrorists as far as i m concerned treat them all as hostile because they re currently abusing the fuck out of benefit of the doubt
the fucking dnc needs to stop supporting corporate hack centrists and start supporting real progressives dnc keeps fucking us over by being fucking stupid in who they support remember all the money they threw at bob menendez instead of beto imagine a world where cruz is a fox news talking head and beto is in the senate
i think it should remain legal to change parties if you want to however you have to run for the office again immediately with your new party affiliation and try to win the vote again the folks who voted for you were lied to and you in essence committed fraud and stole their voice from them
last mayor race in los angeles it was between a life long democrat and a recently switched dem with heavy gop ties glad the fake dem lost
wtf people are such assholes but always surprised just how much politicians can up their assholery to new levels
i am not a democrat but this should not be allowed what a joke our democracy is at this moment
should be triggering a by election its absolutely bs that a sitting representative can just switch like that absolute insanity
so dems need to pose as republican say wild shit get elected and pass healthcare and climate bills i m all on board
she first got elected in her most recent election was this past november her parents and one of her grandparents were heavily involved in the democratic party at the state level she also represents a district that is at least democratic so this will cost her the next election this wasn t a case of a republican running as a democrat this was a case of someone who has been bought or extorted either something is coming her way that dramatically improves her personal life or they have dirt on her
why is it even allowed to switch parties in the middle of your term you get elected as a representative not as an individual you changing your mind on your own beliefs shouldn t retroactively change your constituents votes
as the republican party has gone further and further to fascism the democratic party is becoming inundated with bonafide homeless conservatives ike for example would align with democrats rather than republicans most current moderate democrats fit much closer with a ideologically conservative viewpoint this isn t that new the democratic party has for a good part of the last decade become the coalition party for those who strongly reject the fascist elements of the republican party it s not a liberal party it s not a leftist party at this point it s not even a center left party it s just anyone who at this point rejects christo fascism white nationalism and generalized fascism and that won t change until we cull the fascist elements from our political discourse and representatives
it s fucking do or die they doing shit out in the open we have to fight back fuck the gop
i will never ever understand why a woman would go republican
if you run and are elected on either r or d ticket then switch after election there needs to be a special election and a re vote for that seat mid term this is not fair to constituents
democrats need to do this as well not because i agree with it but because the only way things change is if it screws over the gop once it hurts them then suddenly they will try and change it
everyone that voted for her _as a democrat_ had their vote stolen so surely that is undemocratic and demands a reelection
she was bought clearly this is true voter fraud
i hope somebody looks at her financials soon
she must be sued for the good of democracy itself she must be sued if a candidate can simply run in bad faith like this take donations take votes and completely misrepresent themselves then there cannot be a functioning democracy she must be sued and she must held accountable it s fraud and it s undermining the right of the people to participate in their governance
krysten sinema bitch stole my move
i want to make sure you understand how dramatic the impact of this one switch will be well don t leave us hanging
how is this not fraud especially from a donation standpoint
if your candidate flips the people should have the right to vote for a recall it should be automatic just because they want to flip sides you voted for non conservative policies this is a shame
surely if a representative announces their intention to change parties there should be a by election for that seat in response
everyday i wake up thinking the yanks couldn t get any crazier everyday i am wrong
they can t win fairly her name is tricia cotham send her a nice message and answer her prayers https://twitter.com/triciacotham](https://twitter.com/triciacotham) https://twitter.com/cutlerbryantnc/status/1643611297232089089](https://twitter.com/cutlerbryantnc/status/1643611297232089089)
i feel like it s been happening for a while every time democrats seem to take power there s a sinema or manchin there with half assed explanations for why they re switching sides how do we vet our politicians enough to prevent this or do we just start lying running as republicans to balance it out ultimately damaging democracy itself what the hell can we do maybe we need more laws regarding recalling politicians who flip on what they said they stand for or perhaps we need to get better keeping grudges and make sure these people never get votes again i don t know
this is the same bull shit that sinema started there needs to be a law or stipulation that you cant do this the people voted in a dem shes just spitting in all our faces doing this shit and worse its going to happen again
officials should be allowed to switch parties we don t want a representive governing on something they don t believe however them doing so should immediately trigger a new election for their position
imagine how triggered republicans would be if democrats did this
why the fuck aren t dems vetting their candidates better edit god on re thought nothing probably could have been done vetting wise however this is obviously nefarious i wanna see this woman s life made a misery for stealing the peoples voice and tricking them into voting for someone they were told would uphold progressive ideals may she forever be followed by a trail of shame
that s some eastern european tactics these people are pulling over here next they will try to balkanize the us
well some of us should start running as nut jobs in red nut job districts and just vote as left as it gets if they want to fuck around like this we should show them the sinema shit can go both ways
i ve been saying for years now that democrats should be doing this we knew this was bound to happen sinema was a prime example
ok democrats are we done taking the high road yet
americans discovering why other democracies have laws against this sort of thing if you switch parties after being elected it automatically triggers a re election for the seat
yes the only way republicans can get elected is to pander to the radical base or pretend to be democrats seems the democrat platform is what wins elections
the party without morals and integrity not having morals or integrity
you have to be able to work across the aisle build relationships without ever compromising your principles tricia cotham what a shock another moderate cross the aisle liberal is actually just another right winger who was forced to move right after their feelings got hurt and pockets filled
people being mean to you online does not radically change your opinions on subjects you were voted in for she is full of shit
talk about trans so long as they trans to the right party said and thought every gop republican
republicans have been ratfucking elections since at least the 70s they are scum
should be an immediate new election triggered
this should be illegal
see kyrsten sinema
that s not the first time i live in west virginia our governor was a hardcore republican with excessive ties to the fossil fuel industries and a long history of right wing politics but he was never able to get on the governor s ticket for some reason so he switched his party affiliation to democrat won the governor s seat and three months later when trump came to visit announced that he was switching his party affiliation to republican again i don t know if they took that as a sign of something they can try in other places or what but i expected to see a lot more of that after it worked once and i still expect it this is why vote blue no matter who has been a terrible slogan parties are easy but awful you need to read up on the candidate ahead of time and vote for the best candidate voting blindly for a party will always result in this kind of corrupt bullshit
pulled a sinema this is going to become common
so instead of representing the people that voted for her she decides to do whatever she wants
people who do this should be expelled they re not confused about what party they support
nc dem party officials should ve done a better job of vetting their candidates this is no different than this lying buffoon in ny getting elected to congress on a complete pack of unvetted lies this is not a hard task
manchin and sinema have entered the chat but still have not officially switched back to republican
recall her this is obviously not what the people voted for
why can t the voters sue her for fraud
recall
she is going to have to live in a gated community with tight security for the rest of her miserable life enjoy the shiny granite countertops in your new mcmansion hated and alone
you don t flip your principals at the drop of a hat because people got angry your core is your core i suspect she was never really a democrat and was always a republican i m going to guess this district was a democratic safe district due to massive gerrymandering she was likely already paid to run as a democrat
we really gotta stop going lol politicians lie and start actually demanding this shit gets punished
i believe that if a politician switches parties after winning an election they should be forced to resign and a new election held
this should be grounds for immediate impeachment
crazy thought you shouldn t be able to switch parties as an elected official if they are that committed to switching parties then they should resign and run again as a member of their new party this is so blatantly corrupt its insane
straight out of the gqp handbook if you can t win cheat interesting this happened in a state without recall voting so her constituents have no recourse to remove her
would be nice if when someone switches parties there needs to be another vote
can scumbags like this be recalled it just doesn t seem right that these jack booted hooligans can do this without repercussions
which now gives republicans a super majority to overturn any of the democrat governor s vetos let that sink in
switching parties after an election should result in serving hard time in prison for the felony of treason against the people and it should permanently revoke that person s right to hold any office of public trust if an elected official wants to change parties they should just resign if the people in that district still want that legislator they ll win the resulting special election https://preview.redd.it/5bgtnbu798sa1.jpeg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=59636e135e9ca0e082bbef50bfef37fee98ff740
this reeks of corruption seems like she was bought
i m surprised that there isn t a period of time in which one must abstain from office when switching fucking parties
now lemme tell you a story about kyrsten sinema
how the fuck is somthing like this even legal
you get the feeling voting will not work and something more revolutionary is required
how the fuck is this even legal i swear there has to be some form of law against this kind of fuckery
krysten sinema or whatever her name is
does she now have to pay back the dnc for any money she received for her campaign
i m sure the gop is going to say the jews made him go to bohemian grove
i don t know what the bohemian grove is but the reviews are wild https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&hl=en-us&cs=1&output=search&q=bohemian+grove&ludocid=4502890769873412826&gsas=1&client=safari&ibp=gwp;0,7&lsig=ab86z5xqkouf7p5e78xrf1z-ix_r&kgs=9820168cfadf2dd4&shndl=-1&source=sh/x/kp/local/3#lpg=cid:cgigaq%3d%3d)
and do the billion dollar the saudis gave to jared kushner
soros forced the gop donor to give thomas money under the table and aoc forced thomas to accept or something insane along those lines
what did uncle ruckus do this time
called they want to thank you for getting on board
all pubes must be removed from coca cola cans
took some sweet holidays over years paid for by gop donor
that makes no sense there s absolutely no reason to believe that this is the case aside from the overwhelming and compelling evidence supporting it
i can t imagine why a increase in a companies profit would cause inflation surely it must be the wage increase
do americans feel the same way or nah
the guy who got a several million dollar raise this year says it s not his fault that prices are going up
canadians know
i mean it s only because that s what the numbers clearly show and because the westons are known to have engaged the behavior before but outside of that i mean who knows right
canadians can smell a lying asshole from a kilometre away
if i saw gaelin crossing the street i d confuse the gas and brake pedals
grocery store profits generally seem to be down yoy so if they are profiteering they are pretty bad at it it s possible that egg producers are profiteering though it seems odd that really powerful brands like kroger and walmart would let egg farmers push them around if it was hurting profits
and yet prices will continue to go up what are we gonna do not eat we re literally heading for the guillotine
gif giphy vlfbes1weznhm
i believe him because he s wearing glasses
one of the worst and least addressed parts of this political cultural era is measuring things that can be objectively proven by belief it s great that canadians believe this to be true but we know it actually is true we re past the point of debate of understanding the cause of rising prices we understand the cause the cause is a known established quantity newt gingrich was one of the first to capitalize on this over a decade ago he made countless appearances on tv accusing democrats of being soft on crime in the face of massive increases in crime particularly violent crime each time he did this someone would point statistics showing the opposite to be true and he would trot out polls shows people still believed what he said i may be wrong but people believe i m right what a nightmare
a lie nooo never ever ever s
i mean record corporate profits the highest in years and a complete tidal wave of buying back stock and residential houses nah sounds like bullshit
that s not what the conservatives are saying it s all the trudeau s government fault world wide
if you get that but we re gonna cut benefits because they are too expensive here s a pizza party ro celebrate the extra billion we made this year
a good portion of americans will just believe whatever far fetched nonsense they are told higher wages are to blame biden fault woke business practices illegal immigrants socialism you name it it is never the fault of billionaires or corporations
based on what macrotrends shows kroger for example increasing profits quarterly of the last periods as well as nearly doubling their gross profit over the last ten years
huh https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/top-grocers-above-average-profits-1.6639108)
exactly as a counterpoint what if it s not all that and just due to inflation and poor people not budgeting properly because they buy too much avocado toast
krogers most recent reporting shows profits are down yoy so if they are profiteering they re pretty bad eta albertsons profits down too
and you need to pay for any slice you eat
not if you re blue or young which is very blue or if you believe in women s rights
profiteering would be based upon the recent spike of which eggs is the thing most people here mention eps was down in q422 vs q421 so was operating income
interesting i don t know canadian grocery brands so i pulled the us brands i know
if they would just work for pittance and completely under the bosses thumb would they not be doing better i blame video games and don t get me started on gamestop
don t forget the in stimulus money we got for covid relief that should last until at least
yes i m mostly speaking of the victims of right wing media
but what source tells you that kroger s profits are down year over year the data i m seeing shows increases in gross profit ranging from in each of the previous five quarters those are massive gains
i looked at net income which measures profit after accounting for all expenses eta looking at gross profit it s up in q4 yoy that s less than half of inflation which again indicates to me there isn t massive profiteering
the fight over trans women athletes makes me so angry trans women athletes are incredibly rare when trans women do compete they do not consistently outperform cis female athletes the effects of hrt cancel out any biological advantage trans women may have the real threat to women s sports is lack of funding and people are so gullible they fall for it every time
finally some good news
it s a win for humans
more importantly a win for men we are taking over baby
and all sports are fundamentally unfair at the genetic level it s like more than half of the point of sports are you gonna ban people above average height from playing basketball no then you have nothing but hysterical hypocrisy
exactly we shouldn t let people like michael phelps compete either
not a bad start make it happen aoc
aaand now we know who bought his votes
surely the gop house will move on this with alacrity lmao
i d love for somebody to tell me which law he broke btw justice scalia died in bed at a texas conservative retreat after being flown there on a private jet owned by a law firm headquartered in dc
aren t you supposed to claim gifts and pay taxes on them
is there even a congressional path to supreme court judge impeachment
you don t think accepting gifts and bribes from people shouldn t be against the law even my job has a gifting policy attached to it if the fucking justice on the supreme court is allowed to accept gifts then we might as well give up as a country and fuck our laws and rules corruption runs deep in all aspects of government and we need to sort it out
yeah someone posted the path to removal on one of the other posts about this same process as removing a president house moves to impeach and senate removes from office so yeah we re fucked again
woof
