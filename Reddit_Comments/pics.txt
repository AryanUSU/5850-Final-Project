ndakasi was born in and was orphaned as a baby when her mother was killed by a militia too vulnerable to return to the wild ndakasi lived in a center with other orphan gorillas where she formed a special relationship with her caregiver until her untimely passing in ndakasi s story can be read here https://observers.france24.com/en/africa/20211008-ndakasi-dr-congo-gorilla-selfie-died](https://observers.france24.com/en/africa/20211008-ndakasi-dr-congo-gorilla-selfie-died)
what a display of humanity right here as in humaneness compassion love even
this is such a great picture that look on her face is heartbreaking
man my dog died in my lap nights ago and i know his pain sucks to lose your buddy
here https://i.imgur.com/6u8uqlr.png) is a higher quality version of this image here https://virunga.org/wildlife/primates/mountain-gorillas/gorilla-orphans/ndakasi/) is the source per there it is with heartfelt sadness that virunga announces the death of beloved orphaned mountain gorilla ndakasi who had been under the care of the park s senkwekwe center for more than a decade on the evening of september following a prolonged illness in which her condition rapidly deteriorated ndakasi took her final breath in the loving arms of her caretaker and lifelong friend andre bauma born to the kabirizi group in april ndakasi was only two months old when virunga rangers found her clinging to the lifeless body of her mother gunned down by armed militia hours earlier with no other family members present rangers quickly recuperated the infant gorilla and transferred her to a rescue center in goma where she was first introduced to andre all night long andre held the baby close to him keeping her tiny body tightly against his bare chest for warmth and comfort she survived however the trauma of losing her family coupled with a long period of rehabilitation meant that ndakasi was too vulnerable to return to the wild along with fellow orphaned gorilla ndeze ndakasi was transferred to the senkwekwe center after its creation in where she went on to live a peaceful life with her caretakers and other orphaned mountain gorillas for over years ndakasi s life was well documented and her heartwarming personality was featured in several shows and films including the documentary virunga where she can be seen consumed in laughter while being tickled by a caretaker she also rose to internet fame in when a selfie of her went viral on earth day the photo features ndakasi and her partner in crime ndeze both standing relaxed on two feet bellies out with cheeky grins their playful nature was a reminder to the world of how much we see ourselves in these animals and it s one of the reasons andre bauma will miss her so dearly ndakasi embodied the spirit of virunga and her story of survival is interwoven with that of the park s the massacres of her family and other gorillas in led congolese authorities to undertake extensive institutional and security reform within the park this significantly strengthened the protection of virunga s mountain gorillas and enabled the conditions that have contributed to the on going recovery of the species today ndakasi was born at a time when the global population of mountain gorillas was fragile and critically endangered over the course of her life however the species has grown by from individuals in to an estimated in andre bauman it was a privilege to support and care for such a loving creature especially knowing the trauma ndakasi suffered at a very young age one could say that she took after her mother nyiransekuye whose name means someone happy to welcome others it was ndakasi s sweet nature and intelligence that helped me to understand the connection between humans and great apes and why we should do everything in our power to protect them i am proud to have called ndakasi my friend i loved her like a child and her cheerful personality brought a smile to my face every time i interacted with her she will be missed by all of us at virunga but we are forever grateful for the richness ndakasi brought to our lives during her time at senkwekwe
his eyes he s in shock how sad
that poor man i can feel his heartbreak emanating from this picture people that work with animals like this have hearts of gold
that is heart breaking
she is the same gorilla who went viral in a selfie in https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sad-farewell-for-gorilla-who-was-selfie-star-zrck9b8vb) rip ndakasi
you can see the depth of their bond in his grief very sad there aren t many mountain gorillas left either i wish humans could be better to our natural world
is young according to wikipedia
poor baby
it almost feels inappropriate to be witness to any part of a moment so intimate this is a powerful image
the way she is leaning on him she even has her foot on his foot i think animals are harder to lose than people my animal dog has never hurt me in any way her unconditional love is a hard thing to lose edit my comment mostly meant losing a pet can be very difficult our pets don t know about war they don t see all of the things in life that we do they are innocent by default i m not downplaying the loss of human life i m just saying that we have a connection with animals that doesn t involve language that can run very deep
good way to go out at least bet he was absolutely destroyed by it though
this makes me sad
goodness this is so sad although i m glad ndakasi felt love and warmth from a human she loved so much on her way over the rainbow bridge fly high sweet ndakasi until you meet again in paradise
at least she had the comfort of not being alone good for him for recognizing her as a life not just another animal
aww she s the selfie gorilla
the look on his face says so much
it s such a sad picture once you realize she s dying
that caregiver is a superhero
the eyes both of them
i cried when my dog passed i can t imagine how it would feel losing a gorilla friend who is the closest species to a human
there is a gallery at the rom royal ontario museum right now and it features among others this photographer there are a number of other photos of the same subjects totally worth the trip for anyone in toronto
a better death than most get in the presence of the being that you loved the most throughout life
it makes me sad but at least she was loved
there is so much good in the world
i know some people are terrible but this picture made me appreciate the caretaker a lot what a strange life for any animal to get caretaken by a human and die in their arms not many wild ish animals die in the arms of loved ones i assume
i know to many this is sad but what an absolute gift think about it to animals with shorter lives we are to the best of their knowledge immortal gods heralding them from birth to death it s an incredible gift to know your god and to be in their arms at death may we all be so fortunate even if it s in ignorance
i love this photo i have it on my wall so powerful
the universe is violent your time short make it better for those you cross paths with
how odd it is that we as creatures with the capacity of such individualism and self reliance can take such profound and meaningful comfort in the implication of the words i am here
rip little lady
she passed away touching the person that meant the most to her in the whole world
first i agree with the many comments who find this photo beautifully emotional but having said that it irks me when the actual guardian in the picture is neither known nor recognised in this case he took care of the animal for years he s not a stranger to the story his name is andre bauman and he has shown consistent tenderness to the gorilla
fuuuuuuuck good picture
the story behind this picture https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-58826986
here is a very heartwarming video of ndakasi in her prime https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyrj-3kmuhw), living her carefree life with her loving caretaker spending time with her
ndakasi and the handler pictured here by her side were featured in the excellent documentary virunga you can find it on netflix
if anyone is interested in watching a movie with this caretaker in it watch virunga https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3455224/). his name is andre bauma it s a beautiful and tragic documentary about a national park and its gorilla population
so devastating but i bet the gorilla went peacefully knowing their caregiver was with them
when ndakasi was born mountain gorillas were critically endangered however in the past years the number of gorillas has grown by percent from individuals in to an estimated in that s a nice silver lining to this sad story
you can tell that man looks shook af hope he s doing well
i am a problem ptsd case bcos too much i won t bore with detail but from deep and sadly extensive personal experience we all would benefit from being in the presence of total love at the end it s profoundly important
i m heartbroken for his wonderful caregiver
please tell me someone is watching over the caregiver he s going to need to be watched over as well now years there s a massive bond there
animals makes me feel so sad most of the time you are the only thing that matters to them you are their whole life this is pic is heartbreaking
if only every animal was so fortunate to have a loving compassionate human to spend their life with it s beautiful how even though humans have developed far beyond our primal roots we can still form strong genuine bonds with animals
awww jeeze what a pic hug your gorillas extra tight tonight before bed
i just recently lost my baby a dog who lived with me pretty much her whole years of life while she was a dog she was family to me this picture is heartbreaking right now because it reminds me of my best friend dying in my arms it s a must that you are there for them at the end imo but it s oh so hard
holy moly this brings on the waterworks i hope it was do to old age
thats really beautiful if only more people were dedicated and kind
shes beautiful
glad she had someone in the end
everyone should see these pictures and take a moment to appreciate how much better we can become
that man s an angel for being strong enough to give her the gift of being with someone she loves at the end
hey thanks i was way too happy today
beautiful but tragic there are so few of these sweet creatures left the park rangers at virunga are some of the best humans on the planet my heart goes out to andre on the loss of his close friend daughter
it s comforting to know she felt safety and love in her last moments

as someone who lost his favorite dog in january i can t imagine what it would be like to lose a creature like this you can see he is shocked
this hits too hard my dog i rescued and raised for years died in my arms last week it sucked but boy am i grateful i was there for him fuck i m crying now and about to go to dinner with new friends
highly ranked submission to the wildlife photographer of the year i believe it won best photojournalism
most human thing i ve seen in a long time
gif giphy d2lchjtg5tscg came to laugh at inappropriate memes bro why do dis x200b edit oh also r lastimages
wow i am so glad he is there for her and i know he wouldn t want it any other way but being present for some one passing is a very tough thing to go through wasn t expecting to cry tonight
i hope to be as lucky as ndakasi when my time comes
i can t believe the ammount of racist comments people have some decency please
her lil foot i just can t
the cuffs of his pants show he put the boots on in haste as time was running out
whoa that must have been so intense
what makes us who we are goes beyond the species barrier
we pay for love with pain nothing in life is free it s worth it of course buts it still a bum deal
i m having a hard day and this made me sob
what a beautiful picture
they re us just as aware they should be protected like they re gonna be the next planetary guardians when we leave disappear
that it s a heartbreakingly beautiful picture i m tearing up
so so sad god please hold them both in your hand forever
life is so sad sometimes i just feel overwhelmed
bro looks scarred
ndakasi is showing more unguarded emotion and sensitivity than people are used to in other humans much less a lower species
idk why this reminds me of my cat that passed away in my arms from kidney disease the desperation of wanting to do something but being completely useless trying your best to comfort them hoping that they can feel your love and comfort as they pass hoping they knew you loved them seeing this picture of an animal with their caregiver and being able to see how much they love and have a bond with one another gives me hope that my cat felt it coming from me sorry im rambling here but its about to be year without my bud and i still cant cope with it
mountain gorilla ndakasi passes away as she lay in the arms of her friend of years
what a privilege
there is a fantastic documentary on netflix called virunga that i m pretty certain features these two
that has to be damn rough on him as well she has to be like a child to him at this point
that man looks heartbroken
rip ndakasi i always think that animals have much more beautiful souls than us human beings we don t deserve everything we have as humans got a lump in my throat man
if i had to put a word to the look in his eyes it would be haunted or just gutted maybe
i feel that in my soul

how about mentioning the name of that man that s andre bauma for anyone wondering
as someone who has lost two heart dogs i have to say that what this person is doing in this photo is extremely hard to do to hold a being that means so much to you that you have so much history with while they leave you for the rest of your time here it takes an emotional price that will never be repaid
damn had a cat die in my arms after only years together a gorilla after years must be a lot worse
a dear friend of mine had a daughter rest in piece shaista that was born with down syndrome lovingly they called her monkey for her boisterous attitude love of play shenanigans and understanding of emotion she passed away last year at the age of it took a few weeks to get him to talk to kind of open up fuck if we re being honest say more than two words to anybody he likened his daughter to animals that he protected as a ranger in the forest service his daughter as soulful as she was was an unrestricted spirit he likened many if get behaviours and emotions as an animal free of judgement hate opinion just love i know this particular keeper an many like him see those similarities and it breaks my heart we are far more closer at our core to animals than to each other my heart breaks for him
heartbreaking and beautiful in the same picture what a beautiful bind and relationship between them and heartbreaking it ended thank you for taking care of her

rest in peace ndakasi remember folks these guys are genetically identical to humans
look at her toes curled up on his feet such a beautiful connection
the nicu is one of those things that you just have to experience to understand happy for you and your family

thats dedication what a cool image metal as fuck
drink too much whiskey cut a cuticle on a string you re going to bleed like a stuck pig probably didn t even notice it
metal af
i ve been playing guitar on stage for half my life i ve had my fingers bleed a few times if this is real i don t really know what he was doing pinch harmonics can be pretty brutal on your thumb and easily lead to bleeding zakk wilde is infamous for them but for context they typically lead to a paper cut or hang nail type of gash this looks like he sawed off the end of a finger tip right before the show started
paulo
reminds me of the summer of when i played my guitar till my fingers bled
looks metal as fuck but its his strumming hand thats bleeding so he is likely not in very much pain other than the cut itself it just looks messy because theres a possibility his blood is a little thin from alcohol and just the motion of strumming will throw blood everywhere
here https://youtu.be/m3txtrye7va?t=13) is a video of this
i got blisters on my fingers
ok that s metal as fuck and all but can we just stop for a moment and acknowledge thats a lot of blood
so paulo
oh how biblical
wylde
if you gig this has probably happened to you too maybe not this bad lol
nathan explosion approves brutal
dammmmmn what was he on
he bled for our sins
that s so fucking metal nathan explosion would approve
he looks back with regret that every concert was not as metal as this
and the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp5zyqhjlbi)shows us it didn t even slow him down my fingers aren t bleeding and i still can t play that solo
i ain t got time to bleed
had this happen while over doing it with practicing slap bass thought the blood stains might look cool on my all white bass guitar they dried and were just brown not cool at all
up vote for zakk wilde
the single most metal image in existance
i wonder what he did i ve thrashed a guitar quite heavily not that i m anywhere near as good as him and never bled like that even though i had a broken string stick straight in my hand once
he probably had a cut before he began playing and it opened up that is way too much blood to be from chicken pickin some strings you build callouses they can peel off but never bleed especially on that scale
deserving of r humansaremetal
no more tears but a lot of blood apparently
zakk has a history of blood clots and once had to cancel an entire tour due to it https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/zakk-wylde-hospitalized-for-blood-clots-cancels-tour-217850 probably takes a thinner to help this was also a year before he quit drinking so he probably had a bunch of alcohol in him as well
thats not how youre supposed to do it
i love this picture so much they are both so badass
one of my favorite shows was black label opening for black sabbath during the ozfest reunion tour izzy kept losing his place in the song and wandering around on stage every time zach would step in and play a solo while someone wrangled ozzy back to the microphone i mean the ozzy part was sad to see but there must have been solos from zach that night
the strings started to bleed
fingers bleed way too much they re the drama queens of the human body
metal stigmata
played it till his fingers bled was this the summer of
serious question do you think he knew
bleed for me i bled for you
oh it s a chariot driven by a chain of white stallions
that is not a small amount of blood lol
watched a show put on by charlie robinson texas country where his guitarist dropped his pick and kept playing ended up looking like this he went backstage between songs took a huge pull of tequila poured a bunch on his hand then got back to work
been there that s a man who dropped his pick at the wrong time
pity his poor guitar tech
happened to me once back in the day punk band used to get blood blisters from playing too hard busted open one show and bled all over
he s playing the guitar wrong if those fingers are bleeding wtf
i saw this happen to joel o keefe of airbourne too didn t slow him down one bit
i gotta say that is fingers should be callused at this point i m gonna say this is performance art much like the pete townsend photo showing him with a bloody hand
fat thor vibes
does anyone know how excruciating this would be a guitar player like that must have serious callouses how hard would you need to play to have this happen
it s a prop no
not saying it s fake but that looks wwf af especially given his size and girth
holding a pick and shredding hardcore all night wouldn t cause this to happen guitar strings aren t razor wire this is either an existing wound or fingers got cut by something else during the show still metal as hell and good for him to push through the pain and commitment to the show and the fans
fucking metal
i m surprised they weren t more calloused from pointing up to dimebag in heaven between every riff
gif giphy xzkuxufj232bq
total badass i love him i met him once at ozzfest and he was super nice he called me gorgeous and signed my dvd swoon
i was there it was real it was metal everyone lost it
gif giphy vh2bc5z0welbk
metal af
dude we re going to see zakk with pantera this year in august along with metallica i m beyond excited
as someone with fingers i can confirm that was probably pretty painful
this has happened to me a few times it s usually a cuticle you hit on the strings and then since you re basically shaking your hand nonstop it just forces more blood out the entire time it looks cool as hell so it s kinda neat when it happens at a show
crazy shot that s dedication
i don t know the story but i think that s staged his picking hand wouldn t bleed his fretting hand wouldn t really either he s been shredding for years i think this is something like what wrestlers do to hype the crowd up it only works because it s on a white guitar and as i say it s coming from the right hand if he was bleeding from the other hand he wouldn t be able to fret it s also quite a lot of blood i think it s a blood capsule i could be wrong please don t downvote me
this happens more commonly than you might think if you have a fresh ish cut on your hand or finger and manage to knock the scab off whilst playing it can bleed a lot
gene simmons used fake blood too i thought a little blood would be seen but this is a stage trick that much blood would mean an unplayable injury i m thinking hulk hoganz forehead and razor blades if it was it s a palm cut
zakk wylde
if that aint metal then i dont know what is
most metal thing i ve ever seen
how bad is his technique that he injured himself with his instrument
looks like he spent too much time in the jacuzzi before the show
fake
isn t he the one that learned he was predisposed to blood clots but only found out way later in his life when he quit drinking
if that wasn t for theatrics he probably needed a stitch or two
that s rock n roll
come on zakk myled you gotta project project what it s a stick with a fucking marshmallow on it
edit deleted redundant
i was there he behaved as if nothing had happened
my fingers hurt well now your back is going to hurt because you just pulled landscaping duties
that had to hurt like hell but god damn that s metal as fuck
only had that happen once those high e strings can be pretty slicey
lmao what is he doing i m a professional guitarist and i feel like this has to be fake if you have half decent technique your fingers shouldn t be pouring blood like this on stage
deleted
and he still sucked
that s actually the guitar s ears bleeding because of how awful zakk s playing is
pete townsend has entered the chat
so paulo
fake blood obviously
deleted
rocking out while bleeding over his flying v dude really is wilde
stage blood capsules
it is metal af but was actually photographed as he recorded spirit journey formation anniversary https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/adultswim/images/e/ef/sjfa.jpg)" with master shake here he is performing live https://fakebands.com/wiki/images/thumb/3/36/the_black_mountain_scorpion_hoedown_bluegrass_experience_gang.png/800px-the_black_mountain_scorpion_hoedown_bluegrass_experience_gang.png) on washtub bass
dedication and adrenaline and alcohol and probably some other things he probably didn t even know he was bleeding until after the fact it s amazing how your pain receptors can just completely shut off in the right circumastances
punk fuckin rock dude https://youtu.be/dx5gimpzbs0?t=512)
if he has that much dedication to fingering a guitar imagine what he could do to the ladies
doesn t he play with a pick i mean maybe this is real but the bat was fake and they are performers so
very metal looks fake though
lol so fuckin dorky
it was staged completely fake
is this another tortilla
is the color added does the color show up because it s a high definition picture i always thought the moon was pretty colorless
you want to impress me show me the other side lol
this is a beautiful photo thanks for posting it
i always think the moon is an amusement park i miss futurama
psht that s just samsung s moon magic s
amazing how every other body in space is a round shape except earth earth is flat obviously
samsung thanks for a new sample of the moon
ow damn that is sharp
could you please point out red circles arrows or similar the sharp parts to me it looks more roundy to me thanks in advance
til there is color on the moon thought it was just white
obi wan kenobi that s no moon
great photo what did you use to capture it
i no longer know what is the moon and what is tortillas send help please
what a time to be alive
samsung enters the chat
omg what a beauty
definitely flat p
looks like that giant jawbreaker i m currently working through
must ve been taken on a sunny day s
beautiful image how did you take it
cheese gromit
looks like french cheese
no that s a tortilla
that doesn t look like cheese at all
are these colors real or just computer approximations
is there really an alien base on the other side
ummm guys that looks pretty round not very sharp ngl
seems way smoother than earth without all the water
i feel like the moon used to be earth a long time about but we human destroyed it and had to find a new place to live so we can to the old earth s moon and made it liveable and it s now called earth and the old earth s is call the moon
anyone know how wide those craters are are they kilometers wide
looks like a bad case of mold there on the cheese in top right
i want to know how wide and deep some of those larger craters are fascinating
next artemis needs some clr spray with them
why is everyone so surprised about the colour let a girl dye her hair in peace
is this another tortilla photo i can t tell anymore either way it makes me hungry
wow amazing detail hard to believe it s entirely made of cheese
hmmm nope no secret moon bases very cool pic
if you look close enough you can find waldo
not convinced this isn t a tortilla
okay but i still can t see the moon rovers s
was this taken by a samsung phone this is a joke cool looking picture
awesome photo what did you take it with
hdr filters
man this photos with the s23 ultra are getting put of hand
looks like it s rust and burnt parts
ow i m bleeding
looks like my face at
can i get a download link
anyone know where i can buy hi res images of the moon to print for my home or prints themselves
oh my god it really does loon like cheese
you can almost see pink floyd
need a banana for scale
is the moon actually colorful just sun bleached because it doesn t have an atmosphere to reflect uv
i can see my future house from here
aw man it s moldy
i know i ve heard the moon is responsible for life on earth because it pulls so many astroids towards it allowing life here to evolve as we can see from the numerous craters but how does the moon with its smaller gravitational pull protect earth it seems like our larger mass would still make us the prime target in such instances
i took a photo of the full moon last night https://imgur.com/a/gcoqbza) with my new telephoto lens i should not have browsed reddit this morning
bullshit i looked at this picture through a telescope and couldn t make out shit
lotta hive down there i bet
that s crazy some of the crater areas almost look like my steel targets when i shoot them with green tip
it s beautiful
does anybody know how tall the peaks are like the craters probably go pretty deep at certain points but are those like mountain ranges or are they like ankle height
cheese
for scale how big is one crater
is the moon flat too
so unless my math is off it would appear that the larger crater just to the right of centre is approx miles in diameter it is rather insane how large the moon is i don t think most of us really have any reference to how big it is like most of las angeles would fit inside that crater
do not look at the moon go outside now
i saw that lol
here s some cookware https://designwrld.com/frying-pans-resemble-planets-moons/photographs-of-worn-out-frying-pans-that-stunningly-resemble-planets-and-moons-08/).
the moon really has those colors but the saturation has been increased in this image being up close doesn t make the colors more intense
she s starting to rust after all these years
no colour was added this was organic that s how she looks up close
i saw it this morning right here on reddit kinda looked like a tortilla
we re whalers on the moon
it s coming back
underrated comment here sad as i was so hyped and looking forward to getting a ultra
this is the moon it s not round it generates its own light that s not reflected light the self generated light magically functions in such a way that only part of the flat earth can see it at any given moment in time and such that all the other appearance issues function such as this appearance of roundness shadows from other light sources etc i mean if you re gonna roll with the flat earth fantasy go all the way
i think i need a bandaid it s almost too sharp
unfortunately the color was added in photoshop still a great photo
a camera
real colors with increased saturation
since it s tidally locked there s no way to tell without sending a spacecraft out and around to the far side
thanks
rust is oxidation requires oxygen i know you were joking
but i assume the saturation was heavily tweaked
maybe in camera but doubt you d see those colours with your eyes
okay thanks
i saw that post too hahahahahaha
we carry our harpoons
don t play with my emotions
for the moon to have phases in their model i guess it must be a glass sphere with a big light bulb and a rotating mirror inside like those old twirly lights on police cars god made it that way
sooo who changes the moon bulb
not added but amplified
not true the moon has different shades of colour on the surface due to the presence of certain metals such as iron and titanium
wrong butterfly net
probably shot hundreds if not thousands of frames of the moon then stacked them the resulting minute colour data from each frame gets combined across during the stacking process through a mathematical process im not even going to pretend to understand the colour will then be tweaked on the final image to try make it a bit more vibrant but those colours really are there just much to faint for the human eye or from a single exposure
the blue colour actually signifies areas which are rich in titanium on the moons surface
their explanation is the moon is a sphere and it gets closer and further from the earth but the sun stays at the same level which is what the shadows are from don t ask them about eclipses though they get really humble and start talking about we aren t sure yet
not to this extent this is saturation
a month in nyc
so basically my freshman year dorm room got it
yes but you have to assemble it yourself using an allen key and if you ever move it it s never the same
to those saying this is better than your dorm room maybe in literal terms i was allowed to come and go from my dorm room though and to have others come and go i had a lot of liberty not exhibited here i don t see anything wrong with a decent cell that has room for reading material the confinement should be the punishment not neglect of the cell or the spirit
because they focus on reform rather than punishment i would imagine
people seem to forget that the actual punishment part of being in prison is the removal of freedom independence and autonomy that should be enough not only from a punitive standpoint but also from the perspective of public safety we don t need to house people like animals and feed them food that s barely fit for consumption people see things like this and complain about the comfort that prisoners are living in but that is not the point they are not free to live their lives beyond the facility they are kept in that is the punishment if seeing prisoners housed in barely acceptable standards of living genuinely causes you to feel resentment then you should direct that energy towards criticising the absolutely disgraceful state of the current housing market and the incredibly low bar we ve come to see as luxury
scandinavian countries have a recidivism rate of around the u s rate trends around i think maybe they are truly successfully reforming their prison residents by treating them like humans
supposedly california will be adopting a scandinavian model for their prisons but as someone who works for the california department of corrections and rehabilitation i gotta say i m skeptical it s surprising how behind our system is even though we re supposed to be a more liberal state
people forget that losing your freedom is your punishment that s it that s what the court orders prisoners should be treated humanely
wow treat people with respect and give them an opportunity to improve and they may become better people as opposed to treating them like shit with violence and humiliation and wondering why they end up back in prison or continue a life of violence
not defending our prison system but i ve been to a number of prisons around me as a contractor and they look just like this
no commode
say what you will about coddling inmates their recidivism rate is much lower than the u s
where can i apply
i bet they don t even lock them in there for hours a day either
this is better then the barracks room i had in the us army like way better
latest season of atlanta has an episode about it
oh the humanity i mean like oh they have humanity
in america the goal with prison seems to be to break the spirt of a human being like domesticating a wild horse in the old west they want positive punishment for people in the psychological sense they want suffering not time seperated from the public and rehabilitation into a better citizen slow torment people that wish you harm solitary confinement slow drip drip of learning you are scum and hey look it is time for your release have fun out there i hope we have changed you
a swede told me if you treat people like animals they will act like animals
a month in vancouver
the difference is that their system is meant to help criminals rehabilitate themselves and move back into being productive members of society on the other hand ours is meant to keep black people from voting and to move public money into private hands different goals result in different solutions
bigger than my dorm room in college
meanwhile i live in a van at my workplace s car park
nicer than us army barracks
a month here in portland
since i will never be able to afford to live in a nice retirement home in ky old age my plan is to murder someone in norway
perspective college students in america live in dorms that are both in worse condition than this prison cell and they share it with another person
when i look at a prison cell like that i think if i were an innocent person locked up unjustly at least i wouldn t have to live in the squalid conditions of a us prison we americans seem to assume that the justice system is flawless and never makes an error or wrongly imprisons anyone remember that even if you think squalid prisons are a just punishment for crime you also are condoning that squalor for the wrongly convicted
asking for a friend what s the least harmful crime i could commit to get a room ahem cell like this
how do they mitigate suicide risk for prisoners in an environment like this i know us prisons are rather sterile to prevent inmates from causing harm to themselves or others
legitimately looks exactly like my dorm room admittedly it s a very cheap dorm but damn they get what i have for free
prison is meant to rehabilitate people into proper citizensc while also punishing them afaik not just make your life a lot worse
do they get xbox or playstation
https://www.reddit.com/r/cozyplaces/
i thought this was a super nice american dorm hahahaha
that s a prison cell
do they have to put that furniture together themself because that would be the real punishment
if retirement doesn t work out for me this is my plan b
wow i saw this and though i was in r malelivingspace at first awesome
jesus this was better than my dorm
so many things american prisoners could use to kill someone or themselves with is it the poor conditions of american prison cells that drive prisoners to violence or are the cells devoid of stuff because american prisoners are more prone to violence alas we may never know infrastructure change in america is almost impossible
nicer than my us apartment
lol looks like my dorm from college
this is a prison cell send me to prison this place looks cozy to a first time home owner like myself
looks like a dorm room in the states
all from ikea when they arrive they have to assemble everything some say it is a human rights violation
this is all from ikea i m assuming
no matter how nice your cell is it s still a cell when that door closes behind you and you can t open it you are no longer free
why do i have the same ikea lamp
sure it looks nice but its all flatpacked and you have to build it yourself with only a hexwrench thats the punishment
does it have internet
americans with the their recidivism rate saying one word about this are like illiterate people bragging super hard about not knowing how to read
i think reform is great this should be the primary goal but the other extreme is the norwegian terrorist that murdered in two attacks this is not a typical prisoner but this allows for some discussion on the effectivity at a recent hearing to discuss parole there was this testimony that was given by psychiatrist regarding possible activities to break up the monotony of mass murderer s imprisonment or to decrease the predictable environment she suggested could the prison not take him on a daytrip to the forest in skien in a part of the forest where people seldom go could he sit in the backseat of a car while correction officers purchased ice cream for him he is years into a year sentence which is the maximum sentence for killing humans the murderer s lawyer
there s a world of difference between scandinavian criminals and american western criminals
i saw a go fund me for someone so they could go to norway and commit a crime to finally get needed healthcare and housing while they worked on mental issues
i m sure any homeless person in the us would be greatful for this
as an american i m appalled at the non pravatized prison system
i know tons of people that will agree to go to a jail like that
gen x retirement plan activated
this is nicer than my son s apartment
they re great treating people like humans and not animals is the best way to rehabilitate
or as i like to call it retirement plan
that looks like a dorm room
what they don t tell you is that you have to assemble it all yourself
my first thought was someone could hang themselves with those curtains then i realized that jail shouldn t be soo bad that you d rather die
that s a dorm room
3k a month in london
looks like an ikea showroom i am jack s complete lack of surprise
you can treat inmates like humans in scandinavia because the prisoners don t act like animals inmates in america are one brain cell away from our simian cousins
looks much nicer than most nursing home rooms in america
so it s almost like they are trying to rehabilitate and not lock people up like animals
correct prison is not supposed to be punishment it is a chance to help a person amend their ways for some crimes other offenses you just need to look them up as some humans are incapable of being free
not only does the us provide horrific inhumane conditions while you are incarcerated they also want you to pay fines for staying there when you get out in order to keep you down
might come out of that cell rehabilitated
that s because their system is about reforming people for when they reenter society most other places are basically medieval punishment
treating humans like caged animals breeds more animals i firmly believe we need to have real and robust education opportunities for criminals to show them a better life is possible and fulfilling and toss the repeat offenders into the sausage machine
do prisoners act differently over there if you moved prisoners here into that everything that could be broken or disassembled would be and you would end up with half a dozen shives under the mattress
americans will be like my apartment isn t even that nice and not realize that their the ones getting fucked over
they focus on rehabilitation while america focuses on punishment they have very low recidivism rates
i have never lived anywhere this nice but i can leave any time i want so it s a trade off
the degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons fyodor dostoevsky
because they believe in rehabilitation and reintegration into society while in usa we just imprison people and make them used to that system
if we ran our prisons like this treating them with dignity instead of hostility we would probably end up with more people turning their lives around
of we had nice shit like that in american prisons the animals would destroy it either that or they would make weapons out of anything not made of steel or cement
that s how you reform people
introducing prysn by ikea
i m pretty sure this is just a dorm room display in an ikea
oh the humanity too humane for america
my hope is that one day a prison like this is introduced to the us and completely changes how we treat people in prison but that won t happen
the difference between focusing on rehabilitation and education compared to punishment and revenge
interesting what is the least victimless crime i can commit to get in there for a while asking for a friend
where s the hard sock
dude this is better than my college dorm
wonder what the crime rate is and the reincidente rate compared to murica
this is what i can afford for hotels in my job
you d pay this room p m in dublin
that s better then my fucking dorm room in uk
penitentiary actually comes from the word penitence where you were to reflect on what you had done wrong in us prisons you are not able to do that because of the environment they are put in hence you have a lot of recidivism
i hate so much that their literal prisons are nicer than the college dorm room i was forced to pay a semester to live in

this book is an icon of my childhood
i literally grew up with this book i am probably fine mostly
banned where
on my year olds book shelf haha
wtf shel silverstein is required reading in my house this is horrible
they ll ban the giving tree next as communist propaganda
i d definitely like to know the source shel silverstein sp was known as a humanitarian children s advocate also a little tidbit for redneck book burners he wrote johnny cash s song a boy named sue any info on where this is being banned
the missing piece was the book as a child i love that man
my grandma bought that one for me are we talking about the same book karens are so sensitive these days
i knew it was my mother who set me on the road to heavy metal
i like reading this book with some fava beans and a nice chianti
fuck it let s find reasons to ban all books green eggs and ham disrespects vegans and gmos where the wild things are promotes trans species red fish blue fish crt old yeller promotes killing the unvaccinated scary stories to tell in the dark biased against light therefore whites so crt again the diary of anne frank makes kids think the holocaust was real everybody poops gender biased because women don t poop hungry caterpillar fat shaming ugly duckling fugly shaming thumbelina pretends short people can be helpful big friendly giant no they are not goldilocks and the three bears a little girl should not be living with three large gay men keep it going people
elisa culpepper where ever you are thank you for reading some 2nd graders this book everyday
omg my favorite book when i was little this explains so much wait until i tell my therapist this explains so much
don t forget about that really scary picture on the front where the little kid has a window and a roof on his head
banning books is equivalent to banning imagination you can keep trying but that s not something you can control yet
ngl that s pretty fucking rock n roll should reread some shel silverstein one of these days
what the fuck my elementary school teacher read this to us
it was once banned by a florida school in not recently this is clickbait in its final form
is there an activist group in these states that follow this absurdly with proposing banning the bible in response you know to protect the kids i very much want to over subscribe and donate heavily to such a cause
banned i don t have the words to convey my disgust
banned for encouraging disobedience really mask off with these new laws huh
now this makes me fucking angry
good thing we got this for our first son that explains a lot if only we had known
what wow i still have nobody loves me and the twistable turnable man memorized shel got me into reading writing and drawing what a shame
tbf i almost died trying to turn my head into a house
you know what other book has all those things too the bible just saying
all the anti republican comments are hilarious it was banned by then democrat governor lawton chiles and by banned they mean temporarily removed from school libraries because of a couple intense poems in the book
source or is this click bait bullshit
you know what else encourages violence and suicide guns
damn republican snowflakes
banning things for no legitimate reason let me guess florida
i just want to point out that everyone commenting here is getting really fired up when we have no source information this is just a picture of a book with a handwritten post it note don t let other people control your emotions
it s banned because it doesn t say anywhere in it that white cisgender heterosexual is the only true path every book being banned is pretty much for the same reason my will desantis is even tackling the imaginary world of disney because there s not enough white heterosexuals who love god in them
the best part is everyone believing this this book is not banned someone intentional posted a half truth and you just went with it because you want to believe this is happening
you can hear him reading his own stuff on his youtube https://youtube.com/@shelsilversteinbooks) channel
homework oh homework i hate you you stink
yeah ok sure
please note a light in the attic the controversial poems https://www.booksontrial.com/light-attic-controversial-poems/) it was banned in a florida school in and challenged in other us schools throughout the 1980s and 90s because the poems were seen as promoting disobedience violence suicide satan and even cannibalism
this is a banned book display in a book store the ban happened in a school back in
banning this book offends my soul it breaks my heart for this country
the giving tree banned for being anti capitalistic and promoting socialism
banned not on my watch do what you want with your own kids i will teach mine to read
spoiler alert
my mom got my sister and i this book as kids and we absolutely loved it this is easily one of the least offensive books i ve ever read
god forbid children find solace in work that doesn t suit the norm don t joke about your feelings just pretend they don t exist
welcome to floriduh
so much nostalgia from those books i wish i still had my copies
i grew up with this book x200b out of ain t bad
haha my kids love this book
you should listen to some of his songs
i want to promote suicide for the people banning this stuff
burn it it s the only way to be sure s
thank god i found this here i was in the bookstore a couple months ago and i saw this on the banned end cap and i was very confused i understand now i don t agree with it but i now understand why it was there
shel silverstein also wrote extensively for playboy
i literally only know about this guy through diary of a wimpy kid
i used to loooove this book probably checked it out of the library at least times
just got copies delivered to my classroom paid for by my district in ca
we are going backwards
where is it banned they were reading this to us as a kid crazy
i love this book so do my kids
why shouldn t captain hook pick his nose one of my favorite poems man these dudes can fuck right off you know what s not banned mein kampf i wonder why that is that book makes me feel uncomfortable oh what i guess that doesn t matter
never a fan myself but going all out burn them all is kinda medieval nowadays
then pamela purse in that shrill bone of hers said ladies first
this book along with his many other publications were instrumental to my childhood
never noticed that the crooked smile looks like a skateboard
shel is amazing and a childhood hero this is ridiculous
shel silverstein is a badass i loved his books as a kid he also wrote a boy named sue
funny story i was very inspired to become a violently suicidal satan worshiping cannibal because of this book after reading it in 4th grade dark lord only knows how i might have turned out if not for that book
shel silverstein is the greatest he wrote a boy named sue for johnny cash he lived in the playboy mansion and was a regular cartoonist for the magazine for years i got to see a one man show of a performance of his long form poem the devil and billy markham years ago and it s still my favorite theatrical performance i ve ever seen i have one of his country albums downstairs the great train robbery some very fun songs his uncle shelby s abz book is still hilarious to me to this day shel silverstein is the best
turn on the dark i m afraid of the light i don t remember which one of those books it s from but it was my favorite poem back in 1st grade that s all i remember of it lol those were such great poems
this is what made emo kids
banned from what
true god bless that beautiful pervert they don t deserve him let them read the bible
what what the fuck
never heard of this book is there an actual reason it should be banned or is it florida being florida
things just ain t as good as they use to be
jfc get your hands off my shel silverstein one of my and my sons favorites a staple of my childhood i had a tape of the poems being read aloud when i was a kid that i bought for my son years ago
might as well be banning imagination silliness and creativity shel silverstein encompasses the childlike imagination children have before they grow up and get a firm grasp on reality a time when anything is possible to ban these books is just silly
great book i remember reading it as a kid
the greatness of silverstein s books was their ability to evoke critical thought in young children
all of his books are in my bookcase right now i remember them scaring me with some of the drawings but what
this was a book i had not read before can someone give me a quick and accurate synopsis about it because no way a childhood book actually promoted those things
we read where the sidewalk ends to year olds at a rural church camp in should i be worried s
why would americans think they are a free country
how does this book promote any of those things
did they ban scary stories to read in the dark cuz those were pretty fuckin scary considering they re children s books but to think about it i did like slasher films as a teen i mean i still do but i use to too
i don t see the bible in the picture
this and where the sidewalk ends love ya shel
i used to keep a piece of paper in the book with the page numbers of all my favorite poems
ooookay dahmer
i literally just finished reading this to my infant yesterday we re starting where the sidewalk ends tomorrow
i never read it why are they trying to ban it
mine too
except for the cannibalism
hail satan
i m not but not because of the book i think
probably florida
banned on sale in picture for
my and yr olds are massive silverstein fans
from this distant vantage point the earth might not seem of particular interest but for us it s different consider again that dot that s here that s home that s us on it everyone you love everyone you know everyone you ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives the aggregate of our joy and suffering thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilization every king and peasant every young couple in love every mother and father hopeful child inventor and explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt politician every superstar every supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam the earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner how frequent their misunderstandings how eager they are to kill one another how fervent their hatreds our posturings our imagined self importance the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe are challenged by this point of pale light our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark in our obscurity in all this vastness there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves the earth is the only world known so far to harbor life there is nowhere else at least in the near future to which our species could migrate visit yes settle not yet like it or not for the moment the earth is where we make our stand it has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character building experience there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world to me it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot the only home we ve ever known carl sagan pale blue dot
best thing i read today
goddard center https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goddard_space_flight_center) is a major nasa space research laboratory
nasa administrator bill nelson has named dr makenzie lystrup director of the agency s goddard space flight center in maryland effective immediately she will make history as the first female center director at goddard via prnewswire
this makes me happy i m going to stop here for the day so nothing ruins this feeling
this is so good it should be in r upliftingnews
i love it teenage boys often look for a guru and i m so glad i discovered sagan when i was young
i love this carl sagan forever

swearing on things is weird
just looking at this picture moved me to tears
should ve been the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy
on a moat of dust jacket
it s kind of silly to put your hand on any book when swearing an oath
as it should be
this made my heart so happy
just in time for ufo disclosure
how coooell is this
yeah well donald trump swore on a bible so blank stare
i d probably use a satanic bible or necronomicon or something
that s silly
brings me to tears every time

thank you
by extension it s just as humbling to realise that even if humanity managed to build a civilization that spanned our entire galaxy and that this civilization lasted until the heat death of the universe we would still be utterly insignificant
i went to high school across the street from the front gate at duval high school and i used to sometimes walk over there cause i wanted to believe i would see something amazing never did but it s cool to be able to say i know it well my grandfather brought our family to the area from ohio decades earlier to take a job at the nasa goddard campus as a biochemist i would find out years later
i am with you
yeah i am not sure what dr sagan would have thought of swearing on one of his books
suspended by subrina
swearing on a bible is silly to me
have you read the book it s a masterwork of accessible philosophy for a rational world view hail sagan
why john
why
it unites people more than any religion
shush fuckface
raising your hand is silly repeating after someone to swear anything verbally is silly it s all silly if you think about it too hard
it s not a comment on the quality of sagan s work but more about the act of swearing on a book at all like i get it s a joke but it s science and i ve always viewed the idea of swearing on a bible or any book to be a weirdly childish thing adults still do
see that s a good response someone thought one step past their instincts and went for the less obvious reply it s silly because it is silly it s a science dad joke which is fine
not op but i m not sure why we need a tradition of putting your hand on a book and raising the other hand it seems like a silly tradition to me just sort of a gesture that means nothing but if people want to do that more power to them put your hand on any book you want it doesn t affect me in any measurable way i just find it odd
it s the act not the content
fuck off nerd edit respectfully
i once swore an oath to my country the second i stepped foot overseas i m thinking this ain t for freedom or my constitution this shit fuckin lame
the block of posh flats next to where i used to work would have a falconer come to scare off the pigeons a few times a year the bloke used to show up in a range rover so it must have paid well

they cover their eyes to keep them calm and able to focus on their task they are very easily distracted or stressed by the things they see
i just met samuel last week
i was sitting on my balcony in cancun when a large bird of prey surprised the crap out of me by flying up and landing like two feet away from me it was one being used by the hotel like this as well thought it was cool as hell after changing my pants
in dubai they do the same to keep pigeons from shitting on the windows of that hotel that looks like a sail
i would like to have all my fries too
many years ago i was on a run with two friends and we stopped at a fancy waterfront resort to use the loo while there we saw a guy driving a golf cart with a hawk like this perched on his hand we talked about it for weeks coming up with all kinds of interesting scenarios for why he had the hawk this was not one of our ideas but makes perfect sense
they also do this at the waldorf astoria cavalieri in rome i found it odd that they didn t clear the tables from the night before and the pigeons and hawks were destroying glasses
pinches gaviotas a la verga cabrones
toronto s airport uses hawks as well to keep the birds from flying into engines
this is also common on the east coast of the united states source i have visited the new jersey shore every summer for my entire years on this earth and they use hawks on the boardwalks to deter seagulls seagulls will not interfere in the territory of a predatory bird at least that s the explanation i have been given i am sure it is more complicated than that
it makes sense seagulls taking french fries from kids ceases to be an issue when there are no longer kids
he s so cute what a good little sport
they use them at niagara falls as well
how much are the hawks earning are they unionized
thank you for your service
that chicken is on drugs
is gulls stealing kid s food suddenly become an international menace we just had a story here in denmark about it and municipalities hiring hunters to shoot gulls i feel like birds of prey would be a much better solution
that s so cool i met that lady a few years back with another bird at our resort she said that they have a bird rescue and this is part of the training for rehabbing the birds it s a family run operation i can t for the life of me remember the name of it but i sent them some money as a donation
man if i got to see this takeout a seagull while at a resort on vacation i would not only leave a star review but i would make alt accounts to leave several star reviews
the president has one too
that s actually a pretty clever idea
i have so many mixed feelings about this i love fries but i don t like captive birds but i also got harassed by seagulls as a kid but i also find kids annoying such an emotional rollercoaster
marival in puerto vallarta had a hawk on the premises as well really cool experience for the kids to go talk to the handler and meet the hawk
they have birds of prey at wimbledon each year
they do this in vegas too very cool to watch
how much does he charge
i saw one and its handler at my resort this year i thought they were there to keep the mouse population down the resort also had cats loose on the property mostly they lay in the sun or shade and people were petting them
based samuel
my office has this
they need this at the jersey shore went down last year and had a seagull rip food from brother in law s hands the seagulls there are so bold and unchallenged that they don t give a fuck about anyone they need to larn
throwing fries at the seagulls was half the fun of going to the beach
king s cross in london also hires falcons to deter the pigeons when you re stuck in the station for hours they are a very enjoyable way to spend time
dude was this at the intercontinental cancun
that s awesome but ummmmmm songbird https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/songbird)
that s great but is this guy stopping the coati from taking my fruit plate
now if only they hired cops to keep the cartel from my avocados
the john wick of birds
that helmet looks badass
samuel don t fucking call me sam hawk holy shit is that a great name dibs don t take no shit from any man woman or small child and certainly never from some punk ass seagulls
if only i d know in house falconer at mexican resort was a valid answer to what is your dream job i wouldn t have tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid student loans
newer to florida and our first trip to the beach about to give a chip to a cute bird my wife is like don t i m looking around thinking who the fuck is she scolding someone fucked up eyes meet i m starting to say something i m absolutely positive is going to fuck up this vacation and yet the sound begins she s smart jumps right in and explains that if i feed them i am now their bitch i m looking like aw come on she s like yeah your bitch suddenly a dumber guy did what you can guess the best i can call it is a bird jumping in to a gang but that accosting stops every day back to the beach they found him vacation saved by my wife that saved me from myself
if that badass does such a service i wouldn t mind giving him a fry lmao
what in the actual fuck
at the cape of good hope in south africa we visited a restaurant that had to hire guards with tazer sticks to fight off all the baboons running around the restaurant had to put barbed wire around the roof because the baboons would sit on the roof wait for tourists to sit down at a table with food and then jump down on the table and scream and the tourists would run and the baboon got all the food we also met another swedish girl at the airport that was covered in scratches and cuts and bandages it was gnarly she told us she was also at the cape and she had some candy in her pocket and a baboon smelled it and mauled her to get to the candy
so basically he s like an avian bouncer
ocean city new jersey s had raptors on the boardwalk the last few summers
the seattle seahawks start games by having a hawk come flying out of the tunnel and around the field then back to her guy her name is taima which means thunder and she is an augar hawk
have you heard anything about hawks and keepers working full time around airports they actually exist and do a lot of work
hires
keeps them calm in crowds i believe
trainer looks sadge
yeah we vacationed in cancun a couple years ago and the resort had one as well they keep the other birds out and you ll see their handlers walking around for a picture with the bird though
i live near lake michigan a few years back a lakeshore city was experiencing a seagull nuisance problem thousands of the birds flocked the waterfront and most of the city and making a mess of things the city tried a number of deterrents city employees chasing them bringing in dogs to chase them setting off cannons to scare them nothing worked then in spite of protests from some animal lovers the city brought in sharpshooters to start killing them the gulls practically vanished overnight once they learned that they were under threat of actual death if they stuck around nothing less than that will work on gulls
i saw this in person the last time i was down there it s funny because samuel gets off at and the other birds know it or at least that was the case where i was
i ve always heard in mexico your job in the tourism industry is based off your ability to speak english i wonder where falconer is on that spectrum
that hawk looks like dios hawk from jojo part
i d show up in a ford falcon
rolling up to the gig with my falcon homies getting paid eating well
they need to get one out to liberty island i had to guard my fries very closely as there was a seagull hovering ft over my shoulder the entire time waiting for any opening it was actually kinda impressive how the seagull maintained its position in the strong winds to hover for so long above me
something tells me that falconry isn t typically a poor man s sport in the uk
i was just thinking recently about how bad seaguls are in the uk and how people can t kill them because they are migratory someone should set lose a bunch of hawks they will go nuts there
just seeing a falcon is enough to scare off a bunch of birds and they stay away for weeks that s incredible
we have a falconer that works for us in canada doing the same thing he just slowly drives through the developments with his bird chilling on the roof
or he s just in debt lol
samuel also likes fries samuel is biding his time samuel is eliminating the competition
removed
airport wildlife biologist here i ll be training as a falconer in may it s going to be awesome we also have drones and dogs to help disperse wildlife to protect aircraft
a hawk clearly cannot carry that kind of weight it s physically impossible i think you are thinking of a swallow
just use a drone like the cartels dude yeesh
does it deter scrumpers or just seagulls

get out no way
you might ve met sam
they are just all around a pest
his owner rescued him from a zoo in mexico he was pulling out all his feathers and now is the love of her life living healthy part of her family now
one pretty big difference between wild and domesticated animals is their ability to take care of themselves if that falcon decided to just take a seagull and go live somewhere else there s crap all we could really do about it they re conditioned definitely arguably tamed too but it s hard to say that bird spends all of its time captive i say that not because i doubt it sleeps in a cage but because i m happy it gets the salt air and the thrill of the hunt every day
not much yet he needs to prove his worth seems like he was just winging it
royalton just down the road i believe
awesome and awesomely written story

but do you get spaghettified if you get too close to the center
burning man is like skiing now a rich persons endeavor
galaxy
it should be stated that this is burn night and not every night all the art cars and everybody on foot gathers around the man to watch him burn there are like days of partying before this happens and one more night of temple burn after this which is very sober in comparison i went in for the first time and by this night burn night the days were all blurred together like some kind of endless experience it felt like being in a circus it was unforgettable and i wish everyone could experience how wonderful this place is for the nights straight after burning man was finished i had vivid dreams nightmares about being there nothing has ever done that to me before or since then i loved it a lot of people think it s stupid and that it s just all drugs and partying but i met completely sober folk there and had some of the best laughs of my life just hanging out and riding bikes in the dust if you are thinking about going do it
this is the only picture i ve seen that made burning man look cool
how much does it cost now
on stubhub tickets are a real steal at to each for a week pass i think stacks of dollar bills must be the kindling for that fire
i ll stick with fyre festival

jwst is getting some unbelievable shots
wait so there s like a man burning right at the center of it
burning man went the way of coachella a long time ago and honestly it s just become a massive pollution event at this point if you want to do something closer to the original intent of the event find your local burn chapter and go to one of their events you ll know real quick if true burner culture is your vibe
fuck that
i can t imagine being loaded on drugs trying to navigate through that to get back to my friends campsite while tripping and there s no wifi on top of that so your phone is useless
what s in the middle
i wonder how many much drugs contained within that photo
looks like fun remind me to go before i die
so which elden ring boss has this attack again
ah yes burning man where rich white dudes go to live like homeless people
looks like an excess of capitalism
okay as a european festival fan who would probably really like to go there and who doesn t know too much about it why all the hate what s bad about it
what if the universe is just a dope ass festival for aliens
is there another hippy festival that s more lowkey burning man sounds fun but the high ticket prices and overcrowding make it sound too stressful
this festival is a scam went there and saw no burning men
looks just like the city everyone was running from
damn i went in and and again in and and it wasn t this though it was definitely more this in the 00s than it was in the 90s i m sure it s still a great time but this little perfectly circular patch of desert trapped in a closed ring of humanity feels completely wrong to me i remember having to mindful though i was wasted out of my mind when i roamed to playa not to wander off too far into the dark or maybe i m just an old man waving my fist at a cloud
if you zoom in close enough you can see grover norquist

burning man is not a festival
when the aliens make first contact it will be at burning man
my issue with burning man is how awful for the environment it is all that power is coming from fossil fuels everytime bm ends there s a mountain of trash to clean up how many private jets fly into town every year just for bm it may have started as an expression of love but these days it s an expression of gluttony

are there reliable sources of water there
i thought this was a picture of the known universe for a second
who says we stopped dancing around a fire at night after we stopped being cavemen
that s be funny if all these distant galaxies we are seeing are just burning man events
this is huuuge
how do they generate power to run all the lights and stuff do people bring their own generators
i gave up on that bullshit star child cult but sometimes i wonder
wait a minute i just finished the episode of malcolm in the middle where they go to burning man are you telling me that s not how it really is and it s more like a gigantic circus of light

ive sat on that front row twice great times if you have a chance to go you should

which of the men did they burn
what is someplace i ll never want to go to for alec
this was from i performed conclave that year it s still wild to look at this and realize i m technically in it
god at this point this is the largest monument to the highest concentration of boomer energy in my eyes i never had a desire to visit this hedonistic hellscape but now that it clearly is no longer about what it started as i d rather celebrating self reliance and leave no trace in actual nature not surrounded by self centered yuppies
i literally thought this was a space thing guys
jesus christ burning man got corporate
the land of posers
nice pic
i have heard about burning man for almost years now that picture is the opposite of what i imagined there is too much symmetry an order for a festival of radical inclusion
i have no idea what goes on at the festival but i wanna go
as above so below
it s like eve online but with even more accountants
reminds me of homeworld just not quite in 4d
reminds me of a lesion
totally thought this was a modded stellaris galaxy
looks a little like geometry wars somewhat
ask the guy who ran into the center of it several years ago
you get taken down

and it s not a photo it s an oil painting hanging over a billionaires fireplace edit https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qoslihkrzru
here https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow) provides the following caption a painting that hangs at camp topridge shows crow far right and thomas second from right smoking cigars at the resort they are joined by lawyers peter rutledge leonard leo and mark paoletta from left credit painting by sharif tarabay here https://i.imgur.com/grdnlw2.jpg) is an image of that painting here https://brewstercreative.com/illustration-work/6013-2/) is the source of this painting that was done by sharif tarabay a montreal based illustrator according to here https://mobile.twitter.com/mattzeitlin/status/1643969756159148034) this painting hangs in camp topridge new york
for decades justice clarence thomas has secretly accepted luxury trips from a major republican donor newly obtained documents and interviews show the extent and frequency of these apparent gifts to thomas has no known precedent in modern scotus history
nope nothing wrong with this picture clarence thomas
the more i learn about this guy the more i realize our political leaders are morally bankrupt i want to believe we will make the necessary changes to save our democracy but we may already be doomed it s a small club and we ain t in it
oh come on it s probably just an innocent legal retreat where they are discussing the grave concerns of everyone s genitals s
clarence thomas okay guys which one of you can outbid the other for my services again
bohemian grove
scalia used to go on luxury hunting trips paid for by lobbyists it helped him to deliberately misinterpret the second amendment by omitting a clarifying part of the original text
guy has really embraced the one of the good ones role his entire life
i m not sold on term limits in general but i do think their time has come for the scotus these people start to believe they re untouchable pharaohs and it s ridiculous that an incompetent compromised and corrupt asshole like thomas should have a life term make it years make it years whatever but lifetime appointments are a farce
and republicans won t say shit because they re the biggest god damn hypocrites on the planet every argument is an argument in bad faith from them they don t give a fuck about anything aside from having more power even at the expense of democracy and human lives it s fucking pathetic and i m sick of it
it s going to be hilarious when the catholics go to war with the evangelicals
never seen a bigger group of dorks in my life
the fact it s a bunch of white guys using the black guy for their own personal benefit under the statue of a native american that looks like he s waiting to raptured to heaven is simply too much to process the fact it s a painting to boot is jesus
why else do you think people want these jobs
have the trial even if r s don t convict put the corruption front and center
it s impossible to believe these people believe themselves crow has said in a nutshell it s all ok because clarence and gini thomas didn t ask for any of these luxuries and crow says it s ok because no lobbying took place so you have a group of very well known ultra right wing folks chatting about what they need to see happen in front of a guy with the ability to make it happen who just happens to be getting luxury treats he could never otherwise afford you can picture any scene from any mafia movie where the don says it would be a shame if this or that legislation happened because there d be big cuts to vacation spending lesser folks who have contracted with the government know this is massively corrupt there are very very clear guidelines that gini and clarence have ignored at this stage we should all stop believe this is a functional democracy we are a massively corrupt society that gets what the rich decides we can have
quick someone post this in r conservative i would but i got perma banned yesterday already
how is this even legal
bought and paid for what a nice supreme court we got stuck with every vote is so important we have to use our votes instead of throwing them away by not voting
i am sure they never talked about politics s
impeach
can t wait for the mental gymnastics from the nazis at r conservative to try explaining how this is a good thing
what an absolute piece of shit he is
it s time to begin the impeachment proceedings
that statue i can t even
was this the same billionaire s place where scalia died
he s not accepted in that group if he s not a judge
i think this picture illustrates why they say clarence thomas is really uncle thomas he is a person who betrays his own people by participating in their oppression and he did so willingly
when are we going to stop pretending that supreme court judges are apolitical lol
all legal truly representing the will of the people is impossible with current campaign finance laws legalizing corruption like this
he is a pig
is it just me or is it incredibly off putting that they re setting with an indian motif as the backdrop we basically robbed the indians and they re chilling on the loins lol they don t know how disgusting they are
clarence and ginnie are an embarrassment what a banana republic we are to accept this corruption
where are these info wars qanon douches screaming about his bohemian grove trips
it s wild to me that it took decades for this to come to light thomas has been photographed in public multiple times wearing polos with a logo of the billionaire s yacht that he was riding around on
if you want to find out more about why thomas is the way he is i recommend the behind the bastards podcast series about him it s a real eye opener
clarence bigsby
impeach him now fucking traitor
it s not like we didn t already know calrence thomas is an absolutely horrible excuse for a human and has no place being on or anywhere near any courthouse let alone the supreme court biggest joke of the century
impeachable
i think the name of this painting is called the enlarge prostate super pact

what s it like being the uncle tom at the highest level no way they see him as equal
of all the money and power in this photo you would think they could afford better shoes
the league of evil
feels like a scene from that mark wahlberg movie shooter
the common denominator is always greed or laziness if you want to break it down animal kingdom style a cow will always take the shortest path to water and billionaires will leverage that for their own personal gain greed the only way to fix it is to redesign the system to incentivize good and to make that system so e every efficient that it is adopted by animal nature we are on it just keep reporting the shit players names and places help
can we get a backstory here i mean i dont like the guy at all don t get me wrong but it s just some guys smoking cigars outside in the woods with a supreme court justice to me hes allowed leisure time aside from being a mouthpiece and token for the far right
republicans will never let their token black guy take a fall what absolute corruption just another line item in the downfall of america
impeach this prick now
clarence thomas probably yes i do believe the 14th and 15th amendments should be repealed they fundamentally changed what the founding fathers intended for this country and by the way slavery was a perfectly legitimate way of insuring costs of goods stayed low
what all the others don t do the same thing
so much wealth and power so much bitch and assness
who wants to bet that s an illegal cuban cigar
thomas and a cabin
can we get a big hard irs probe up clarence and ginny s financial ass
they don t even care it s a big to everyone
the black friend every racist tells you about
looks like a rad time
i ain t gonna lie it looks like a fun ass vacation
they re all for sale including our administration
are folks saying this oil painting is evidence that ct was there in that location with those people if so oil paintings are not proof of much maybe it happened maybe it didn t painting itself proves nothing in any case did rbg stop hanging out with liberal lawyers from aclu splc etc and other liberals when she was on the court i believe i have seen photos of her socializing with out of office clintons and or out if office obamas but i may be mistaken legitimately asking because i don t know what s the standard
let s go grim
god what an uncle rockus
and all of them are thinking we got this old n right where we want him
at least it wasnt on epstein island
amazing his racist compatriots are able to put aside their issues to join together in fucking over america
they ve read the sen bob menendez playbook
holy shit this is a nice painting
this pile of crap loves being the token black man amongst the white folk
anyone with the title of gop mega donor has to be the worst of the worst scum bag vulture extraordinaire
if that statue fell and killed all those people the world would be a better place
goddamn this image is just terrible from the men sitting around plotting to the statue centered in the background what a bunch of criminals
judge has rich friends who knew
all i have to say is what are those to every pair of shoes in the painting
i too prefer my never gonna fix it corruption hanging on my mantle take that little people
anyone know what kind of cigar that is so we can judge his character
idk not my kind of luxury
genuine question are supreme court justices not meant to have political opinions like yeah no shit the guy is a very strong republican but like are there not supreme court justices that are very strong democrats
so i guess all subs are turning into pro whatever political party sad
i am sure no liberals would ever dream of taking nice vacations with friends whatever
if you join the supreme court historical society you can buy access to the justices
finally something goes well for the dems lol
they all do it it just depends whether it is time to go after people or not all these politicians are crooked our system has not worked for the people for a long time
the point is what
fuck off where d biden spend his last holiday
where s the proof
luxurious
looks like a midjourney generated image
a bunch of kids trying out the latest cool expensive toy they just bought
it s harmless this is just their fantasy football draft
just bought and paid for dudes being bought and paid for bros
praise the sun sweet sunbro statue
how luxurious
ok but points at shoes what are thooossse
sold his soul to smoke a cigar with old white dudes
the lack of self awareness is breathtaking
trying his best to raise kids who will be unemployable it s okay though because he ll be able to blame democrats immigrants and gays for ruining their livelihood nope it certainly wouldn t be the fact that he raised them to disengage with society and education at an early age and to invest themselves in conspiracy theories and blind anger
r trashy
great family values
is this grooming
the dad probably high fives his son when he looks up little girls dresses and punishes him if he loses a fight
sadly no amount of hypocrisy from them surprises me anymore
i think of the guy that said let s go brandon on a call with the president right after the president had wished his kids a merry christmas
damn what a sad and pathetic life when your political view is your whole identity personality just a waste of evolution
i m guessing that he s against higher education
time to introduce my daughters to my favorite red blooded american pastime degrading women those darn liberals sure hate it when i do that
protecting kids is the lie they use to cover the truth it s about controlling others abortion is bad when women choose it but fine when hersehel walker did it its bad when liberals do something and a kid might see it but when republicans do its fine
is this kid rock s family reunion
well its only grooming when the other guys do it
totally not groomers
a divorced dad with kids fuck s sake
ya fuck the fuck biden sign
hahahaha class act
this pic deserves to be in r trashy
all i hear is we don t take kindly to your type around here
ah i see the groomers are busy
it s always some fat idiots with pairs of irish twins that you see rolling into walmart in their clapped out van using their ebt to buy food while they spend their paycheck on cigs and booze but yeah it s the mexicans that are taking your job
gotta teach em to hate young
those poor kids honestly i d be wary of any dude who has young daughters and thinks of women like he probably does yeah i know i m probably generalizing and not every asshole is a pedo but projecting is real and it seems like there s a lot of projecting going on in that party these days that and i grew up around a pos like that who i know molested kids because i was one of them so sorry if i m a little biased they talk a big game till they re behind closed doors and free to be a monster
reminds of of parks and rec when those vegans used exotic dancers to sell their shitty veggies at the farmers market
the call is coming from inside the house how hard is it for people to get republicans are trying to blame drag queens and gay people for something that they themselves are actively doing they re sending the general public on a wild goose chase so they don t actually see what s right in front of them which is religious conservatives regularly assaulting children and getting away with it
let me guess traditional values isn t grooming
family values trailer trash edition
thats pretty stupid yea
as long as it s heterosexual stuff it s ok them probably
this is perfectly ok but drag queens are somehow not
i d say i m more right leaning than left and this disgusts me
you can see hetero woman ass but not a fully clothed drag queen makes perfect sense s
grooming the next generation of daddy issues
the girl flipping off the camera is a liberal lol
good old christian morality
conservatives and hypocrites go together like conservatives and nazi or conservative and terrorist or conservative and pedophile
i m no pro at asl but i m pretty damn sure that s not how the middle finger gesture works
we are so f d
well these are actual women dressed as nympho slags you see so it s ok
not a single redeeming quality
family of nazis
i am a conservative republican and i find this absolutely disgusting what kind of father does this i really wish that these types of people would stop destroying the image of our party
yea these people are gross as well how is this confusing
man as someone who s mostly in the middle on most issues i m so sick of both parties
fuck both sides get rid of the two party system that wants to divide us
now replace those thong women with men dressed as women
my kind of party
still better then gender affirming care
isn t this site tired of just being an echo chamber all this post does is make us look hypocritical
seen this kind of trash from both dems and republicans
i don t get the point of this post besides op trying to get people to rage upvote rage for what i see nothing wrong with this pic you trying to say they should be more conservative with their clothing
while this is ridiculous kids see so much worse on the internet and tv but in person will always be worse
i don t see the difference between this and taking your children to drag shows they re both wrong
i am confused by this post are you angry that they are not conservative enough
there s always a few bad eggs i m just sad we keep blaming the parties for these bad eggs and this goes for each side
to act like its only one party faults is cool
poor kids
wow i just saw these girls on the strip yesterday
but hey they re white and presumably straight so it s all good
maybe they mean it literally
they are aware they just think that women are objects property
what are you talking about those girls at least see their career paths to either side of them
so it s trashy when the right does it but when the left does it it s empowering
or indoctrination i hear that s a thing
it s gay to hug your son so wtf else is he supposed to do fella
and biden was super grandpa about it too lol gave him the ol what was that son or some shit i can t remember exactly it was close to that tho i m not a huge biden fan simply because i don t think anyone that old and potentially out of touch with modern society needs to be president but he s a damn sight better than ol donny the diddler i was a bernie supporter myself but we all see how that went sucks when the only guy who seems to legit have integrity and the want to change things for the better isn t popular enough to win the popularity contest shit needs to change i m not even sure we need a president these days it s an antiquated position that doesn t coincide with our current actual reality imo as are many other aspects of our government
i m guessing that his father right is against higher education i m foretelling that his five present daughters become incredible civil rights activists as it is my wish good luck and best wishes children the world is out here to embrace you when ready the son may be nurtured by his sisters or not i couldn t say i hope he learns sooner than later that women will rule his life and he better get better at dealing with it ahead of others for his sake
that s woke s
the abortion rate remains the same for both conservatives and liberals conservatives just lie about it

ironically the mods banned me https://i.imgur.com/scsyiv8.jpg) for trying to post it it s trashy but i guess they don t think so

because conservatives haven t made any attempt to legislate against it like they have with trans people hypocrisy can be confusing
most of the democrats in office are moderates who are willing to compromise both sides is a gop psyop
i swear both sides has got to be the new platform for right wingers lol it s half of all i hear from you all anymore i m waiting for a republican to campaign on it
r iam14andthisisdeep
if you did that conservatives would want you thrown in jail though
that s that s the point
isn t this site tired of just being an echo chamber member for years i mean i guess you must like it lol sorry dude
as a parent i was not happy to see my children flip the bird at random strangers or while a photo was being taken i don t care about your political ideology but teaching your children that there are times when it is appropriate to flip someone off is just bad parenting they are being taught that it is ok to hate for no other reason than daddy hates the guy and even he probably can t articulate what it is he hates thinking is important this is just stupid hateful
the entirety of the anti drag argument is centered around protecting children from sexualized content this appears to qualify wouldn t you say also let s dispense with the rage upvote nonsense some things when you see them if you have a consistent moral compass should make you mad that s ok hearing or seeing injustice and getting mad about it is what used to be considered good in the idealized version of what an american should be
ever heard of this thing called hypocrisy it s a huge trend among conservative types let me make this easy for you the same people who see educating their child on lgbtq representation as grooming and the very same people who don t see this as grooming
you think adults should show their butts to kids for the sake of political rallying idk seems kind of hypocritical here to not see any problems with this based on current conservative rhetoric
the point is the entire i just want to protect kids bullshit lately is well bullshit
i could already tell the comments would be wild was not disappointed
i m not sure a kind under sees ass shorts and the word fuck on the internet or tv
do you think the women holding up that sign should be arrested
what kind of drag shows do you think people are taking their kids to if you don t see the difference then i think you need to at least do the slightest bit of research into what drag storytime actually is before forming an opinion on it
no i m sure that man is plenty conservative
when the bad eggs hold political office and speak on the floor that trans people are a danger to children i think we can blame the party only one party does this please don t try to excuse them
crazy that a group of people are intentionally electing bad eggs
the irony of those two shrimps
her name is phoebe which is a nod to its scientific name phoenicopterus roseus

fun fact the most yolks ever found in one single egg was nine you can even purchase a whole dozen that s specifically all double yolks
i ve never seen that much oil used to cook eggs before
triples makes it safe
usa is going to invade you for that much oil
aw triples
with that much oil you could join opec
did you buy them in east palestine ohio
trifecta or hat trick
grammar people is this post correct or is it i never saw this before or i never have seen this before
congrats the universe wave function has decided between two low odds things to occur it was either winning the lottery or three yolks in an egg the wave function collapsed and chose the egg thank you please play again
i ve never seen a lake of oil used to cook eggs before either holy shit son just put a nice light glaze of butter and call it a day
i shared this post in r metroid hope you don t mind

you may choose to not believe me but i had a whole carton of double yolked eggs once there s a picture somewhere of some of them
i had a box of a dozen eggs not long ago in which all but one egg was double yolk
oh those are eggs most likely chicken eggs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xllbstp0c_u
looks like there goes all your luck for the next months
where are you people buying all these super eggs i want in on it
in million that s the chances of a triple yolker apparently
worked at mcdonalds for years cracked probably tens of thousands of eggs only ever saw doubles once in a while
i have seen eggs before they are plenty at the supermarket
i just remembered this video https://youtu.be/d7meju2pyfq
it s an egg
i have it s not an uncommon occurrence with eggs
what s going on with all that oil you only need a touch or a tiny bit of butter
use more oil op gif giphy umkiqo1i6dyl7ixpby downsized
you never saw this before or you have never seen this before i seen is never correct
it s time to go vegetarian
i think they re called eggs birds poop them out or something

i have you just seperate yolks and add them to one egg for internet karma you should try it
triplets
triplets you cheater
wow i ve seen double yolks but never triple yolks in one egg
my man never saw eggs before gif emote free_emotes_pack sob
i had this happen occasionally when i had chickens the egg was huge
sweet eggs for the price of one back in

oh baby a triple
minecraft chicken right there
those a chicken eggs you are welcome in advance
if it s not soaked in oil it s not good that guy probably
reminded me of that scene in the music man where harold hill asks you remember the pitch what can i use what s new around here and marcellus washburn responds the other day a farmer brought in an egg had yolks in it was in the paper
that was added in the most recent update to the simulation
r glitchinthematrix
when i get eggs from my friends chickens they always have double yolks for some reason
yeah that s a lot of oil
there are called eggs and come from chickens
triple kill
these are fried eggs most probably coming from birds
congratulations it s triplets i mean was triplets
if you are going to drown your food in oil at least let it heat up first
what a cup of cold oil for cooking eggs _
i feel terrible but once i cracked eggs in a row with yolks each i had not bought anything new or special threw it all away cause i was like fuck no i don t want cancer lol
i ve
one time i cracked eggs and they all came together like that
angry metroid noises
that is to say you never saw it
do you plan on drinking the oil once the eggs are done that s the only thing that makes sense
oh baby it s a triple
are these being cooked directly on the stovetop
if a double yolk egg is fertilized do two chicks hatch or is the egg top small
found a hidden mickey
probably never seen the feedstocks for factory hens either but here you are
poor chicken she was in a foursome
as ramsay once said there s so much oil in this pan usa wants to invade it
because you cheated and put yolks in to get likes
i hope that s not canola oil

no clear her name she was scapegoated by wicked people of her time
fun fact while she did claim to be of south east asian descent to some of her partners notably mile tienne guimet she was in fact frisian which is a subsection of dutch mostly descendent from the english and had no indian asian heritage at all
mata hari was a courtesan who became a scapegoat when the french couldn t succeed in being of se asian heritage was part of the act she was a performer
cheese
she was killed by a french firing squad for being a german informant this is a real person well was
seriously it s good enough to be made into a painting
frisian is not descendent from english it is the closest linguistically but it is not descendent frisian is part of the north sea germanic group which also involved the ancestor languages of english anglo saxon and jute
she lived in indonesia from to was interested in indonesian and indian culture and visited performances of the mahabharata en ramayana she also joined a local dance group
for whatever reason i thought she was polish thanks for making me look it up
boobs butts the savory bits
gorgeous
it s great as a photograph too a painting is not necessarily the next step up from a photograph
you re welcome
this is truly beautiful thank you for sharing this
no worries people do sometimes describe a photograph as having painterly qualities i don t mind that so much and i d say this photograph is like that

biggest problem in subcontinent
can confirm i tried not to but they made me do it anyway now i have bills and no serotonin
i can vouch i hate being an adult
and never leave home you won t like what you see
the alternative to growing up isn t a picnic
being an adult isn t always easy but i don t think i d trade it to be a child again i like the freedom to do what i want eat what i want and buy what i want without having to be dependent on my parents
love it
excellent advice
seriously nobody told me that i d have to clean dishes and wash laundry forever until i die and then they throw madeup crap at you like getting an oil change and we re supposed to know what that is
i don t know the american school system seems to have embraced it
the alternative is the s word
i d work a and pay bills over taking a bat to the knee for jesus any day
when you get older then doing the dishes manually becomes one of those moments you can actually relax and reflect even or maybe especially when you have a dishwasher for years while doing the dishes you try to remember oh did they change the oil or not you also realize that font size 6pt totally lost its benefit
my daughter told us about the gun protest walkout at her school today approximately students of nearly participated
i was in a walkout to end obesity i m still fat though guess i didn t walk far enough
imma be real most everyone in this picture is smiling like crazy i think they just hate school for every reason not just gun violence
this happened at my school too abt of the kids i knew did it to get out of class i m also not really sure what it was supposed to do lol i mean how is a couple kids walking out of school for half a day even changing anything
man do you know hard it is to get teenagers to skip school
i bet that really showed all those pro gun violence teachers s
high school kids are always on board when a walkout s involved
best we can do is thoughts and prayers
we had a walkout our kids couldn t be bothered to make a single flyer poster they all just went home one kid even returned and asked if he could just go back to school because i realized i don t have anything to do
the smiles what a good time they re having
shoulda held a sit in after school and see how many cared enough to stay bet there wouldn t be soo many giggling faces in that picture
better than a shootout against walk violence i guess
this is just an excuse to leave school haha who is in favor of gun violence besides criminals
i m and this is deep
now we can go home and play cod
i remember doing walkouts in middle school to protest the war after i so wish i had kept my picket sign it said drop books not bombs
it s over guys they did it
awfully lot of laughing and smiling going on seems like more happy just to be able to go outside instead of sitting in class
protesting against gun violence is completely useless of course normal people don t like gun violence of normal people aren t going to commit mass shootings and the very little amount who do shoot up a school don t give a fuck about what you are doing
let s be honest of the kids participating are just happy to be getting away with leaving school
i m probably going to get crap for this but how about a protest to end all violence in schools get rid of the reasons for these people to want to come back and shoot the places up a few years ago i saw all kinds of anti bullying stuff posted it was probably after columbine but lately there have been a ton of bullying videos posted bullying against teachers teachers bullying students students bullying other students for all kinds of different reasons all these manifesto s that these killers are leaving state at some point how they felt bullied and or marginalized in some way by someone why does no one put the blame on where it belongs the laws need to be changed back to where the bullies are actually punished not the people who try to stop the bullying
you did it you solved the violence by checks notes walking out of class
yay no homework
and all around the world criminals put up their guns cuz students walked
they just wanna get out of class that s it
and nothing was accomplished
this had very little to do with gun violence and everything to do with getting out of school kids are stupid
something about the two laughing chads holding ap stat screams they just wanted out of class lmao
this is stupid
students don t typically recognize the power they have enjoy the experience and don t lose sight of the strength in unity and soon y all be able to vote
gun violence what kind of violence was the boston strangler rope violence
i m pretty sure are against gun violence so it doesn t really make sense to protest something that the overwhelming majority of people are already against
yep this is gonna do something haha
wtf is that gonna do
basically everyone just left school to leave this walk out achieved nothing
we used to do this back in the day one guy started a walk out when that dude made the video under the sheets crying and screaming leave brittany alone he made leave brittany alone signs and handed them out i joined in because i wanted to smoke a cigarette across the street decent protest would smoke another cigarette again
some look like they wanted a way out of class
yeah don t address the bullying or anything that leads to shootings just the guns obviously only people who legally obtained guns commit crimes with guns and no one will ever break the law to acquire a gun to commit a crime
itt people who have never gone to protests complaining that collective action can be enjoyable
what does protesting gun violence even mean
this seems more about kids finding a reason to leave class than them being against gun violence
i don t think people who are shooting up schools give a fuck about protests
defend yourselves at all times by encouraging citizens to own something that can stop a would be shooter in their tracks bring me to hades redditors
aka a fun way to cut class
everyone is universally against gun violence i don t think that is what you should be protesting you should be protesting elected officials who refuse to do anything about it
we held protests all the time it was called skipping school
walking out in the open makes you easier targets at least where camo next time
looks like a normal skip day to me
go jackets
is it just me or is there nowhere near enough room on this paper to write out violence considering how big that was written the end of that sign had to look like shit https://i.imgur.com/xzqz5iu.jpg
i m just confused what the point of this is its your education you need to learn and get ready for the future if you walk out i think politicians don t see it as a protest but more like okay go ahead ruin your own future i mean i get the point but i don t regard this as a protest really and i don t think politicians will either
never too young to learn peaceful protests accomplish nothing
i wonder if they teach gun violence stats in ap statistics
make gun violence illegal enough
we did this at my school years ago more dead kids no new laws
probably just happy to have a reason to bail from school lol
i remember my school did something similar back in either or about of the student body walked out then a couple weeks later a conservative group of students came up with a freedom walkout that while not explicitly pro gun everyone knew it was a counter protest to the last walkout with that walk out once again of the student body participated and probably of those who did also participated in the anti gun walkout idk if it was the conservative kids plan to show that most of the students who walked out just wanted to get out of class for a bit and didn t give a shit about the protest but if so they succeeded at least i got to chill out in an empty classroom and screw around on my phone for about a half hour both times they did their walkouts
everyone so happy
kids skip school more at
all those criminals pay attention
who is for gun violence
lol
did it work
gun control now way past time to end this bullshit
bahahahha taking away guns won t change a thing that s like taking mary j from a stoner they will just find a way
protest against gun violence warning long as in protesting against people using guns to commit murder that s already illegal maybe you mean protesting school and government officials who didn t follow their own rules or knew someone had a gun but didn t do anything that would be a good thing to protest maybe you re protesting against the 24x7 in your face coverage on news sites and social media sites including reddit where i got to see the murderer s texts to their friend in a reddit post something i did not appreciate the existence of of mass shootings because that s also a good thing to protest if we didn t make stars of these monsters and their horrific deeds others wouldn t seek to emulate them potentially for clout are you protesting against your own once you re old enough right to keep and bear arms it s your first amendment right to do that but be careful what you wish for let s say you succeed and get the us constitution amended to nullify the second amendment what happens the next time there are protests like the blm protests of i m not talking about riots i m talking about https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/20/us/portland-protester-navy-veteran-beaten/index.html) protests https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/21/portland-protest-navy-vet-christopher-david-beaten-federal-agents-video/5477552002/).) two references to the same story lots of people were beaten by the police and all kinds of weapons were used on them but there was another group of protesters who showed up armed https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/25/us/nfac-black-armed-group/index.html) to a protest for some reason s they weren t beaten up by the police like the guy in the articles i linked or so many many more people in who weren t rioting only protesting two very unjust murders the police didn t shoot these armed folks with bullets rubber bullets bean bags paint balls tear gas lasers or anything else their second amendment rights ensured their first amendment rights that s a big big deal but it sounds stupid right it was stupidly dangerous and could and reportedly did go wrong in many different ways and it definitely should not have been necessary in it s downright horrifying that it was necessary but it was necessary and it did work in the same year and protests that saw the sitting potus send paramilitary cbp tactical team members in privately rented vehicles to portland oregon against the express wishes of the mayor to snatch us citizens off the streets having a group of armed protesters worked if you don t think that s important you haven t studied world history of the last century or so google the protests in taiwan that happened around that same time frame none of the protesters were armed it didn t go that well for them though they did it anyway there s more to it than protests of course the dgu and sometimes the ccw subreddits include links to plenty of news articles about people protecting themselves with guns not everybody is a young fit person some of us are elderly out of shape or both we can t necessarily protect ourselves if someone tries to hurt us or our loved ones that s where guns come in i spent enough years doing judo that i a ruined my own health somewhat and b know the cost of fighting someone physically you can end up with injuries that you carry with you for the rest of your life and maybe it s not you maybe it s your parents or grandparents let s say it worked though civilians can no longer own firearms and to heck with the victims in the dgu stories do you think guns will all be removed once the law goes into effect hardly australia tried it they are tiny in population compared to the us and they re still collecting guns each year from criminals they ve had some success but again they re tiny google says there are australians of today the us census bureau via google says we were at americans on 1jan23 and there more guns than people in the us guns will not simply vanish what will happen is that honest people will give up their guns and then be defenseless against anybody who either didn t give theirs up or stole one if all guns were illegal for civilians starting today there d still be illegal guns around in your lifetime probably your grandchildren s lifetimes plus i guess the next time the police start murdering black people in the streets there won t be any safe way to protest not that protesting has ever helped do you know what happened the last time black folks started arming themselves against police brutality the national rifle association as well as the republican party supported gun control it was in the mulford act and then governor of california future potus republican ronald regan signed it gun control is racist because if you have enough money you can still own mostly whatever you want google the national firearms act or nfa and if you re rich you don t need guns because you can pay other people with guns to protect you this automatically dis proportionally impacts minorities but maybe you re protesting against the number one cause of death by guns in the usa each year by which i mean the thing that causes over percent of all gun deaths in the usa year by year suicide https://gunviolencearchive.org. if that s what you re protesting more power to you but i personally think we need things like universal healthcare including mental healthcare i believe that would help prevent intentional gun violence more than most things and especially more than a gun ban would whatever reason you re protesting gun violence good for you and always remember the us constitution and all of its amendments are for every citizen not just one political party i vote democrat and i own guns
i m sure they ve walked out of us government in the past or they d know we have a second amendment that means the government can t take our guns
are there people out there who think the next troubled kid who wants to shoot up a school is going to change their mind because of a walk out maybe some policy changes starting at the school board could help protect kids meanwhile parents could keep a close eye on all the red flags of these troubled children maybe even get them help that would be a good approach
that ll end it for sure
yeah whatever as long as i get to skip class
let s take a minute to remember those brave children who gave their lives to defend your 2nd amendment rights
thank goodness the young people of the world are willing to fight for this planet a lot of us are trying but we sure can use the help
you did it you ended gun violence
pay attention these are future voters not sure how many more groups can be alienated before a whole political party becomes the equivalent of an old man yelling at the tree dropping leaves on the grass
maybe they should get to the root cause of most of the school shootings and end bullying in schools it s obvious that school boards and administrators are doing absolutely nothing about it and are fine with it
damn i thought they made gun violence illegal awhile ago
school lol ok plus absence
demand that schools become harder targets
that doesn t look genuine to me look at a protester from france then compare it to these smiling faces
now go block a gunrange entrance where gun owners will get the message i dont think you have to convince teachers that they dont want to die at work
cnt be shot if they aren t in class
the amount of people in here dismissing a protest because it s kids is pretty fucking alarming
guns are not the problem it s the idiots pulling trigger killing people and making responsible gun owners look bad
and what were their proposals
the there s nothing we can do crowd is going to be pissed good
great job you ll get a lot of people expecting you to come up with answers just because you don t want to be shot while going to school they believe there is nothing that can be done even though the truth is the us is the only first world developed country that has a gun problem great job standing up today
wished i lived in the us so i could have a gun
wait till they outlaw guns then the real violence begins when only criminals have guns
since i was in hs whenever students would walk out in protest there were always assholes saying the same thing about ditching to not be in class or this will surely solve everything sarcastically fuck those people keep protesting vote sway others to vote as well don t give up and be jaded like some of the assholes on this comment section keep fighting and never stop
good for you you re going to get a lot of negative comments don t let them get you down
you are all awesome and i support you
this is just an excuse to skip school
that s fuckin dumb
my senior year i organized protests and walkouts at my highschool and surrounding schools in after the march for our lives it truly breaks my heart to see that these things are still so necessary but it makes me proud that you kids are continuing to step up to plate keep it up
we did boys we ended gun violence i guess anyone thinking about committing gun violence changed his mine after seeing that people don t support gun violence he was just looking for social validation with that shooting
none of these kids give a fuck about gun violence as much as they do getting out of school for a couple of hours they probably all ended up at the local mcdonald s up the road standing in line for minutes just to get a couple cheeseburgers and then continue to stand in line asking for a cup so that they could get water since they don t have enough to get a soda as dorky as it sounds i really wish i can go back to being in high school again
i m not saying it s not admirable but it s likely going to have zero effect on the people likely to act violently with guns
thanks for doing this keep protesting you have to make them listen
and what possible other reason could highschool students have to walk out of class i mean students love class
hello i was able to respond to some of the comments last night but later i went to bed and did not expect it to blow up the way it did but i d figure id clear up some things a lot of people were talking about how happy we look and that might is probably my fault because i took more than just that photo and this is the only photo where everyone is smiling and in the others we looked a lot more serious several have talked about how we probably did it just to skip school and honestly i m sure a lot did but just as much walked out because they not only agreed with the cause but took it seriously so many are saying that this will do nothing and this probably will do nothing but this is a step towards doing something this my my first protest in support of something i believe in and this will be the only one for a while because my mom is far right and disagrees with me on a lot of topics and won t allow me to attend things like this so it may seem like nothing but for me and a lot of others at my school this was huge because we took risk doing this even thought the school was ok with it everybody posted online about and if my mom and a lot of others parents found it we could be severely punished for this so this is a huge first step for us in the future i will attend protests that are legit and are more likely to do something but for now this was the best we can do in the state of mississippi which is a part of the deep south and part of the bible belt some complain that this won t scare away any potential shooter and they are right however that was not our goal our goal was to show our local state and federal government that we want change right now and they need to do something instead of just sitting around while others die i hope this clears the air some if you have any more questions let me know

beautiful member of the woodpecker family i see them in my loblolly pine trees all year hammering away loud call too never held one though
aww make sure you put some stickers or window clings up birds don t see glass very well and if they re in flight path you might save the little ones from concussions
great gift for you
i wish i had the power to summon bird friends
hey that bird in your hand is worth two in the bush
it s a beautiful bird
i have a male female that come visit my bird feeders every day guess they d rather come for the steady meal that go beating their faces against the trees
that s so cool
that s a red headed woodpecker
these photos are evidence of a crime in the u s
why is he so chill
window dash
that bird looks like maryland s flag
window chalk works well to prevent bird strikes my windows are cold blooded bird killers without the chalk
what did you call me
definitely the correct birb
i was so close lol
good call thankfully this is the only time it s happened in years of living here
agreed it was very cool to have that moment and was made all the better by its quick recovery
truly amazing i m jealous
i couldn t agree more good call
yellow bellied sapsucker
this comment is evidence of an idiot in the u s
he didnt eat it
migratory bird act i don t think the capturing transport part could prevent you from taking it out of your own house and releasing it but yeah best not to ham fist a wild bird for a number of reasons
lol
if you look at the trees around you you ll probably see straight horizontal lines of holes where it s been looking for food for some reason this species peck holes that way when other birds tend to be more random
i have downy woodpeckers here so i put feeders outside my windows so they have something to fly to instead of trying to fly into the windows plus i get a free show when they come eat
you are so lucky to have had such a close encounter with this beautiful bird thank you for treating it gently and giving water i hope you get laid by the person of your dreams every day for the rest of your long life
grab em by the penal code nice
jesus how can you parade around a sign suggesting that people should be hanged the lack of morality is disgusting edit alright hanged i did know that i just forgot snuck is considered proper in place of sneaked nowadays when will the hanged hung revolution occur we have the technology
the party of law and order believes trump should be above said law and order also they already threatened the police department of ny way to back the blue guys
i ll never understand blacks for trump
i ve got too much shit on me
alvin bragg is a alvin bragg
the winner for me is grab them by the penal code
those republicans are gone be real upset if they learn how to read
grab em by the penal code is pretty inspired
yeah bothsides are the same that dude in the mask is exactly as bad as the lynching sign guy edit holly shit didn t think i needed this s
this country is so fucking stupid
a humorist did a pretty good article about how trump might be the antichrist i don t see any other way that people have been so blinded and mislead by this clown he doesn t share any of the values that republicans value yet so many still can see no wrong
one of these protests is going to eventually turn violent it kind of reminds me of v for vendetta a bit but weirder we are in a pretty bad place as a country
two genders here get your two genders here hey two genders get ya two genders the dude selling bigotry at yesterday s rally
karl havoc
blacks for trump isn t that like jews for hitler what is it about trump that made them turn into a group of uncle toms
lol blacks for trump we love bigots
the person in the first image looks like the worst booji boy cosplayer ever
how much do these people pay for custom flags like that so freaking many of them biden should have a company that makes them so they are funding bidens campaign
i m just glad the nypd decided to be useful and kept them separated
this could become another halloween like holiday i think people would get really into it
so very weird to me to see so many people so enthusiastically engaged in this bizarre cult have read about why some people are more susceptible to the propaganda and influence of cults but i still can t comprehend this craziness
on second thought let s not go to new york tis a silly place
blacks for trump is like jews for hitler
blacks for trump is weird because if he could he d either deport them strip their rights or just plain shoot em all he doesn t see minorities as people
it s amazing that politicians are more famous than any celebrity it s also amazing how many people don t have shit to do on a wednesday
looks like fun wish i could be there
don t these people have day jobs
deleted
americanism and its consequences are a disaster for mankind
lmao blacks for trump he d throw all of you into slave mines if he could legally
i m sorry but there is no majority vote in a trial we don t get to just lock someone up because we don t like them wait for the evidence and trust in due process
meanwhile the thugs are murdering carjacking assaulting stealing vandalizing etc but who cares no one
black for trump imagine hating yourself that much
democrats going to be real upset when trump doesn t spend one day in jail while maga nerds are going to be protesting for the longest time if clinton lying under oath and w started an illegal war get no jail time how is this any different
the face of american politics
i m just here to laugh at all the undiagnosed tds in this thread like all of the trump era scandals this could have been an actual thing but instead is only another spectacle why not try him for his war crimes or for being corrupted by israel any of the actual crimes that every president and high ranking politician in our lifetimes has been guilty of because that sets a precedent that can be used against the rest of the criminals atleast they know yall will eat another nothingburger and thank them for a feast
i can t wait till we carve trump on mount rushmore he s top of the best presidents we ever had and i m sad i didn t vote in for him hated him but i voted for him one of the most badass presidents we ve had
blacks for trump self hate wtf
i know this is just me but i can t imagine caring about anything enough to dress up and go out into public and waste my time showing other people what my opinions views are
the third photo and others like it will always baffle me poor dumb bastards
most of those blacks for trumps guys i m pretty sure are homeless people that someone gave cash too and told them to protest like that
i m seriously bored with the trump thing and before you ask nope not a hater or supporter i m completely indifferent to politics except for this statement they re all crooked all have their hands out and would steal candy from a baby given a chance
deleted
at this point i want trump to be president again there is so much talk about how great he is let him have more years and then we can see all the nothing he gets done then the world can move on
this right here screams horror and also
i thought that was michael meyers in the first pic
i love rick south park
the chin kills
a little bit of everything here our city is so diverse
willie nelson showed up for it too in the second pic
the sad part is people spent money to make those signs
looks like a fun day lol
too much fucking shit on me
i looked up the website on image oh boy is it an experience https://gods2.com)
gif giphy 3xknuy3vh8qbpmjzjk downsized
i feel like i would be sitting off to the side with a snack or two and a drink just waiting to see shit go down
clearly the spitting image of nelson mandela and jesus rolled into one
keep it peaceful people please please no violence violence here from to any side in any form could explode the country peaceful assembly yes free speech yes physical violence no let the legal system work as pissed off as people are on both sides both on scene there now and out in the rest of the nation it needs to stay peaceful down there keep sparks out of the tinderbox
like him or hate him it must be nice to have the ability to not work and or have the free time to go to this circus
not from the us but the blacks for trump crowd i find bizarre do these guys actually think trump has respect for them do they think they would be welcome at his house
blacks for trump paralyzes my brain
circus came to town
i wish the extra terrestrials would just show up and kill us all
it s a shame how one country can become so divided
left wing protesters prosecute the guy who broke the law right wing protesters let s lynch innocent people the juxtaposition with the blacks for trump group is astonishing i can t even imagine the cognitive dissonance required
everyone here is probably insufferable
tracks for bump
if trump did all he is accused of he could run as a democrat
lol the blacks for trump showed up because trump pointed out his one black friend that one time
back in orange
i dislike both sides
well its nice to see people on both sides of the spectrum coming together
so what does jason have to do with all this and which halloween movie is he referring to
you can t fix stupid
so surprised boone there was bumping ice cubes arrest the president missed opportunity there
seems inconsequential considering most presidents should already be imprisoned for war crimes
alvin bragg is a alvin bragg
gotta love a clever sign
removed
easily the best one
probably also claims that america is dying because of a lack of morality r_selfawarewolves
seeing a man dressed like a woman can confuse children so we should ban anyone in drag from being anywhere where there could ever be children present anyway i need to go now i have to tell my children that it s ok to threaten to violently murder people who have different political opinions and explain how a sexist racist criminal billionaire literally shitting into a gold toilet is actually a man of the people i m fine with people being conservative politically what i can t understand is how anyone could ever like anything about trump or what he represents especially if things like morality and decency are priorities in your life i just can t wrap my head around what their reality looks like through their eyes how can they look at the same society i look at and see demons everywhere except around the actual devil
same side as the blacks for trump
they also think the media is liberal when its pretty much all owned by rich white conservatives
yeah it should be hanged unless they re particularly interested in how their foes are hung
you can tell from the sentance structure that they re not all there
pretty standard for everyone right now unfortunately
hanged
i was wondering what you were talking about until i read the sign on the right in picture four
the party that ran a presidential campaign on lock her up now unironically arguing that it s an insane world we live in where losing an election can lead to legal repercussions
not just that the party against cancel culture wants to hang the opposition effectively cancelling them forever
there were jews for hitler back in in the day too https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/association_of_german_national_jews
all you need to know to understand it is right on their website i took a quick look at gods2 com and it is unhinged ramblings and youtube conspiracy shit legit looks like mental illness
if you look at all these guys they are wearing oversized t shirts over their normal cloths so they are either a embarrassed to wear this on the street after the rally or b were given these last minute to wear by someone also the blacks for trump are just black hebrew israelites a super racist and in your face cult not surprise they would attach themselves to trump
as a black person i ve had a lifelong look into the intricacies of the black community unfortunately religion homophobia transphobia and colorism internalized racism are long standing pillars to which many subscribe thankfully these mindsets are easing with each new generation but it s going to take a very long time for them to go away you d be surprised how many black folks especially older black folks hold deeply conservative hard right values and ideologies if these folks were white then there s a damn high chance they d vote red
black and hispanic support for trump increased from to
what s funny he s never had any of them at his dinner table at florida or new york but yet he s had a white supremacist however you should look up who started the blacks for trump group it s terrifying founder maurice symonette a k a michael the black man a former member of a violent cult who posts anti semitic screeds and racist conspiracy theories online
maga hat someone find out where kanye west was last night
there s a lot of conservatives of all colors i see it a lot in the south especially outside of the major metros and amongst religious minorities

forbidden chocolate
he s getting ready for the natural tiger building competition
seasons and were meh but reason was fire

joe rogan mode on look at the muscle on that thing you think you could take a tiger in a one v one guest ugghhhhh joe i don t think anyone can do anything agaisnt it even a heavyweight mma fighter would have trouble what about a gorilla maybe it can box it jamie pull out the video of that gorilla boxing guest da fuck

cruella s definitely going to spot that one
i thought they were scary before til i learn they have active camo nope
it is indeed chocolate mud lol
this looks like the worst photoshop job ever and i cannot make my brain see it any other way
chocolate dipped
when do you think the rendering will be done
exposed chocolate animal crackers are not cruelty free
bro havent unlocked the rest of the skin
he got litt the hell up

chocotiger
a pretty kitty dipped in chocolate syrup
chocolate dipped soft serve ice cream cone
the colors are clearly distinguished
how can the front paws have no mud
on his way to compete in a bodybuilding competition

if i saw myself in front of one of these i think i would just die of fright
shrooms just hit wtf
agreed i saw a hippo back end and tiger front next
lolol first glance thought it was a bad photoshop job
logan paul s nft project
nobody mentioned r confusingperspective
at first i thought it was like a google street view stitching error
like those dna splicing puzzles in those kids science museum
ps is prohibited in the animal kingdom
that was my first thought too i m pretty sure it s real but the line of demarcation is remarkably straight which my brain registered as fake until i took a closer look
the fact it looks like a bad photoshop is definitely a reason to doubt it that being said it s supposedly real there s pics of other angles in a comment below
it is a photoshop i seen it posted in another sub a while back had the same narrative as this but was eventually outed and detailed to the process
god damn texture popping
tiger shaped chocolate would be cool
what s weird al have to do with it
it laid down on its side in a puddle more or less it s not dipped so to speak if you look at its spine you can see why it looks the way it does
it isn t if you look close enough

coors hat bud beer someone is label fluid
are you trying to tell me that the rich son of a metro detroit auto dealership owner who bills himself as straight out the trailer is a phony
omg with a bud light in his hand omg omg omg
this was back at the height of his popularity now that no one cares about him he has to cater to his trailer park persona crowd
this is a whole new genre in itself pictures of people from life before they were told to be angry
one of those people wrote a song where they bragged about sleeping with underaged girls guess which one
yep many conservatives used to have no problem with drag rudy giuliani used to wear drag all the time here s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zhhgbyrznu&t=60s) a skit america s mayor did on snl in drag from here s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbku9oj8ltk) donald trump motor boating rudy giuliani in drag in
what hypocrisy from kid rock surely not
bob is just getting into politics just like every other auto dealerships owners kid don t come home bob you aren t wanted here
this needs to be posted to his ig so those ignorant hillbillies can see
so you re saying he s a fucking hypocrite trying to pander to right wingers in order to have any audience at all is anybody shocked
bud light in his mouth coors on his hat drag on the deck
back when he didn t mind a long neck in his mouth
people realized there s money to be made from suckers if you tell them you really believe in something they also believe in
i love the endless stream of this you that the gop and its fans create
kid rock s cool daddy cool lyrics now some people say my mind s blown i m coolin like a snow cone on my cell phone i m paid g can t call me just page me young ladies young ladies i like em underage see some say that s statutory but i say it s mandatory
that was kid rock today we have bob ritchie
i d be much more worried about children being around kid rock than being around some drag queen
kid rock s a groomer always has been
just so you know so it s set in stone kid rock don t come from where i come from yeah it s true he s a yank he ain t no son of hank and if you even thought so god damn you re fuckin dumb hank
typical maga idiot getting pissed about stuff just because tucker carlson tells him to
in his defense he had no idea republicans were going to manufacture great drag crisis years later
maga is a brain rot disease that makes everyone it touches a complete moron
lol he is like many others jumping on the bandwagon of grifting hateful uneducated losers that s what trump made all these people realize you can grift tens of millions out of these utter idiots by feeding them the outrage they so deeply crave
just trying to stay relevant in these times by feeding on the trumps supporters hate
why are we giving this poser attention he is and always has been the literal definition of a poser
and he s drinking a bud lite
that s a bigger black mark on the drag communities reputation than any of the horseshit conservatives are making up
conservatives always turn out to be hypocrites
i m triggered by the way he s sucking on the beer bottle
def leppard sucks
sucking that beer hard too
kid rock s lyrics to cool daddy cool on the osmosis jones soundtrack now some people say my mind s blown i m coolin like a snow cone on my cell phone i m paid g can t call me just page me young ladies young ladies i like em underage see some say that s statutory joe c but i say it s mandatory i believe this is called projecting
but that was before he was told that hating trans people and drag queens is the thing that will make him those sweet rube dollars
almost like he s just a total grifter who knows how to rile up his audience and has no consistent moral stances
everybody s talking politics and here i am astonished at the size of those hands
how soon they forget the internet remembers
lol in a coors hat too
kid rock is just a shitty ted nugent who is also shitty for another generation
am i understanding this correctly kid rock s whole vibe is some variance of blue collar southern hick but he s actually from a northern white collar family did i get that right
this photo contains quite a few things that repubs are against now lol budlight trans endorsement deal coors i dont think some of them know about the denver pride parade sponsorship yet drag queen oh kid rock how far you have fallen you sweet sweet summer child you https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kid-rock-bud-light-woke-trans-protest-dylan-mulvaney-1234709445/)
that s just dennis rodman
garbage human being
fucking hypocrite at its finest fuck kid rock and fuck maga too
can we stop giving this tool attention
drag queens are cool af
oh so he is a hypocrite
many drag queens are not trans
as a citizen of detroit i want to officially apologize for kid rock we are still trying to figure out how he broke out of his restraints it was certainly not our intent to loose him upon the world we are deeply sorry for this turn of events sincerely the people of detroit
kid rock was a hit wonder saw he d be able to grift from the trumpies and has been playing along to keep the money from drying up he s a dog and pony show
kid rock is a has been who has spent the past years doing nothing more than living on the minutes of fame he had years ago he s not considered a serious artist anymore and lord knows he hasn t had a good song in years he s just trying to generate buzz and get people to talk about him anyway he can pretty pathetic
did i miss something has kid rock come out against drag queens for no reason
i hate that instead of being a fun photo i knew automatically that seeing this image means kid rock has gone full tilt trans panic took a look and yep he s getting performatively violent over some brand supporting a trans person should ve expected it he s so like people i know back home in michigan formally pretty fun always a bit of a poser and now fully enveloped in the right wing hate machine what an embarrassment to the state
these people really don t seem to understand that being trans is part of that whole freedom thing they constantly talk about you know that whole freedom of expression if you don t like it what s that thing they always say
more projection to nobody s surprise
hypocrisy at its finest
he s just a empty mouthpiece for the fascists
kid rock is a groomer why would he name himself kid
before he caught the hate mind virus
kid rock drinks beer like he s kissing the tip of a dick
before he was a dick
and he s drinking a bud light kid rock is gay
looks like he s getting ready to suck on that longneck until it s dry
i mean he s really giving it to that bud light isn t he
simpler times
lol what s with conservatives trying to cancel bud light all of a sudden this cancel culture is getting out of control
to be fair i wouldn t want my kids to go to the kid rock story time hour
i landed somewhere in a hell s venn diagram with this guy about years ago i was friends with one of his exes i could tell he had been incredibly disrespectful to her so this guy was always a piece of shit he may be radicalized now or whatever but the old version of him sucked as a human being also
kid rock s career was tanking so he jumped on the conservative hate train to make that dirty money
a maga republican being a hypocrite get the fuck out of here
to quote his song that was in the movie osmosis jones young ladies young ladies i like em underage see some say it s statutory but i say it s mandatory
he s a gross human and is and has always been a fraud f him
he has become a really weird guy just a complete opportunist and grifter at this point he s always been one of course with his fake ass background but now he s gone full send on just taking people s money and looking for what little notoriety he can scrape from the bottom of the barrel from his dumbass bbq venture to his terrible politically motivated songs and now to boycotting a fucking beer he likely never even drinks if there s a face for early onset dementia this guy would have to be it
hey hey come on guys people are allowed to change and become terrible pieces of garbage
so a typical gaslighting maga freak
he has sucked more then beer bottles
just a casual crossdrinker
dude passes out in the gutter on both sides of the street
lmao this is where you can see it s just grifting old rock was washed up and then he played at trump s meeting and gain a massive boost and decided to all in maga trans woke ima shoot a beer chicken winged on fucking tiktok or whatever jfc
no it light bud beer
the early life section on his wikipedia page makes me laugh every time kid rock was born robert james ritchie in romeo michigan on january the son of susan and william ritchie who owned multiple car dealerships he was raised in his father s square foot m2 home on a acre hectare property where he regularly helped his family pick apples and care for their horses a real common man
i loved pam anderson s in her documentary saying bob like it was shit in her mouth and then the only nice thing she has to say was he was nice to her kids when you ve been with the creepiest creeps and you re still creeped out by bob that says something
at least he isn t faking being a piece of trash
gif giphy kyiyzidj7d68t7vccg
to be fair it was a trailer that carried his families prized horses
it gets better he came down hard on blm while having started his music career doing rap music and having a half black son i say this with every fiber in my being fuck kid rock
just goes to show that rich people can be rednecks too
with a coors hat wtf
he used to drink it all the time now he s coping hard https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kid-rock-bud-light-woke-trans-protest-dylan-mulvaney-1234709445/amp/
a shifting sea of beer and ideological loyalties
hope kid rock doesn t see this he might shoot himself
i didn t even notice that
bud and drag queens were still cool
this just in bigots outraged as they learn that drinking beer isn t exclusive to bigots
confirmed gay
this was back at the height of his popularity now that no one cares about him he has to cater to his trailer park persona crowd
friend in drag check bud light in hand check coors hat check this image is the embodiment of irony
i support trans people but i aint drinking bud light
i m just surprised how little it takes for beer drinkers to change their sexual orientation
rednecks are so mad that they re showing up for work sober
a little late to the party lucky charms have been turning people gay since p
bud light corporate meeting we can t seem to break out of the ex marine broke redneck demographic how do we fix this marketing dept hold my beer
wait is this the reason what s his face was so pissed he shoot a whole bunch of beers
last summer went golfing got paired with a random couple of guys being the nice guy i am offered to buy them a couple beers on the back one guy asked for bud light came with a rainbow can he was not impressed n i m like wtf drinking from a rainbow can doesn t make you gay drinking bud light makes you gay or turns the frogs gay or something like that
bud lite had rainbow cans a few years ago i worked security at a liquor store and a lady came in to return a case of bud lite because her husband refused to drink out of a can with a rainbow on it imagine being so full of hate that you make your wife return a case of beer because of what s on the can
beer
they love everyone s identity so much they just partnered with fifa to sponsor the world cup in a country where your identity will get you beheaded the same country where it is literally illegal to sell their products wow so inclusive these companies don t give a shit about you or your social issues they care about money they changed their cans and they got more free advertising from outraged people and from dipshits like you who post this stuff than they would on a superbowl ad
i mean the can is ugly and i hate bud light but if they slapped that shit on a beer i did like it wouldn t stop me from drinking it
if it makes you feel any better bud light doesn t care they just do what they think will make more money do you think they do this in the middle east
you know they ve had rainbow bud light since but sure keep going https://www.anheuser-busch.com/newsroom/bud-light-celebrates-world-pride-with-rainbow-inspired-bottles-b](https://www.anheuser-busch.com/newsroom/bud-light-celebrates-world-pride-with-rainbow-inspired-bottles-b)
oddly enough i used to drink with some of the ab marketing folks at a little place called the fox hound when i lived in stl during the dark days of the clinton administration and i can say with confidence unless something major has changed which it probably has with the sale of the brewery that this was a calculated move and they expect to make more sales with this than without it sharp folks to be sure
if you drink a beer that sells million barrels a year and think your lifestyle is the brand s only target demographic you deserve to be mocked
people are so fragile
i saw a rainbow in the sky today is everyone gay that saw it
imagine being such a sensitive snowflake that rainbows on a beer can triggers you to tears
i m surprised people even drink bud light it s awful
tolerance is an odd enemy to have
is this why kid rock shot mostly missed three cases of bud light
just another way to let people know your true feelings if beer makes you mad
i like how a lot of these people would get upset at blm and say all lives matter now it s celebrate all gender identities and they re so upset
i m more mad that people consider this beer
bud be nice to humans right wingers the fuck i will then they whine that no one is civil to them lol
ohhh so this explains some of the insanity i ve seen today lol was wondering what their beef with bud was so fragile
have you seen the number of videos of grown ass men throwing out whole cases of beer because of this like how immature can you be
ah marketing bless those dumb enough to actually buy into it they d just as soon put a nazi logo on there if it was a majority demographic
you don t like bud light because what it is on the outside i don t like bud light because of what it is on the inside we are not the same
i personally do not mind what people are into or identify themselves as people getting straight up mad at things like these up to the point where they shoot the beer cans for example or return the product out of anger is really petty however what does irritate me more each time is how this specifically has to be addressed all the time when it comes to companies promotions and or entertainment movies tv shows etc also i really doubt these companies do it for the sake of sympathy and more so because it allows them to generate more money
yeah the fuck your feelings crowd can t control their emotions kinda funny
i can t imagine being so mentally unhealthy that you get mad over a beer and just can t let it go
removed
y all are literally upvoting a corporate ad
went to a joint in the rural midwest for lunch today and judging from the one and only topic of conversation in there it s great to see their whole culture fucking imploding from a beer promotion
i do think it is cool that they are doing this marketing now instead of june it comes off as more genuine
so this is what got kid rock in a tizzy he s such a snowflake
we ve had bud light pride in canada for years ontario anyways never heard anyone complain here and i live in a small farming town the guys here have no problem swiggin a rainbow brew
if you re mad at a case of beers you might just secretly hate the queers
how fragile do you have to be to get upset about something like this
just proves it was never about protecting kids its about being gay
im buying a bud light because i want to taste a bigots tears
it s ok you don t have to say certain people you can call them what they are sensative snowflakes throwing a fit
i had to look up the kid rock video on youtube to see what he was crying about god damn the comments so many people upset by a can they should all identify as princesses the way they re carrying on
people you snowflakes are triggered by everything and you cancel culture is shit same people get triggered by rainbows and want to cancel everything they dislike
its funny that the people that call us snowflakes are the real snowflakes here when they freak out about a rainbow on a beer can
i m surprised how people are triggered by this and not about the quality of the beer
i don t know why this clearly gold white can would upset anyone
did anyone see the kid rock video i loved it not because of the message he was trying to convey but the message i saw wanna be gangster fake ass white trash failed rapper turned country music aspiring actress got all kinds of triggered who is the real snowflakes again i lost track
still tastes like piss
i d love to make a beer and advertise everyone can eat shit on it and watch it fly off the shelves
it s funny having worked at a bar in a gayborhood i can tell you all alcohol companies have pride merch
if you ve got a thirst and you re gay drink schmitts gay
kid cock is crying into his bush lite over this
nothing they put on that can will make it good
i love how the ones that will lose their shit over this the hardest are the ones calling other people snowflakes
i like to imagine a bunch of red necks cursing and shaking their fists at the sky every time there is a rainbow
if i ve been following this correctly all these years there are afraid they may become gay what losers
the dude who replaced with coors should know that they also support the lgbt community
they re so over emotional about everything
if this beer is triggering your manhood maybe you re not as manly as you thought lol
go woke go profitable these guys made a fuck ton off of this the market demands stuff like this it responds to it you guys hate capitalism now
imagine thinking the worst thing about a can of bud light is the design on its exterior and not the dreadful content within sincerely an eu representative of good taste in beer
it s about as funny sad as a few years ago when they burned their nike gear for a few days because nike was woke i didn t know about the cans until i saw some rich bro dumping the bud lights out of his garage fridges on youtube
the best part is the people who are opposed are presenting that as part of their identity and would be thrilled for another special edition murca eagle and flag can to come out with the same exact piwaer in it fucking lunatic to give that much of a shit and exactly why the marketing company chose to not pander to the same hateful demographic they always do they are getting a ridiculous amount of press over it a win is a win
pretty sad state of affairs when people get mad at other people for existing
conservative frailty really is on another level who would have thought hating minority groups would make you such a massive bitch
oh grow up it s a colourful beer can ffs
how do you do fellow kids
i m torn because i want to buy some bud light now to support this but it also just tastes so bad
it s utterly insane how vitrolic the reaction has been they get pressed about a lot of dumb shit but you touch their shitty belgian owned pisswater shit that isn t even considered beer but instead adjunct lager they use a ton of rice to supplement the mash that they consider a murican institution and you might as well have banned the bible
we re mad because people call bud light beer right
how dare they put this in a product for children
imagine being mad over bud light america s shittiest beer
how unfortunate the packaging does nothing to improve the taste but i love watching how angry smacking a rainbow on a corporate label gets them they make whole videos throwing out product they already paid for totally oblivious to how stupid they are for it
you can still drink it if you call no homo before you pop the top
rainbows on bud cans makes the rednecks feel confused while they j o to trans porn
maybe they should do this with all alcohol domestic violence cases would plummet
i just wish they d keep it to themselves you know i hate having my face rubbed in it all the time i ve got nothing against people who drink light beer i just wish they d do it in private
i had at least customers at my store the other day bitch about boycotting budweiser over this lol it s insane how mad some people get over shit it s like they never knew budweiser has sponsored pride events for years before this the people getting angry over this are some really really dumb assholes
hell that beer would piss off people if you put it in a gold chalice
i hate this on a marketing level this company doesn t give a shit about lgbt people they just finished sponsoring the qatar world cup fuck qatar fuck bud fuck the people getting worked up over a rainbow and fuck the people dumb enough to be fooled by a phoney rainbow
a local brewery in my city in canada makes queer beer a light and fruity lager for pride month every summer it s a delicious summer lager
imagine in years from now people will stumble upon stories like this and think it wasn t real some people got so mad because a beer had a rainbow on it embarrassing
deleted
nothing about this can is interesting why would we even promote an alcohol brand for free on reddit r pics is r politics all the time
it is really stupid though
that s a weird looking dasani bottle
it s fine by me all these people are showing the world how much of a hateful bigot they are
i m sorry but i can t agree with the can glass bottles are by far the superior beer drinking container
yep bud light is shit but not for this reason lol
i am trans still not drinking bud light though
had a friend everyone called beer queer when we would party because he got gay as fuck after just a few beers turns out he was gay all the time he just got gayer
beer normally makes me change my physical orientation from straight up to on my back
thought it was common knowledge that all girls are bi after three beers j k
it s true i drank bud light in college and now i m gay
guess what guys guns are now gay too
not gonna lie and say a few drinks won t make me question some things about myself not even a lot like beers over the course of a few hours

i used to live in ocean grove lol used to go on boardwalk every day in summer ofc there was more of a beach erosion is bad now but seeing that brought back cool memories lol idk if still there but there used to be a salt water taffy place right outside of building
the taffy place was in that building right outside on ap side when we spread my dads ashes in the ocean his last request the beach was at least where used to be we left the shore in i know they brought sand to replace but a lot of storms ty tho for making me remember good times there
beach seemed pretty wide in both ap and og they do regularly replenish it used to live around there too was just visiting so many changes in ap the building on the og side was destroyed during sandy that might have been the place with the saltwater taffy there is sweet shop on the ap side not far past the building too
i know some old businesses came back to the area in new storefronts but ap doesn t have a dedicated salt water taffy place anymore from what i could tell still a great town given how it was pretty run down until the early 2000s
yea my sis goes back sometimes but shes in philly im in la so lol glad ap is getting redone i used to go to the library all the time read the books in the park across the street my mom used to work at the freedmans bakery on cookman ave i worked at the one in og good times

this is a very pointy photograph
designed by slartibartfast
one day i will go to norway
i mean it s no kenya
the water is that funny color due to a lack of heavy industry
i went on vacation to norway with my family and my uncle described it as yellowstone the country it s absolutely gorgeous and the people are great too if i ever wanted to emigrate i d go there
noway
lovely
no way
gonna go camping there this summer
always wanted to go there maybe someday
is that a gated community with an entrance fee
wow
but there s no lions
looks kinda cold
does the sea level never rise during high tides or storms for them to build homes so close to the edge
looks perfect if you ask me
wow those mountains are jagged also love the way the water is so still and reflective
if i were a god i would live there
that is one pointy mountain
norway can have nice things
shrugs
photographers really know how to make norway look pristine can people attest to this
lofoten
yes and the stretching makes the boats look ridiculous different vantage point but you can see lofoten is pretty even when viewed undistorted https://c8.alamy.com/comp/e64998/harbour-in-winter-at-hamnoy-lofoten-islands-norway-e64998.jpg)
spent two weeks there last summer would recommend
sorry forgot the r
i don t think you notice tides that much when the sea immediately gets deep there s no shallow parts there like on beaches same goes for storms i guess the water gets pushed up on land because it s shallow and there s nowhere else for it to go

pangolin accused of crossing the boundary between animal and human infection of covid
the site of the world s first atomic bomb explosion is open to the public twice a year usually on the first saturdays of april and october the site is located about hours drive south of albuquerque new mexico deep in the white sands missile range i went on saturday as part of interest in visiting and photographing places significant to the cold war and atomic history in general this monument is made of lava rock and sits a few feet above the foundations of one of the four legs of the tower that housed the bomb a few feet out of frame to the left is the exposed cement and rebar of one of the other legs x200b i knew there was still trinitite at the site i thought that it would be difficult to spot the green glassy substance and that i would walk around the site for hours staring at the ground straining to see a single piece but it was literally everywhere essentially when the bomb went off it lifted tons of soil into the air and the intense heat melted sand and rock into this substance which then rained down and kind of splattered all over the blast site i had read many times that the bomb turned the desert into glass and i used to have trouble picturing what that looked like imagining a flat surface like a frozen pond the reality was a lot more like chunks of viscous molten metal or lava it is is still radioactive and is easily measured as such while the radiation is detectable it isn t very much especially after years it is safe to handle and measures about as radioactive a standard home smoke detector x200b there is an outer fence and an inner fence connected by a long dirt path visitors can be on the path and inside the inner fence but most of the area around the blast radius of where trinitite was buried bulldozers pushed most of it into trenches and berms when the blast area was cleared there is a small building at ground zero that supposedly contains either an undisturbed area of trinitite or more probably large bins of the material stored the tower was tall and looked like this once assembled the gadget was hoisted up into the small shed at the top of the tower of course the tower was completely vaporized when the bomb went off several thousand people attend the open houses anyone can come i don t think i even had by id checked as i entered white sands missile range there isn t a lot to see all of the interesting stuff was either vaporized by the blast or was demolished in the 50s it probably never occurred to the army that this place would eventually be somewhat of a tourist attraction let alone a part of the national park system people wander the site looking for trinitite which guards tell them to put back there are tents with speakers and experts physicists and radiological technicians from white sands to answer questions and tell history there are even tables of large collected sample of trinitite for visitors to hold look at up close and measure with geigercounters the focal point is the obelisk and there was a consistent crowd around it the entire day people take turns taking photos of the obelisk or with it there are selfies there are people saying cheese the crowd is a lot of students studying nuclear physics retirees just doing one more thing in new mexico bikers out for a spring cruise boomers nerds and a handful of kids it was when i noticed a japanese tv crew filming people standing and smiling next to the obelisk that i decided that s enough merica for today on the back of the obelisk i noticed two or three peace cranes this was a memory i had long forgotten that suddenly thrust itself back to my attention i can remember being in elementary school in the early 90s and my class reading the story of sadako sasaki a child who died from long term effects of atomic bombing in hiroshima while in the hospital sasaki set a goal of folding paper cranes through this paper cranes for peace or as a protest against the use of nuclear weapons became a thing this memory resurfacing hit me way harder than i was ready for my experience visiting the site of the world s first nuclear weapon test has stirred many complex thoughts i suppose the least of which is there really isn t anywhere that americans think would not be a great place to bring their dog x200b like i said lot of complex feelings about the events i thought it was important for me to visit this site and try to grasp the scale or simply to stand on that spot where so much history happened and where so much was set into motion if you want to go into some real depth about trinity and what it led to i strongly recommend listening to watching this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcrtgtpc-go) that gives a pretty precise timeline and a lot of real quotes
when was the open weekend how hard was it to get in
very interesting and thought provoking post thank you
i worked next to nukes today last week i worked next to the vault where they examined radioactive cadavers in the 50s my wedding reception was at the museum of nuclear science i don t think that i ve shed a tear over nukes until i saw that crane thank you that was beautiful
the false sun detonated over trinity and man traded wonder for reason
very active the measures they are so very like a thing in a language very well done active yes the thing you speak about it is there
people brought dogs
fantastic summary if i m ever down that way when i retire i may check it out to your point about complex feelings my great uncle jack was with the british army and was captured by the japanese during wwii in singapore he spent the rest of the war as a pow and i remember relatives saying all his good friends died from being beaten and starved to death i never met him but i distinctly remember these stories my father used to tell including that all he had to his name when he was rescued released was a loincloth he kept that loincloth and would take it with him and wear it once a year at an annual reunion with his fellow former pow s in england not surprisingly he and his surviving mates all died relatively young in any regard his brother my grandfather also fought against the japanese in burma when i was young maybe i distinctly remember him telling me that the bloke who invented the atomic bomb should have been shot even as a kid i remember thinking that was profound but it wasn t till years later that i realized how profound and conflicting that statement was here s a guy who s only brother nearly died from japanese mistreatment and had himself spent nearly years from home in india burma fighting against them saying that i loved that man and served years myself in the military somalia bosnia x afghanistan and still don t get it if anything while dropping those bombs literally saved members of my own family s lives and probably millions of others it destroyed so much more and we still live with that same threat vis a vis ukraine russia north korea etc
they are held on the first saturdays of april and october no id was required no reservations the site opens at 9am and closed at 3pm about a thousand people go and a big line forms at the army base gate but it doesn t take long there were at least two sanctioned groups that were selling food grilling up burgers and hot dogs in the parking areas the army brings out a ton of portapotties and there were tents with wsmr employees showcasing historical photos and large cases of trinitite there was a lot of trinitite made available for people to handle look at up close and even measure with geigercounters
man don t google ebb cade
yes what s so surprising about that
i want to go some day i got to go to white sands proving ground when i was a teenager
yeahhhhhh too late oppenheimer s family actually has a place near mine in the santa fe national forest

some years ago there was a near tame one in our neighborhood eventually got him or her to eat out of my hand at first taking a whole peanut in the shell then unbroken halves out of the shell eventually eating broken pieces the bird would perch on my hand or one of my fingers then calmly eat their fill then fly away the bird would even come into my shop and perch on my workbench waiting for me to feed them i had a small ziplock type bag that i kept filled with chopped peanuts always in my pocket so i was ready when the bird showed up we called it hoppy one of the feet was messed up so it stood on one leg most of the time and would hop from spot to spot
stupid little stick legs
awwk so true
what a great story my father in law leaves pecans for one and it will wait for them if he s late

i had a lady do that to me a few months back and i had to get my son in his car seat the lady was just getting out and i said something i truly don t think she was being malicious some drivers are just shockingly unaware

right rear tire of the honda is completely in my spot and i intentionally parked as close to the divider as i could i get that this fj isn t super nice but man i like it lol
i thought about hooking up the winch and dragging it straight but i figured that might be excessive
i guess the crews carpark at base was closed so they were allowed to park on deck
from a previous posting of this image these are the personal vehicles of the crew when the carrier changed home ports
cool pic i knew they were big but damn
challenge date the photo by the model years in the picture
and not one of them went more than 50ft off the end
doubtful a lot of the cars look like they have wheel locks on them s
ship is changing port and those are the crews personal vehicles
2015ish
i d say a few years earlier there isn t an f150 that s newer than on deck and only one of them is in that generation same with the mustang the only one i see is from the generation

uranus is a gas giant
i would have thought there would be more hair
it s incredibly beautiful
that may be uranus but it s definitely not mine if there was a large object in the middle of mine that would be a problem
that s not my butthole
goatze vibes
who told you i wanted to look at uranus
yes i always wanted clear pictures of the brown rings around uranus
my anus looks nothing like that
i do not consent to nasa uploading my personal pictures like this
that s one hell of a hemorrhoid in that ring
somehow we always knew
is this from inside
it s brighter than i thought
that s fricken sick
until webb telescope was used we didn t know uranus had rings
are there hemorrhoids ahem i mean are there astroids in uranus

honestly for some reason i had never even considered that these places had their own license plates
this might be the most american statement i ve ever read
how many people did you kick sand on
what did you take this with
like cats
the actual toys in the box are too prescriptive in that they dictate what can and cannot be done that is not nearly as engaging what your kids are doing is actually playing buy more cardboard boxes paint clay and tools knives paint brushes scotch tape and less toys
haha i got my year old a cardboard cutter and pegs that join them together he loves it and has come up with some neat things to make
sweet rocket ship
this was me as a kid things just seem to be universal got a present that came in a big box play with the box and ignore the contents
someone should tell them that it s not bulletproof
ok but where did you get the huge toy thing at lol
wow silent hill vibes all over
hello darkness my old friend
