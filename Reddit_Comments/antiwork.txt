hey everyone just gonna sticky a comment real quick about why tipping is a thing in the us and it can t shouldn t be boiled down to simply it s cultural it s also based on labor laws that were established because of the culture here s a good resource i suggest anyone interested learning about tipping and wages in the us look at before talking about it it s the department of labor gov site so everything is on the books laws and instantly updated https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped now to explain a few things as simply as i can this is the bare bare minimum hourly wage a tipped employee and not all people who hand you food are on the books as tipped employees can earn plain and simple if someone makes in tips in hour the employer is legally responsible to pay them in any us territory by law this is the maximum tip credit against minimum wage or more simply if a worker anywhere in the us makes in tips during an hour of pay the employer must pay up to to meet the federal minimum wage so in any state where the tipped minimum wage is less than you will be paying for a worker s hourly wage up to instead of their employer this is the pay rate for every single worker in the us as of july plain and simple a worker can never ever ever be paid less than hour if they are on the books employee of a business but like i pointed out above tipped employees can oh and trust me they do get paid by employers and the rest if either made up for by people tipping or the owner employer nbsp so remember the next time you go out to eat the worker could be getting by law anywhere from hour to hour probably the former if the state is republican and sometimes you pay of that and in case it s not obvious was barely a living wage years ago when it was made law it definitely isn t anywhere now nbsp also quick ps nbsp if a worker is not specifically labeled as an employee of a company a company lets use door dash as an example can get away with not paying the or if they label the worker as a non employee and they absolute did do and fight laws that say they must so the company can charge sometimes for delivering food and pay a worker quite literally whatever they think is fair something to keep in mind
genuine question if servers were given the choice between a hr wage or keeping the current tipping system which would they choose how about at hr etc i ve heard former servers say that they like the tipping convention because they make more than they would relying on a standard wage i m trying to figure out if that s true and if so where the boundary is between acceptable and unacceptable pay
please remember that service staff being underpaid is due to bosses refusing to pay a living wage and that service staff are not at fault for participating in a tip based economy this is such a weird statement to make imo and especially weird to imply mods will ban people who disagree lmao every single friend i have that works in the service industry talks about how much they love tipping and never seem to want to admit the fact that they get minimum wage if their tips do not meet minimum wage it s incredibly disingenuous how often people post their checks and say tip your waiter and completely gloss over the fact that they made in tips during that pay period tipping culture is so pervasive because business benefit from it and servers benefit from it so they have no incentive to push back against it pretending servers are unwilling participants in the system is asinine it s simply not the case if servers didn t like tipping they could certainly shift the indstury but tipping in often a more beneficial system for them when i was a server i consistently had enough money and even during slow periods i had plenty of money because i made tons during the up periods i m not saying don t tip but let s not pretend servers are just innocent victims to the system
at what point is tipping about rewarding a service position that is directly benefiting you versus tipping to supplement low wages if we are tipping to ensure survival for one large group of people most waiters waitresses shouldn t we be asking every employee everywhere that we interact with how much income they make so we can make sure they can survive too and supplement their income i don t think it s fair to assume how much people make based on the job they do so isn t it up to the customers to ensure that the people they interact with at these business for any reason are making a fair wage how can we sleep at night knowing that we generalize and tip people who bring us food but not those who say collect our garbage it would be a travesty to assume that the garbage collector is able to feed their kids so if we re not supplementing their wage we re no better than those that don t tip at restaurants if you don t ask to see a paystub or w2 for any person who helps you in your role as a customer and choose to tip based on that number you see you are a greedy pig point blank
i think that the tipping everywhere has eroded the understanding of the need to tip servers delivery etc the turning around of the screen with tip amounts is leaving people with a bad taste this may cause people to not tip when it s needed
restaurants are a toxic industry and i m not entirely sure we should be supporting them at all making food at home is cheaper and if you have the time to do so is an all around better alternative to eating at a restaurant
work on getting rid of tip culture if you believe that s what s right but keep fucking tipping until it s gone
i m a delivery driver if we literally got rid of tips i would not accept any less than an hour and my current amount of ot i get i currently make a week after taxes going to non tipped would literally erase this for many employees who put in the work tip culture is out of control but don t punish service workers because of it
uber eats tipping before the service is even done wtf i always wonder if the driver can see the tip beforehand
i read tipping megathtead and immediately thought of cows
tipping is basically an entrenched practice of supplementing employer payroll
literally don t care you choose to work in an exploitive industry and have not once organized to fight for change then i will exercise every iota of power the tipping system gives me just remember my business is more important then your experience so retaliate at your peril
the service staff is moderately at fault for tipping economy often when suggestions of moving to think economy have happened wait stuff fights to get it because they know they would make more with tips
all tipping needs to die that should all be on the employer
maybe it is time to get rid of the percentage tips and just give a dollar amount you feel comfortable giving i have a family of so we regularly have higher bills at medium end restaurants there have been many times lately that my tip is paying them by far more per hour than i make i have a hard time getting my head around that
don t like tipping forced payment employer gets off free and the customer is blamed it s crazy game of russian roulette where the customer decides if the server eats a decent meal or not adam runis everything tipping
if you call my name out for me to get my coffee you don t deserve a tip if you bring my coffee to me in a dish that needs to be washed by somebody and not thrown away you will be tipped asking for a tip before i get service you don t get tipped
first pay servers more then stop tipping otherwise millions of people will starve lose apts lose transport
the i want to go to restaurants bars but not tip the staff as a way to teach society a lesson folks here are just the updated i want to go to restaurants bars but leave a fake with a bible verse on it as a way to lead people to christ people who have convinced themselves of a different possibly even more sociopathic fiction
there are a huge amount of service professions why are so few of them getting tip
i got a question say i got to some fancy restaurant with my partner we spend on food and on wine are we actually expected to tip on that
thank you
i used to deliver pizza we kept notes on who tipped and who didn t one house was notorious for attempting to short change us we kept all of them in the notes for the address if you were a no tipper your pizza would wait until i could deliver houses including yours because it s not worth the gas money that said we got dollar per house plus bucks an hour pizza cost about bucks each i d typically get bucks tips per house on average it was a good job overall i once got a dollar tip if i made an hour plus gas money id be equally as happy
there is one thing i dont understand on america tipping now i do understand that they are paid very low wages and depends on tips that far i get it but why is tipping lets say servers have tables you are sitting at one and order food with drink stay there for mins or so why are you expected to pay why not just go like ok i was here mins the wage is for example so ill tip servers gets half a hour worth of wage and doestn matter whatever i spend or during my food why is it at the same time if you just take a coffee how much is coffee now for say and sit there reading newpapers for a bit are you expected to just tip and be on your way once you are done why tips over say flat if the argument is so they make living wages wouldnt flat tipping be better as they would have living waves assuming there is enough people to fill tables and they could still make more with few tbales
any and all arguments surrounding tipping culture are meant for exactly this to pit workers against workers and halt the conversation about wages and workers rights when in reality all of us get fucked over while the same people stay rich
you should have just pinned the other thread that blew up instead of just deleting it
tipping is great allows me to circumvent the business and directly help the person helping me for instance i tipped a valet dollars and as a result he didn t charge me the dollar a night rate for valet parking i was able to help that nice young man and he was able to help me
the fact that the cnn headline right now as i m typing this is are you tipping too much just shows the disdain and disrespect this country has for people in the service industry that have to be on their feet all day and be nice to every asshole that they encounter or risk being fired written up we cannot control that the states don t want to raise our minimum wage not tipping us is only hurting us
the argument that don t punish the server for what the restaurant does doesn t work because i as a customer pay them more than the restaurant does per hour so i m going to make some management decisions if you think that power doesn t belong to me then pay them yourself with that said i always tip well just showing that the argument is stupid
us servers found a job that we re good at that actually allows us to make a living wage if you re arguing against tipping despite knowing that without it we would make close to minimum wage poverty wage you re not pro worker if you want to advocate for the worker then advocate for increasing wages while keeping tipping or for increasing the price of everything in the restaurant by and giving it directly to the server
if tipping is so bad let s all stop tipping until restaurants lose all their servers and have to hire using regular wages if tipping is so good let s all start tipping at all the other customer facing jobs like fast food cashiers or retail workers etc

oh thank fuck i was so tired of seeing these low effort anti tipping posts i swear it s a fed operation to disrupt the leftists roots of r antiwork
all tips must be shared with the owner the managers the cooks wait staff and hosts why it s what this thread wants equalization for all
remember there is only one right way to think and if you deviate from it moderators will take action enjoy your day
i hope that the people on here that are so anti tipping are also joining local organizations that support ripped workers roc is one unite here just to name a few because babes lmao you not tipping is fucking up one persons day if you really want to make shit better join an organization and do the work y all are wild
another issue i have with tipping though is wide disparities have been shown on tips by race and sex if more money is collected from your regular salary there would be less unfair disparities where for example a young white woman might get more tips than a middle aged black man who provides the same level or service
if you cannot afford to tip you need to eat at home

wow sounds like a lot of people in here have never been servers isn t the whole point of this reddit to support workers servers and hospitality industry folks have a whole lot of issues same as other workers why are you mad at another worker trying to survive when you could be mad at the ceos of chain restaurants lmao this is so wild to me if you don t tip you re an asshole take your idealogical shit else where you re not making a shift to a worker led culture by not paying people wtf lmao
i worked in food and beverage for 10yrs my family owned a restaurant for 20yrs i washed dishes i wrote payroll checks i ordered food hired and fired people the people who got tipped made more money than everyone else including managers often managers were the de facto bartenders and they made a lot more than hourly wage earners and none of them declared their true income
what do people think about when the screen asks for a tip at a fast food place when you are paying and before you even eat the food i think it is very cringe i don t even know if the cheesborger is good yet and you are asking for tip on the screen but alas i am not based enough and tip anyways
i tip
tipping flight attendants needs to become the norm when all is said and done we are making minimum wage or below please tip your fas
american living in uk went to pizza express on friday night bill was tipped we were only people but we were a little fiddly when ordering and also asked to order additional items for take home when it was time to go so gave some extra waitress looked genuinely emotional and said she really appreciated it is it that bad here too
i worked as a dancer at a club where we were the only employees of that type in the city everyone else was independent contractors also have worked as a waitress and a few other tip commission jobs have always heard people say they would prefer to be tipped over having an hourly wage and honestly it seems like it s because that s the only way to make more money for example i live in a small foothills town with nothing but retail or the medical industry for old peoples homes so for a lot of the uneducated and generationally poor people the possibility of making more money per shift even if it s not a guarantee it s worth the risk to them the tipping culture seems to prey on poor uneducated or young people who are often stuck in those positions it s honestly just sad i tip anywhere the employees wages are effected by those tips but this expansion of tipping once again just seems to target individuals instead of business owners responsibility to pay their employees a fair living wage

fuck everybody that doesn t tip properly it s been years since i has to rely on tips to pay my bills but ever since i always tip at least if you can t afford a good tip stay the fuck at home it s funny how easy it is to spot the fucking idiot swine who ve never worked a single shift in the service industry
the worst i ve ever tipped as an adult is she brought me the wrong thing so i drew a frowny face on the bill
my job explicitly states that i am not allowed to take cash tips under any circumstances what the actual hell it fucking sucks to see a customer about to hand me a crisp bill and my manager comes over to say oh sorry we can t take tips some customers have gotten clever though and just drop the tip on the counter and walk away it s so nice of them and it genuinely makes my day when that happens
definitely right i can suggest to each one of you that can you be more polite to your client
if tips get out of hand just stop eating out no business no money to make
in my area servers must make the minimum wage per hour but we still tip
question do instacart deliverers get to keep the tip
i was asked to tip for an automatic car wash wtaf
and all the comments below are why some of us outside the us are scratching our heads saying you make it so complicated when i used to travel for business the biggest headache was figuring out how much to tip and where to whom here in the uk there s always been an expectation to tip for reasonable service for and directly to food service workers hair dressers hotel staff porter car valet and in recent years food delivery drivers so if i queue in a line to buy something i wouldn t expect to tip usually if someone brings me something does something for me bring food shampoo my hair i expect to tip some areas have a habit of tipping bar staff too but it s not across the board and it could be more or less than if it s exceptionally crap or brilliant service i m not commenting that s all good or not just saying it s clear and fairly easy to calculate even when under the influence of alcohol btw a minimum wage here for on the books staff ie known to the inland revenue as a potentially tax paying individual is due to go up this week to wage band current rate from april age or over national living wage age to age to under apprentice edit not
from australia here i ll be visiting the usa hawaii later this year for the first time i d appreciate some information about tipping amounts percentages for the following i want to make sure people are properly compensated for their work the airport baggage attendant per bag rate the bellhop per bag rate taxi drivers restaurants looks like it s min based on this subreddit hotel staff cleaners staff that bring room service etc any and all advice is appreciated
overwhelming majority of people tip if you don t we just make fun of you for being poor and move onto the next one i made my rent in one shift last night we re doing just fine
worked as a server for years here s my take keep in mind in california i would clear a night in about hrs of work and that was at olive garden where i check on you about times throughout your meal i never expected as standard tip about was okay bc i am just taking orders and giving out food there s clearly a certain demographic that takes up the industry many will bitch abt not receiving bucks on a but literally will come to my table maybe twice like i said there s a reason your serving and not working fast food it s because this job allows you to make so much with so little effort i d make 8k after tips and check working on avg days a week and maybe picking up a double here and there i was well overpaid for what i did lol compared to what i actually worked
removed
i am a server i make an hour and am expected to live off all my tips my paychecks are all taxes lmao it s definitely not worth it but this is unfortunately the only job that would hire me after being unemployed for a few months but i gotta do what i gotta do
how do folks feel about tipping in california mandatory minimum wage no tip credit
unless you work at a dead restaurant waitresses typically destroy the minimum wage rates when tips are included when i was doing dishes as a wage slave it d be pretty normal for the morning lunch girls pull in on one weekend day seems like only the shitty waitresses want to have a set wage
just out of curiosity just say the minimum wage was raised many people have expressed that they would leave the industry as they would earn less do you think that in industries where tipping is the norm that you deserve more than others do on the same wage this is coming from someone in a country where tipping is not the norm although it is slowly trying to be implemented
business pays staff fairly business loses money on staff pay said business makes it back by increasing menu prices staff are not tipped business pays staff instead customers do not pay a tip they pay it in the increased menu prices instead the only difference i see is the staff are paid more which comes from the customer s pocket due to the guilt associated with it i am not in favour of squeezing money out of ordinary working class citizens to support other workers
i m friends with a girl who works at texas roadhouse while going to college she posts pictures of her tips on snap all the time it ll be like a bill paid with and the receipt just says keep the change she cleans the fuck up and only works wednesday and friday nights
thats the basis of the problem some servers don t want the system to change because they profit off it the whole system is insane buy a bottle of wine tip buy a bottle of wine tip is expected it s not difficult to understand how servers in high end restaurants will never accept any sort of wage because they pull lawyer type money serving expensive bottles and such and employers will too because those servers making thousands in tips a night do so without it costing them a dime and it has other benefits their staff pushing for a quicker turn around because more tables more tips their staff benefiting from upselling customers because of tips the system benefits both parties at the expensive of customers there is plenty of servers who make very little but the discussion often revolves around the ones making big bank in big cities a discussion about a minimum wage for servers will always fail as both those groups have to fit under the same umbrella a server in a diner in a rural town will be ecstatic with hr while a server in a high end bar in nyc laughs as they get twice that in average tips per hour
i think the tipping conversation falls apart because it s framed as tips vs minimum wage ideally without tips pay rates for foh at restaraunts would be a range like any other job at the current place i work i ve tracked my income over the past years and make about hour on average so to change that to just regular minimum wage would be a huge pay cut i would have no problem getting rid of tips if the restaraunt just paid me hour directly
they choose tips look at restaurants that have tried to raise wages and get rid of tipping this https://www.eater.com/21398973/restaurant-no-tipping-movement-living-wage-future) article goes into it a bit they fail to retain employees because employees flee to a tip based establishment where they earn even more restaurant workers love to say the owner is greedy scum but their own behavior highlights their greed too tbh
it depends are you a conventionally attractive person who doesn t mind putting up with sexual harassment from middle aged customers and managers where you can t speak back because the harassers control either the tip or the scheduling to get tips then tipping culture is for you but you can depending on location make per hour it s not a terrible way to go through school in general we should be more concerned with untipped minimum wage jobs typically held by immigrants when thinking about wage reform the dishwasher in the back of the house in general is much worse pf than the wait staff in the front but it s the whole host of min wage jobs that we should be taking about first before the tipping discussion the problems with tipping is that it s mostly racist classist and misogynistic is both it s application and it s history and doesn t actually drive good service it does drive attractive young men and women into the service industry because for low experience part time work it pays good
when i waited tables i tended to bring in hr in tips that was a decade ago and at current time it would need to be closer to hr i imagine servers don t want pay cuts so they wouldn t likely support a hr replacement for tips
most servers would opt to keep tipping i make more as a server than i did as a scientist
they would want when times are slow and tips when things are good just human nature
i think it is entirely dependent on the restaurant you work at i went back to college as an adult and waitressed at a fine dining establishment i averaged around an hour i was willing to take the gamble when people are tipping off bottles of wine and steaks it works out in the servers favor i m sure this is not the case for someone who works at a restaurant that has really low prices
i ve heard former servers say that they like the tipping convention because they make more than they would relying on a standard wage i m trying to figure out if that s true and if so where the boundary is between acceptable and unacceptable pay its a numbers game combined with where you work if you re a waiter at a mid to high end restaurant you absolutely want to keep tipping culture i ve been at business dinners with five people who end up tipping around when all is said and done not bad for an hour and a half nevermind the other tables too they also typically treat you better where it sucks is at the lower end places or places where you get onsies that aren t at the bar if they re ordering a meal and drink they re still going to take minutes to eat but unless they tip its really not worth your while but also remember you re handling multiple tables at once so there is some almost insurance like math that starts to take effect odds are you re not going to have five onsies with small bills at the same time although getting three or four massive people each tables at the same time was enough to make me want to pull my hair out
that depends greatly on where you work what days and how attractive you are
servers labors would find a higher paying job the restaurant system wont work for a lot of places if we get rid of tipping which is fine the business model shouldnt work if you use slave labor however that doesnt mean you get to use a waiters labor without paying for it just because its legal
i d keep tipping until you offered me at least an hour i make so much more than a server would be paid i can t imagine i d secure more than or if it were wage based as a server the tipping system benefits me ridiculously even though i see the obvious criticism problems with it i wouldn t want it for myself any other way
the answer is both they can and do support both a perpetual tipping culture and increased minimum wage
even if they got hr some people would still tip
making including tips per hour is a lower than average day when i was a server bartender ten years ago
i worked at a michelin starred fine dining restaurant all the servers made between 100k to 120k a year bussers made around 80k and food runners made around 55k we would have done it for an hour the strange thing about it for me was that my tip was based on the price of the food or wine the way i serve your wine is the exact same whether it was a bottle of wine or a bottle of wine but the tip was absolutely different plenty of random nights where a waiter would walk out of there with more than 1k in tips it was a wild gig for anyone in the service industry this needs to be a goal and fine dining restaurants are looking for applicants nowadays they can t find enough staff it s wild that anyone would agree to work for anything less during an employee shortage
i ve worked in hospitality years i ve worked essentially every position in a restaurant from manager to dishwasher i currently serve and bartend i would not do my current job for less than an hour if the tip system were removed that would be a decent pay cut but i would take it simply to remove the stigma around my career there s a million ways to break that down we do not receive pto sick time or employer provided health insurance we are not guaranteed a set schedule set hours or set income when i went over my budget and filed my taxes this year i found that over of my take home income last year went towards subsidizing these things that my sister for example has included in her employment at her office job which is why it s absolutely bonkers when i m met with a mob of people online demanding that i go on strike and risk my ability to eat and pay my bills just to get a pay cut afterwards because y all don t like tipping i hear constantly that serving is unskilled work which it can be or cannot be i like to compare it to sales there s the used car salesman at the lemon shop and there s the lamborghini salesman same job title but entirely different things this also goes hand in hand with the tipping system i just think of it as commission when i started serving i worked at a burger bar that only sold beer because of the price point i walked with what would be an hour with inflation which is less than they re hiring at the taco bell down the road and seems more than fair to me since then i ve taken multiple courses on mixology garnered sommelier training i have trained with restaurant consultants on mood setting customer psychology etc with the price points i currently work at i make and hour more when i m able to do what i do best and sell wine a blanket for servers is not that simple there s levels to it that the tipped system allows for based on the price points of the establishment quality servers will not exist in a system where they are not incentivized to do it everyone i work alongside is equally qualified and has similar experience not one of us would do this job we walk miles a day miss weekends and holidays and have to put on the customer service face through it if we re getting a pay cut we ll do what we ve seen our former colleagues do time and time again go into sales or something similar everyone seems to be cool with that i m met with well then everyone will move on and you ll be fine a career i spent years evolving in and mastering but i should just throw that away and move to a desk job so y all can spend more money going out to eat get worse service but not have to do basic math realistically a great solution would be a commission fee added to each bill for dine in guests if you don t want service you can pay for your food and take it to go everyone has a problem with that idea too though so end of rant
i mean if you ask the servers who work at the posh restaurant and get the primo sections on the weekend nights they re gonna say they like their performance based pay if you ask the ones who have to work the weekday swing shift at the local applebees because they haven t gotten an in with management yet they d say they would benefit from a livable hourly wage it s just about understanding that there s more of the second server than the first but the first group are the ones who are instagram influencers and stuff
i worked in serving in and made more than an hour so i would vote to keep it the way it is at nice places in manhattan where i am at the i often drop tips of for a top the bill being around the service is always excellent i do see tipping culture going too far i don t tip for mundane things like a coffee unless its a complex one but i normally order black coffee essentially i tip for table bar service my barber my cabbie and coffee orders that involve more than putting liqui dd into a cup i do if your service is just atrocious if meh for normal if excellent i try very hard to not judge the server for the fuckups of the kitchen ect but i also have little respect for poorly managed businesses because it really isn t that difficult to take orders and deliver a correct product
during high school early college i worked a mexican restaurant i remember on weekends our servers would make up to a night and on a slow day around i doubt they would take the hourly

servers don t benefit from it servers benefit from consistent wages if servers didn t like tipping they could certainly shift the industry there s truth in this statement but it also seems remarkably naive the truth is they could collectively bargain for a decent wage the naivety is that folks still gotta eat
you can t lump every server in with those who make a pay period in cities at full service establishments maybe a nice busy bar maybe but dude i have worked service in rural places where they are barely pulling in a night i have worked counter service at events where i was expecting to be tipped and nobody does and every server i know that has weekend nights also has days or even entire seasons where business is slow and there s no cash flow at all beyond the measly checks
i think you re misunderstanding just how huge the service sector is though garbage collectors are a much smaller group one that can and does collectively bargain through striking etc for better wages and conditions at least here in philly and i support them when they do the size of the industry and the high turnover rate for the jobs doesn t lend itself to internal reform the same way an industry like waste management does also the size of the service sector means that many of us have actually worked in the industry meaning we re not making random guesses about what these people make or being condescending by tipping not sure where you got that argument but it s weak and seems disingenuous
agree i have never had an issue tipping at a restaurant or something like that even throw down a few bucks on pick up now i get hit up for tips at head shops the place i by coffee beans by the the pound
definitely right but for me it good to be give other people tip so they can give a lot of money to their family
i think people will just change their behavior they will go to chipotle or panda express even if its lower quality because those places don t require tip as a result more mom pop restaurants will go bell up so corporate chains have the upper hand and benefit the most from tip culture
let s just get our own fucking food how about that
i just got for no tip when the screen is turned
turns out a lot of people don t have time to make food at home or they are on lunch break so don t have time to go all the way home make food and rush back to work especially if they have a long commute also some people suck at making food the industry can be toxic sure but any workplace can be toxic there s just a lot more places to eat because you know everyone eats every day multiple times
even though the bendors you can gave them a money either
pretty much this used to dine out all the time up until the pandemic and then remembered i m a good cook while on lockdown restaurants reopened and both the food and service have been garbage and now it seems workers want to be tipped on a bill fuck outta here with that also if a bartender isn t doing anything more than opening a bottle of beer no more than one dollar on a drink
but if you tip
no shit
i don t need a study to know that my ass hole is bleeding and i can t afford health care thanks daddies you know how to treat a peasant right

in this confusing world their motivation just stays at the safety level hence we get billionaires acting like chipmunks by stashing their wealth forever
if you feed enough oats to the horse some will pass through to feed the sparrows john galbraith
wow this is worthless do we need studies on this i mean trickle down has been disproven like times maybe even over even a single hour collating this data was an absolute waste i need to get into the no shit studies department and charge some dem think tank like 900k for it
if the top disappeared the world would be just fine if the rest of us stopped existing then mankind would go extinct soon after so why should they hold a majority of the wealth and force the rest of us to fight amongst ourselves for scraps
the trickle down idea was used by kings in europe right before the french revolution
well when does the trickle down happen exactly when we re all fcking dead every institution in america is broken this isn t abt fcking republicans democrats they re all shit they get richer richer and preach to us abt fcking sacrifice
my expression on hearing this earth shattering revelation
i wish you would attach the study that is referenced
it is interesting they are sanitizing the results by saying it s true the rich keep the wealth and the bottom half does not get anything in reality get nothing while the hoard their wealth
interesting thing to note if government gives poor people money it becomes a true trickledown economy because they spend what they have how do you do that increase the minimum wage jobs are not lost like small businesses want you to believe i guess the billions in profits along with ppp loan fraud doesn t convince you or the tons of bailout money they give companies who promptly give bonuses to the officers before declaring the company bankrupt
time for revolution french style
in other news bears still shit in the woods
we knew this when reagan was preaching it the whole idea of referring to ultra rich as job creators is disingenuous bullshit the gop waves around more like job destroyers because they will lay off thousands without losing a wink of sleep
wow what a scoop
i m shocked shocked well not that shocked
is there a picture of el n where he doesn t look like a total tool
you needed a study maybe just check your bank account
why can t we just call things what they are the fact that people get so politically correct about trickle down is such an absurdity to me makes no sense at all if you really want to get politically incorrect it used to be called horse and sparrow theory feed a horse oats and some of those oats pass through to the sparrows in shit there is no evidence whatsoever that supply side economics if you re going to be pc about it has any actual supply side effects either it s all on the demand side and it s so weak to be laughable if not for the broader starve the beast ideological project which goes something like get into government run it like crap on purpose cut taxes to explode the deficit then claim we need to cut spending especially education medicare medicaid and social security because look hey the government is running badly and the deficit is big it s such an obvious game the moment you just pay any attention to it why would a tax cut even spur capital investment why wouldn t a rich person or a business just take out a loan to raise capital return on investment is entirely separate from taxes because taxes only apply after profits and all business expenses are tax deductible in the first place a tax cut just means they keep more profits and income for themselves and if their incomes already support having all the resources to satisfy their desires then what do they do with it nothing marginal propensity to consume is inverse with income money matters more the less a person has what is someone with a high enough income to sustain a personal savings rate of or more going to buy if they had more dollars this is obviously very different for someone with a savings rate near which is where most people actually are
is it time to eat the uber wealthy yet
if you don t work for these people they can t make money it has to become fashionable to look down at people that work for companies or people that work against the interests of the people everyone at goldman sachs is a karen if people can create memes like the karen one but about corporate people i think i could work the rich will never be benevolent your skills are needed give them to someone else
most of bro they re taking all the gains and then some people are getting pay cuts for wages that have been stagnant for decades and i m not even talking about inflation
been going on for millenia can we finally take out these rich assholes next time i see that dumbfuck musk s face while scrolling social media it better be a rip haha
i hate capitalism and i hate elon musk i really hope i don t banned for saying that
poverty we have said elsewhere was the primary cause of wealth it was poverty that created the first capitalist because before accumulating surplus value of which we hear so much men had to be sufficiently destitute to consent to sell their labour so as not to die of hunger it was poverty that made capitalists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread#toc34
we don t need any more reports or research or data to tell us what we already know every day these guys earn the same amount as some small nations it is insane we need to fix this
unbelievable how many ppl fall for it and for so long
wonder who got paid millions of dollars for this common sense study
in other news water is wet
how many times will it be debunked before it changes trick question it ll never change
there is no such theory as trickle down economics it s made up never was just another lie
these studies be like humans have been needing oxygen to survive for at least the last three decades
it doesn t take 20yrs to notice this
it seriously took them years to see this
this was known years ago in fact people have been screaming it since trickle down economics entered the american english lexicon
most most fuck you is not most it is all i wanna punch in the face whoever wrote that headline with most of my strength
it baffles me to think some people still think that somehow giving more money to the rich will magically make them more generous and make jobs for no reason the rich will never share or give away money unless they re forced jobs are created only in response to demand more demand more jobs to meet demand demand is a result of customers spending money more spending buying more demand so logically the best way to build the economy is by giving the money to the people who will actually spend it the customers turns out what anyone with common sense knew all along was true the economy doesn t work from the top down but from the bottom up
holy shit no way
and that picture right there children is one of a smug self important douche
this took a study of years
whaaaaat
the bigger the snowball rolling down a hill the more snow it gathers along the way
lmao
in other news water wet sun bright fire hot more at
i ve got my hot sauce ready
when s the feast bbq cookout is it a potluck not sure a b y o r would work
this is brand new information
also found out water is wet and the sun is hot
only took them yes to figure it out
duh
the biggest question will anything change for improvement
trickle up economics
you know at some point they re right it is our fault there s more of us this shouldn t happen but it does it does because we not only allow it but we are the chains that bind us
the last forty years or so have been a big fat back and forth between economists who knew trickle down theory was bullshit and businessmen who also knew it was bullshit but cared very much about making everybody else thinking it worked this isn t new information it s just that economists tend to have a less expansive dissemination platform than dudes with millions of dollars to burn
whoa no way
the spin to this is them saying that opposing trickle down economics is class warfare
i mean obviously but it s nice to start seeing it legitimized
everyone knows that money never trickles down because of all the money dams that exist if anything money trickles up almost a hundred years ago will rogers suggested giving money to the poor by the end of the day every penny would have trickled up but at least it would have been in the hands of someone who actually got some use out of it
yea no shit ya think so
gosh what a surprise
the biggest con held with the biggest take over of power from the riches
for most countries keep your eye on the national debt ball it ain t going to be pretty wonder how the rich folks will survive curious
so no news there
if i could get a government grant i d like to do another year study to verify this
look folks we ve had some bad years of economic crashes and stuff lately there would be more trickle down but all these black sparrow events keep it from happening economists don t know why the line crashes sometimes we just have to keep up the hope in the almighty dollar and above all else capitalism s juuuust in case
what an utter wank stain musk is
we needed a huge study to tell us that
he just works harder then you
it s actually really embarrassing anyone believed it to begin with
ya think morons
honestly i love the fact that elon musk is now the poster boy for the rich out of touch elites hoarding wealth from the rest of us fuck elon musk
and yet they only studied the past years not when the concept originated
really needed years study it is all bulshit
people like musk think that it s for the good of everyone for him to have all the money he s clearly so much smarter than everyone even though what we ask is a pittance compared to what the rich hoard
in other news i just completed a study of years worth of data and concluded that water is in fact wet
new study just in the sun rises in the east
duh
this study was conducted alongside another big study on if water is wet
i ve seen the freaking title for yrs
it took them years to figure that shit out
hey look the sky is blue
over a decade ago when i was in college studying economics it had been years since reagan and years since nixon trickle down proponents and we knew that then in in college based on that shit people don t care because people don t know how to fight it we need to organize we need to shit on bootlickers there are countries that the us has dismantled with higher worker representation literally chile
well i m shocked shocked
blame reagan
government chose the peak economist based on it knowing the plan would suit it we chose the wrong fucking guy on purpose
but wen u give them tax breaks they spend it on locally owned fruit vendors
well get living wages when we re dead
for those who are too young to remember there were jokes about trickled on economics
years it s been at least years of this bs another crappy thing to thank ronald reagan for
just pass on one more raise while they bump prices up one more time and give them one more bailout then it ll trickle down we swear
there are many 3conomic theories that sou d good and sou d like they would work however greed wins all the time if the trickle went down to the employees ans dropped prices of goods we would have more but it doesn t
eat the rich tax the fuckers
trickle down economics where they piss on your head and you get whatever rolls off
we needed a year study to show us that
what do y all think about that uh reaganomics bullshit from one of eddie murphy s specials almost years ago i think we know it doesn t work
a small benefit but not to be abused another benefit but not every week great pos
dont do it the probation is just to buy time for him to find a replacement she ll be let go before the days
garbage incentives
tell the boss to go on their computer and then open a web browser and go to amazon and then search for kite on amazon and then find one under and then add to cart and check out they may have to get their credit card out and send it to their home and when it arrives open the package and read the instructions and put the kit together and then go outside and go fly a kite
so if you stay you won t get your own office and will have to fight for the and will never get your own office these are all ifs and buts
thats so weak my brain read it as benefits 1x small happy meal notes at employees expense meal will not be happy
was there a pay increase money talks etc
day prob after working there already wow what a deal s ofc
nope that s a whole lot of nope please read the following in your best internal game show announcer voice except where the most condescending voice you can use is appropriate you ll know twenty one hours pto not even full hour shifts plus we ll add more hours onto the total every year wait 18m for an office we hope you totally forget about this we certainly will but wait there s more we might let you work from home if the mood strikes us it s feb 31st we ll let you set your own hours but not like that just once in a while maybe every 42nd tuesday all this and moar could be yours provided you survive another day probationary period and if you act now we ll throw in the added stress of a yearly review provided we care to remember unused broom closet on the 2nd floor that smells of rodents has a ceiling leak who cares that you re a valued member of our team family insert random bullshit word here that s been here for years already jump through the hoop ambiguous date to be determined at our leisure
laughs in european
words she needs to say before reminding the boss when her last day is fuck you pay me
this is the funniest shit i ve ever seen it may as well say shit like your own coffee mug years from now you can walk to work if you want on your own time snickers bar fun size not full size unlimited bathroom breaks limited to once per shift
getting put back on probation in exchange for retractable non benefits oh yes please my slimy lord and master let me hitch my knees so you can f me a little deeper how stupid do they think we are
all of this is far too vague only weeks of pto each year and a lot of maybe s is all i see
my response would be simply
those are some really weak benefits
no pay increase x200b wtf is this office in months or prob no office and no x200b day probation x200b literally trying to keep you so he can fire you while he looking for someone else run from this hell
the inability to control the indents on their bullet points is screaming boomer
this reads as please give me days to find your replacement and fire you with no notice
wait she has to go through a day probationary period for these incentives to kick in she s gotta re tryout for these benefits that are suppose to persuade her to stay what a moron
where is the starbucks card really need to step it up
hours is this a typo and they meant days
that day probation period screams i m goiyto try and find a replacement in days i just need you to stay while i look
respond with flexibility of hours i get my job done and i can t do what the fuck i want don t need extra pto if i can set my own schedule work from home opportunity indefinitely if that s what your wife would prefer don t need my own office in years or in addition more money you dope
hours of pto as in three days per year also not to be abused will directly translate into if you try to use it we will call that abusing it
all promises no cash pay me
really putting on the full court press lol jesus i m surprised it didn t include a personalized coffee mug only don t break it
her boss is hilariously out of touch
she wouldn t get that office within months that alternative likewise wouldn t ever actually be paid out he d always have an excuse ready about the quarterly budget not having it available
hours pto after days after 2nd yearly review max after 4th yearly review bonus at each yearly review if not assigned an office defined flexibility of hours defined wfh opportunities terms effective immediately play some ball
my job has this unlimited pto policy but don t abuse it well my wife is due to have a baby in a few months they give weeks to fathers i asked for another weeks using pto to have a full month off denied said i d be at risk of losing my job keep in mind i only have days total taken off this year so it would be a total of weeks of pto in one year unlimited right
this is the funniest shit i ve read all day is the boss mr krabs from spongebob
boss is going to spend the days looking for her replacement
i was like wow hours but that s literally days
almost three whole days of vacation wow you just feel like cinderella
change the paid time off hours to days and i d sign instantly
hours of pto max i currently have like hours of pto my cap is hours wtf
i d hand this paper back to him with a bottle of ky and kindly inform him of where to stick it
he will honor absolutely none of this once he thinks the other position is filled with someone else tell her to bounce now
so basically nothing
they should have tried and the magic word
they aren t going to give her an office they might give her the bonus if she makes a big stink about it which will not endear her to anyone flexible hours yeah right wfh maybe i d never agree to another probation period
benefits free lunch will not be every week depends on how fast i fill my punch card
flexible hours unless i don t like it
not even regular wfh day a week is pretty substandard
what no pizza party
peace out girl scout
wow don t miss out on that opportunity that months will zoom by
too little too late bye enjoy the new job
nope time to move on
never take the counter offer
their counter offer is worse than some companies standard benefit offer
hours i thought it was days at first
i like that the level of professionalism is consistent between the content and the format s
they will use the days to hire a replacement and let her go it would be best to move on
pto hours dafuq
wow that is a really pathetic offer just the pto alone is kind of an insult anyway i bet he would fire her a month down the road just so that she is screwed
wtf is with pto hours like you can take two and 8ths of a day off
fuck that day probation period lol
wildly vague and intentionally insulting imo
the insult to my integrity and work ethic was noted
she should run
wow so lavish i hope the boss doesn t bankrupt the company with such rich bennies
y is there a need for probation period something is fishy
lmao i feel like some work from home days is like two
don t go here s something to make you reconsider it s dogshit benefits
if i put it in bullet points it ll look official and seem appealing
probationary period is a red flag you re already working there what probationary this dude is gonna fire her as soon as a replacement is found and gonna try to deny unemployment
probation period for a job she already has and i assume has been working for some time what a dingus
how about no
i take it she s still laughing at the pathetic offer i d hate to know she currently has if that of is an upgrade
never believe anything that is supposedly going to happen in the future like the office or the bonus they always find a reason why that just isn t possible right now
i don t know the circumstances here but i had to do stuff like this when i was a manager sometimes pizza parties and small benefits like this are a company shitting on you sometimes they re a manager making like an hour more than you paying for gift cards at christmas for the whole team out of pocket ordering worth of pizza out of pocket and birthday cakes that are allergen sensitive and covering for extra wfh time because they care more than the owner does maybe this is the company s dime and that s what the manager thinks is enough maybe this is the most they can get away with without someone who cares less noticing i don t have the information on this don t know the boss but sometimes stupid small benefits and perks like this are a disgrace from the company and sometimes it s a manager who cares a ton being willing to live off healthy choice steamers for a week to celebrate you
hey in my office they mostly only give private offices to people who make over million but i do get that most other places aren t midtown manhattan overlooking central park and real estate isn t over a square foot per year
a lot of maybe probablies in there
this is sad what kinda job
gee what an enticing counteroffer lmao
i hope the crumples in the paper are from her wadding it up and throwing it in her boss s eye
sounds purposefully ambiguous so she will never know what s actually acceptable and he can move the goal posts whenever he wants because there is no actual agreement laid out to be struck
that is so sad
not trying very hard
hmmmm is this benefitting any more than what she is originally getting if not better to move on
probation and then hey you are not doing well so taking away these benefits
bye bye bye sing it like nsinq would
a lot of open ended ideas he s left himself an out for literally everything dudes a clown show she should leave now and never look back
boss confirmed it s time for you to bounce
not trying very hard are they
wow pto hours a year the legal minimum here is hours that s not an incentive it s an insult
cute
naaaah byyyyeeeeeeee
just tell her to write hard no on the note and leave that she ain t getting an office and not and that month probationary period is for them to find a replacement
i hope she laughed in his face and gave her notice good luck to her
tell your wife that this is a trap now that her employer knows she s looking elsewhere they might hit back and fire her out of spite if she stays whenever employers come back with a counteroffer it always backfires
ha ha ha ha ha
pitiful
i think he s trying to incentivize her to leave
is this real as in somebody actually put this together and was like no way they ll pass this sweet ass deal up i can see what she thought about it since it looks like it was crinkled up and then smoothed out to share here haha i say go with that instinct
anytime the boss offers a bunch of stuff after you give your notice the questions have to be where was all this before now do i have to give my notice every time i want to see some progress
this is so insane yesterday than my current gig i ll take it if she doesnt
where are the incentives
this is where you get the help of friends people that your boss doesn t know have them come in as customers who notice you are sick and then raise the roof and ask to speak to the manager then they can berate and chastise the manager for having a sick employee on duty also have them record the encounter and drop hints of calling a lawyer or suing or calling the health dept etc you could also quit if it s easier i just like the thought of messing with ass managers like this
make it public throw up in front of customers if you re feeling light headed and are going to pass out make sure it s in the middle of the dining room that way you have a case if they try to fire you over it
when i was i was at work and began having a miscarriage on black friday i was having contractions so painful i fell to my knees at the register customers went to find help and my boss came and told me to suck it up i did eventually get sent home when the sanitary napkin i d borrowed didn t hold up and i was visibly bleeding my boss was annoyed i was faint and could barely drive myself home i had to go to the hospital that night i lost so much blood and along with that i had to cope with not just the savage grief of losing a child i d wanted but also the complexity of not being allowed to care for myself while it was happening i really think that my situation being minimized made it harder for me to heal i was unwell for months afterward and mentally fragile for years i should have left that day i don t know why i told you this fuck that boss though fuck your boss for not prioritizing your health
i work retail i m the only closer scheduled in my department night shift has four employees one cashier one customer service one in misses jr mens me one in home kids and one manager i called out yesterday because i have fever sore throat and runny nose took a home covid test negative so it s just the crud thankfully store gm i hope you feel better get some rest we got this this morning i still feel like ass so i called out again store gm i hope you feel better get some rest we got this my boss is a unicorn and i know it
absolutely disgusting but hey we are the nutbags who believe that a a sick human deserves rest and healing b the public should not be exposed to getting sick c dollars are not more important than the health of your employees and d that your manager should do their gd job and find coverage if that s what they re worried about pos walk out edited bc i lost my point of the way through
dude go home and call the health department do not throw up on a customer norovirus is super contagious and going around like crazy you not only need to take care of yourself but if that s what you have you could really be putting others at risk my healthy year old friend ended up admitted to the hospital with sepsis due to a secondary infection they contracted as a result of norovirus my healthy year old partner was close to being hospitalized and was seriously ill and unable to work for over a week because of it he s still having trouble keeping certain kinds of foods down weeks later just because your boss won t do the right thing doesn t mean you shouldn t
throw up on a patrons table and then say you were told to come to work or be fired
puke on the bosses desk
if you are working in food service call the health department on your boss and get the place shut down for a week legally you can t work around food if you have thrown up in the last hours
have a friend call the inspector and report a severely ill employee working with the food
look you re deathly in throwing up and have already passed out workman s comp will cover you if you suffered a lost consciousness injury at work you should probably meet with an attorney about your options i know healthcare is expensive and ridiculous in the usa but you re boss is risking your health to fill a spot go take care of yourself get a doctor s note call the health department to let them know that your company is fine having you serve people sick as a dog call osha passing out at work is a recordable event
honestly throw up around patrons that will cause far more damage from word of mouth than anything else you purposefully could do anyone that comes to work where i am at since i am in charge of the shift i am in sick like this and passes out will be sent to the hospital no questions asked and refusal isn t an option the company will pay the emergency room bill because they forced the worker to come in i would personally see to it
time to find something else it sounds i d walk out of it were me that s just torture
forced to work while sick that sounds like information the customers need
what customer wants a sick server seriously your boss is an asshole i would call the department of health how can they promote someone with a fever and fainting serving customers call and report these imbiciles
osha osha osha osha osha osha passing out on the job continuing to work is a big no no heavy equipment operators won t do it and neither should you
did they not learn anything from the pandemic at all how easy it is to die if you get exposed to someone with or without symptoms
let your boss think what she wants just go home and take care of yourself
where do you work i ll call and complain about the sick employee i just saw
get one of your mates to come in posing as a karen and berate them for letting you work
advise him that if something happens to you he is liable as you advised him of feeling ill if you passed out and this boss is still being a dick you need to quit i never give that recommendation but this is not acceptable he doesn t own you or anyone
y know what s always worked for me everytime throw up on her fucking shoes you ll be sent home before you get done puking and ffs don t feel remotely bad about it you re sick
faint go to the hospital make them pay for it as a work related incident
patrons suggests you re in food service call the health department inform them what s going on
find a new job op your boss clearly couldn t care less if you re sick pale vomiting your guts out and is willing to spite you just for taking a day off for being sick find a better place to work with a boss that ll treat you like an actual human being
your boss s boss needs to be notified that they are endangering you and the business fever generally indicated contagious so your boss is inviting you to infect all of the customers from a stewardship standpoint toward the business customers and you the employee that is egregious
have yo tried throwing up on your boss
i do believe this is if not lawsuit territory then some major fine territory you do not force someone to work when you re sick
honestly i d either call the health department yourself or i d have a family member or friend do it also report to osha and maybe even your corporate office this is obviously big middle manager energy i guarantee you that corporate doesn t want to deal with a lawsuit or fines from osha to keep you working
leave and go directly to the er or urgent care hey documentation if they fire you file for unemployment if they try to claim it s for cause you ll have documentation also get a new job
i d put a bucket near me in full view of customers and puke in it while i work if anyone asks tell them your manager won t let you leave
i d vomit where everyone can see them pass out on the floor
i mean i m guessing he s right cause who actually wants to work however the question is should you be at work and obviously that s a no i m still wondering who these people are who love their job so much and actually ever want to be there
find a new job where you won t be treated like this go home today take care of yourself and then start looking if she fires you collect your unemployment until you start a new job
don t ask to leave don t ask for time off inform them yhat you re taking your time that is not a sustainable work place to be in definitely look for another job because that is straight up abusive and blatant disregard to your health and well being you sound seriously i ll especially if you re passing out too please head home op get unemployment and find a better job
whatever you have sounds contagious fever gi constitutional symptoms and we are seeing norovirus which is severe and potentially fatal in vulnerable people also it is airborne your boss is a fool for exposing herself your coworkers and your customers go home drink fluids and electrolytes over the counter benadryl may help with nausea and vomiting imodium ad for diarrhea go to er if you are not urinating much or at all you may need iv fluids to feel better and to protect your kidneys from being damaged by dehydration i hope you feel better soon
throw up on him
this is all good advice on this post but i would also like to suggest you not include some biological agents left in her personal space saliva on the doorknob to her office coughing over everything you can like keyboard phone keys favourite mug etc anything she touches often because you absolutely definitely don t want her to find out exactly how sick you are for herself
vomit on her desk
why dont we all put up google reviews about how this restaraunts has sick people around the food
like other people said report it to the health department also is this a franchise or chain file a formal complaint with corporate i think they would be interested if a franchise representing them has a manager forcing an employee to work with a possibly infectious disease go to the er or urgent care get a formal diagnosis include that in the complaint
this is where you make a complaint to the state
wait so you are going through this at work currently are struggling to stay conscious not throw up and incredibly pale yet took the time to write this post out in between vomiting and passing out i guess without a single typo or urgency in your context well done
next time you puke aim at her
go home immediately don t let your illness spread
you passed out and they didn t get you any medical attention make sure one of your coworkers knows to call or whatever number gets emergency services if it happens again and by if i mean when you fake passing out in front of the manager and customers so that ems gets called
assert dominance go in to talk to your boss and throw up on their desk or on them
you decide what you do everything else is only a suggestion
if i were op i would have dropped in the floor and wouldn t respond for a bit and then waited until getting wheeled into a hospital from a paramedics car because op is barely holding on and can drop on the floor and have severe complications because of the sickness any time then at a hospital i would tell the doctor my boss refused to grant me a day off delisted me being severely sick i would get that in writing i would have also asked the doc whether he thought working while having my symptoms was safe most likely he would say no i would then send an email to hr cc my piece of sh t boss and explain what happened i would mention that i m now at a hospital and not sure when i will get out of get better i would say that s according to the doctor my boss forced me to work while being severely sick creating unsafe and borderline life threatening conditions if the doctor also said my working worsened my sickness and overall health that goes in the email too i would demand to launch an investigation and also loop in a legal team to explain how come my employers acts against the health code and basic human rights but let me guess i m sure this isn t the first time your boss does this and it s also not the only morally ugly thing he s done how about you make a list for the hr and legal p s get better and don t you dare go back to work
if you work in the food industry call your local health department and say you have the symptoms of a foodborne illness and are being forced to work with food they have hours to investigate and if you can prove that your boss was making you work sick they will crack down source am a food safety inspector
this is where you toss your cookies in front of everyone or in your bosses office you said your sick they called your bluff time to follow through
how can you write this long post if you re sick enough to be puking and passing out
you re right boss i don t want to work now i want to fight
when you feel like your gonna throw up again go to your boss and do it on her shoes
not too sick to write this novel lol
this sub is always gold for a laugh your managers wrong though it s not just this generation it s been that way for as long as i ve been managing everybody just wanna go stay home and be lazy some things never change also if i had passed out i d be going to the emergency room and that s why i don t believe you bye
time to anonymously call the health department and throw up in front of them
are you in some type of food operation throw up directly on the line of food items proves your point and the owner will have to throw away the whole line and lose money
op please ensure that you vomit in public you know uncontrollable reflex and all and if possible on the boss
it sounds like you re working in food service if so call the health department and report the business for requiring you to work while sick usually just threatening to do this will result in being told to go home
for all you anti union guys this why you want to be union if i get a hang nail i can go home right now
did you get tested for the flu or covid having one of those come back positive and then recording your manager threatening to fire you for calling out is definitely a violation of your rights as a worker i d also contact the hr department for the company and record everything via email or text conversation also look up your state to see if it s a one party consent state for audio recordings bonus if these convos happen in front of the in store audio and video recordings so the business has a record of them being discriminatory towards employees
just saying if you fall down at work cuz you re too ill and hurt yourself it s worker s comp injuries from the fall at least
to the patrons hey sorry if i seem a little less energetic today guys i m really sick but my boss says i have to cover i ll try my best
call say you re about to pass out that your boss won t let you leave and you need urgent care see her change her mind in a second
next time you puke make sure it s in front of people customers and boss would be preferred
just leave and go directly go to the doctor if you get in trouble find some legal representation in any situation dealing with food that i m aware of any visible symptoms of illness should ve made the manager send you home
just leave if your employer works you while you re sick that s not someone you want to work for why are you risking your limited health so karen can make a buck and talk shit get a doctors note asap and apply for literally anything else
don t throw up on anyone just go home rest until you re well tell your boss don t ask that you re not well enough to work and you ll let them know when you ll be back ignore all replies if they fire you for being sick collect unemployment and find a better job
barf on her
if you re a server tell your tables i m sorry but i feel like i need to inform you that i am sick but my manager is forcing me to come in or threatening to fire me so i have no choice i m really sorry
eat some red candies or cough drops when you puke on her she ll think it s blood
you just gotta let that puke fly seriously if you re feeling sick and are going to puke just puke since your boss doesn t wanna take it seriously show her how serious it is same accounts for bathroom breaks if they ever tell you no shit yourself on the spot then you get to go home and the manager now just made someone shit puke in public for everyone to see
you could just go say your going home your not enslaved if you get fired go above your bosses head and ream him out to his boss find a new job your current on sucks or take my route get close and puke on his legs and shoes
go throw up on his desk
fucking stay and get that worker s comp fuck her when her negligence blows up in her face just be as helpful to her as she is to you
throw up on your manger s desk
who is your boss s manager this needs to go up the line until someone up the chain does the right thing i would never tolerate one of my managers acting like this if you are sick you need to stay home i would want to know if i had a manager behaving like this to an employee she he needs coaching and or retraining and or firing
all these responses are too complicated walk out go to urgent care get a sick note if you re fired contact your local dol wage hour division rep
vomit on your boss
yikes just last friday i started feeling sick and unwell and even though i did my best to finish my day i had to go see my boss and say i m unwell i think i m getting sick i ll be heading home and he just responded oh ok take care of yourself and that was it i ended up calling off my 2nd job that was all weekend long and missing days of work in total no issues no doctor notes shenanigans just a call i m sick can t come in sorry i m sorry for anyome who has to deal with bosses like this they deserve to lose their businesses
i know this wouldn t be reasonable but i so badly want to say just throw up in front of patrons and then loudly apologize and explain that your boss demands that you work while sick enough to pass out to prove that you re not lazy and totally not because she can t be bothered to find someone to cover your shift or god forbid do it herself
puke on your manager offer up a meek sorry after you splatter them
friend of mine s husband told me about the time he asked his supervisor to go home sick and the supervisor said he didn t look sick so he puked on his shoes got sent home sick maybe you won t make it to the restroom in time the next time just saying
this hit so hard i m immunocompromised and was forced to work months straight with pneumonia numerous times while i was throwing up throughout the day severe strep pregnancy complications etc i thought i was miscarrying at one point called my doctor and was told to rush to the hospital and instead was yelled at by my manager that if i was having a miscarriage it was my fault and maybe if i caught it sooner and tried harder i wouldn t be miscarrying i work at a daycare btw
kids these days always passing out from exhaustion
puke on her shoes she deserves to smell like the puke of a human she is
have you tried puking on your boss
teacher had zero tolerance absence policy unless i could get a docters note i came into class with my gf and fever my gf took notes and when the teacher asked why i told her so class continued while i sneezed coughed and hacked my runny nose was wiped on tissues and my sweatshirts i was highly contagious lol during break the class stood in line and told the teacher i need to go home and go home now i did policy changed after that
fake story lol
just throw up in front of her or better yet on her
hello i m pretty knowledgeable about these things take a look into fmla laws policies in your state what you should do is get into contact with whoever handles fmla and medical stuff just let them know you need all the medical documents so your doctor can fill them out since you will be taking an approved leave now when you go to your doctor explain what s going on and let them know you re taking a leave for months that s the max for short term the doctor will fill this out for you if you re really having issues then you can go figure out what s wrong and by law you should get paid of your wages now you have to look into your state laws because mine my be different i ve worked hr for years so if you let me know your state i can find you more resources document everything right now for the evitable lawsuit you will need to file in the future i ve helped friends get very big settlements their lawyers do all the leg work ofc after the fact but if they violate fmla laws you re in for a payday
vomit on your boss
straight up puke in front of customers she ll send you home real quick
but you manage to log on here while apparently on the job to leave a detailed description of your ongoing malady
why tolerate this go get a different job no job is worth dealing with a manager like that unless you are making a ton of money
next time you feel yourself about to throw up you know where to aim
throw up on her shoes betting she ll send you home then
you seem concerned about almost throwing up in front of patrons why you re clearly sick you ve told your manager you are sick and you re still forced to serve customers next time you feel it coming up while you are with customers just let it fly what is your manager going to do fire you for having the illness you warned her you had frankly she d be doing you a favor but i imagine she ll be too busy with the health department and a bunch of angry customers at that point
just throw up infront of the patrons tell them you arent allowed to leave wait for karen to call for the manager
word also what are those
i worked a short stint in a factory making nozzles for medical reagent tanks each nozzle was about wholesale i made one every seconds it was two pieces of plastic which screwed together and had to be torqued to a very specific point with a rubber o ring seemed fairly cheap to produce
this get posted frequently but no idea what s being produced
the naysayers need to shut the fuck up obviously he doesn t deserve the full value of what he produces everybody realizes that there are more steps in the process don t act like that s some magic bullet to this argument he and everybody else responsible for making the product absolutely deserve more than a mere of the value created there s no fucking way that even when you consider the bottom line these workers aren t getting fucked every job deserves a thriving wage not a living wage a thriving one and theres no fucking reason it can t be done other than pure greed
i work at the warehouse i can demolish goods worth more than my month s pay in a matter of seconds
wtf even is that
i see this a lot and still have zero idea what the fuck those even are
extracting that surplus labor value
i know it s not really to the point but what the hell are those
we have operators at my work making well over orings a day making an hour it s fucked
cock rings
capitalism will argue do you make of them by hand individually all by yourself do you purchase the raw materials for them do you put them on the market yourself do you make deals with suppliers of the raw materials needed to make them do you use a machine that you spent money or made yourself to make them faster did you do the research and development to make them did you require training to make those if the truck carrying them to market falls off a bridge do you lose money ultimately there is a long supply chain and a lot of people in that chain so it may be true he can crank out of them it s not just him that made the but it could be dozens or even hundreds of other people to and everybody in that chain deserves a piece of the pie too it s a complex system with a lot of people involved i don t believe he made and sold those all by himself at every part of the process
honest question i ve posted here before about my own work issues i m not a troll how does this factor in the equipment and supplies that the company pays for so that workers can make them what does the math come out to
they are that much at the part store but on a new bike the company probably adds cents to the cost of the bike
how much does it take to produce them
what are those things
do you own that plant factory you work in
i currently make lighting fixtures as an example build one of the fixtures in minutes it sells for dollars
what s with the spike in people using ironically unironically lately
but he does not pay for the building materials etc it s not a great argument for better pay
at least he can still buy what he produces i ve been working on military frigates i can t afford a battleship xd
what are they do you gather all the raw materials and make them with your bare hands in that time or are you just adding value to things by crafting them into another form a jewelry maker can make a ring worth 10k in one hour that doesn t mean they get paid that much per day a line cook can cook dollars worth of steak in a shift that doesn t mean they created the steaks
i mean where is the plastic coming from what machinery is being used to make them who is transporting the raw materials who is transporting the finished good packaging sales and marketing warehousing yea might be that this one guy actually does stamp out of these doo dads every hour but there are other people in the pipeline that are helping to deliver this product to the end user
not by hand or solo this post is very naive
the people actually making the products being sold are the ones the most undervalued and are also the most necessary and vital to the entire production system
this is the most economically ignorant post i ve seen in this forum how much does the equipment cost to make these the facility the molds for the equipment the insurance the marketing the hr the distribution costs materials for production ignorant or disingenuous arguments like this are the reason that businesses can get away with not paying a decent wage because anyone with even the slightest common sense knows it is complete bs
deleted
does he procure the materials and build every tool necessary for the job he should split the merit with all those that contributed sounds more reasonable then
how much do you have invested in the company
because profit and labor costs are the only things that make up pricing for an item self explanatory
do you by yourself make of them an hour or do you operate a machine that costs a million dollars has a mandatory service contract yearly to fix any problems and maintain the machine get a free supply of materials to work with that others had to provide and a multitude of other things that increase the cost of the product yes workers need an increase of wages but this picture is just some dumb shit
but how many hours would it take to afford the facility and machinery to produce an hour on his own
this is however extremely reductive at the very least op should consider that he also would have to afford the machine allowing him to crank them out at hour and finely machined too
homie don t make shit he loads the material in the machine selects a program written by a process engineer or the guy that was there when the machine was bought who deserves more money and hopefully has loaded the material correctly and is using the proper tools but the tool is probably selected by the program and loaded to the spindle with a tool changer then he unloads the parts so he loads stock and unloads parts from a cnc any of you can start that job tomorrow
i doubt he painstakingly made these he s a button pusher or machine loader as others have mentioned the building the or figure machine that actually makes the part materials cost cost to not somebody to acquire materials somebody to box these up transport them to where they get final assembled all the people handling the administrative side of it the fact that he probably doesn t only just make of these an hour hours a week for an indefinite amount of time because not that many motorcycles are being built so he probably has to do other things at times and oh yeah all of the hundreds of other more or less complicated pieces that need to be individually made in several other buildings by many other manufacturers to make the entire motorcycle that needs to even exist for this part to be needed that then needs buildings and employees to be sold and serviced i get it the op doesn t feel fulfilled that s on him go change the world if you are so inclined that s the real problem here not evil capitalism
the machines the facility the logistics the electricity the materials it goes on and on he s a very small part of the process
plus marketing plus shipping plus plus the building you use to build them plus the tools you worked with to make them plus the training it took to teach you to make them plus the resources used to make them plus plus plus
hurdurhur i make cars every day that means every hour i should be give car
seems like something which could be 3d printed
well shit
surplus value is basically what they re describing
basics of marxism
i used to work at lowe s and always felt this way i d see cool shit i wanted but could never be able to afford
owners take home far too much profit
he should just get paid the full value of everything he makes if the managers want some profit they need to come in and personally run the machines otherwise they should get nothing
i work two hours before being able to barely afford one of my large pizzas but on a busy night i can make a pizza a minute that s sixty pizzas in an hour christ help me
that s right that makes no sense
i think the same thing with fast food workers let s get real here on average one mcdonald s ticket totals to more than the worker makes in a hour
hey it s just like that marx and engels dudes said
i lost count of how many ret ar ded capitalist bootlicking pigs i saw in this thread over dozen dotards insulting the creator as well as the poster of this infomercial this sub has gone to shit
i work in nonprofit fundraising and i regularly help organize distributions of like tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars occasionally even millions and it s like wow look at all that money some of it is going to important programs our nonprofit does and some of it is going to the union busting lawyers we faced in bargaining for a fucking year and a half or our ceo s nearly 1m yr salary
cogs has entered the room
i am sure he can steal a few a day if he wanted to
was once making manifolds in a machine shop with lots of manufacturing time on every expensive machines any tiny little impact could render a part worthless the supervisor thought it d be positive and helpful to tell everyone one of these is worth more than you make in a week if another one gets dinged no more earbuds allowed during work
murica moment
yeah but you didn t design them pay for the machines lease the building pack ship advertise or sell them all that stolen profit covers all that and more that s also the reason you are able to make so many in an hour if you had to do all that i think your actual productivity would be minimal
today it really clicked how much value is just taken away from my work like wtf
this an example of not being the guy to take on the risk whoever funded the company took risk on and could ended up in the shitter with massive debt this dude has zero risk of that happening to him and can only profit from the success of the guy who took the risk to make the company
either you stop buying or people who work there stop making them and strike
to me they look like the detachable eye cradle of a dslr camera
the original thread for this op said they were clutch dampers for motorcycles one clutch needs multiple of these for the repair
yes what is these
widgets
i thought kinky cock ring but i would think that
looks like a cock ring to me
i mean producing is one thing you still have to source it ship it package it sell it and pay all the labor in between
the original post mentioned it was part of a motorcycle i think the clutch for a honda model iirc
also the posters never seem to understand that the guy pushing a button on a machine is not adding of the value
goods services what does it matter what the item is the sentiment is what s important
me on minimum wage not thriving not living not happy just minimum because they can t pay me less couldn t possibly agree with you more should have gotten a better education and found a better job but i like being an ambulance officer fml
they saw a meme and expected everyone write them an economics textbook to explain it
i can only afford 3x per hour means nothing at all for all you know the cost of the parts could be material there are problems with capitalism but x y means jack shit if you don t know the values for either
they are getting more than already the taxes paid that eventually go to you later in life other benefits as well they likely get about 500th to 700th of what is produced considering the other costs that don t really go to any one person utilities machines maintenance building insurance and more the profit margin probably isn t anywhere close to what the meme implies
you only can i did p
same i ve shipped a single item before that was more than week s pay took me like minutes to go grab and i still had to do things c
clutch damper
daddy chill
capitalism will also argue and the owners of that company shouldn t have to pay any taxes
publically traded companies are required to make all financial info public you can take a look at the k and or q of some companies in the sp500 to get an idea of how much profit companies are making compared to total revenue
and if that s the retail cost then you know they probably only pay half that when stocking them for sale
i ironically have no idea
the value to pay ratio from the pic is like how is that not an argument for better pay
it s a great example if their ratio of labor to cost is so low raising their pay should not account for any difference in price no one is denying that there s an entire extraction production process involved
if that guy is truly making second they are not doing it by hand its slightly less than per minute likely some massively expensive machines involved to do that and the guy making them is pretty skilled to operate those machines there is probably a ton of work to setup and take down to actually create them and who knows if this is the guy s full time job or it s just a once a month job to fulfill a company s request
imagine if the building materials etc were crowdsourced through a transparent elected agency essentially a powerful union and the profits were put back into society directly rather than into a billionaire s bank to be used to gain further profits rinse repeat that d be pretty cool
the argument would be the profit margin i imagine the margin does actually offer room for better pay
it s the disparity that s in question here dumbass
exactly i get the sentiment but some of these post just undermine the people on this sub and make us look stupid
the building materials etc are all useless without the workers tho clown harder
who created the steaks
not really once the initial costs are made and paid off it is all profit there is a small that goes to management but its not much compared to the profits and a small of those profits are used to offset short term losses for new products to keep profits steady
all we do here is fire in all directions it s counter productive but we don t care it s cathartic
exactly i get the point the post is trying to make there s a disparity between production and worker earnings but he didn t harvest he raw materials for the plastic and he s not the only one that works in the factory if there s employees at the factory the disparity is now
guy that puts the wheels on cars standing in front of a billion dollar car factory i can make cars a day why don t i get paid cars a day
that s what i thought but they don t look like my canon eyecup anyways i can get a packs total of the ones i use for edit i guess my point is i need context wtf are those
definitely not in any bike clutch i ve ever pulled apart there s a cush drive rubber bit inside the rear wheel sprocket assembly but it doesn t look like this however not all bikes are the same
they are those
yeah they cheap out on that shit too
buy it use it break it fix it trash it change it mail upgrade it charge it point it zoom it press it snap it work it quick erase it write it cut it paste it save it load it check it quick rewrite it plug it play it burn it rip it rip it
not to mention the buildings and equipment that goes into each of these steps and the labor required to build them plus the labor required to source ship package and sell the parts required to build the buildings and equipment in the first place
his videos are spot on and depressing
i m laughing but it s the i m dead inside laugh
if i could suddenly afford a house just because it was haunted i d be making friends with those ghosts in no time
i ve been saving money for the last years i signed for a build months ago and thought i was finally guna have my own place for those months i put away every spare dollar i had completely abandoned my hobbies turned down holiday and sporting competitions cut down on everything i enjoyed because i was worried i was guna get fucked over by interest rates well i found out not long ago that the builder had abandoned the project and run off with the money the developers are lawyering up against him whilst tryna find another builder to take on the project problem is because all the materials have been left out in the rain for over months they have to get discarded everything has to start again i ve been told they ve found a new builder but it might incur an increased cost my broker tells me that i m already maxed out on my borrowing capacity i might lose my only chance of owning my own house i ve done everything right in my life i saved money i ve stayed out of debt i have no dependents it s just me working full time and putting in as much overtime as i m allowed i don t spend money i don t go out it s great hearing that my best isn t good enough fuck the banks fuck the housing market fuck this entire godawful existence
today s 1st time homebuyers are screwed i feel for them i bought my first house with my then wife years ago cost while our combined annual incomes were between interest rates were in the range and we barely qualified but we did qualify after divorcing and moving to a new city my 2nd place cost 120k while i was making around 40k myself i qualified through some sort of special financing interest rate after years i sold for 198k and had enough cash to buy a small condo outright cheap piece of crap that cost only 60k but owned outright good for me when initially purchases any of the was within rang of a new home buyer maybe with a financial shoe horn but they could own their own place now that 2nd place would sell for over 300k just years after i sold it the cheap pos i bought for 60k now they are going for over 200k only years later i cannot imaging making 60k to qualify for a loan for one of these only to realize you are in what is effectively an apartment for years fwiw another 20k in improvements and the place is nice and livable for one person maybe even add a kid no way
if you re not anti capitalist at this point then you re either naive or rich
you forgot the part where if you manage to scrape enough together and are dumb enough to get screwed over by the real estate agent and just barely manage to get into a house an hour and a half from where you work to the detriment of your only personal vehicle the price of your fixed rate mortgage will suddenly go up a month a year later leaving you wondering why no one told you this was going to happen and now here i am thinking i m back to barely scraping by if i make it what wonders will next year hold only dreams can know
if it makes you feel better blackrock investments just had their hq attacked and raided by protestors in paris so that s something
o boy i can t wait to fill my kitchen cupboards with air because i spent all my food money on a down payment on a house i can t afford
i am not a anti work typical i disagree with a lot of what is said here but numbers and financial realities do hit home with me i am pretty conservative on most things but i would vote for damn near any political party that would push out private equity and pull landlording back on private homes the loan rates they are getting on hundreds of millions to buy houses are 3rd of what anyone else could get and they benefit from paying cash and removing 10k or so of closing costs per house by not getting individual loans for each house too obviously there s value for some rental properties for short term living it makes me so sad that people are pushed out of home ownership private equities buying up huge swaths or in some occasions whole neighborhoods being built to rent out and eventually take over almost all housing scares the shit out of me i know the home i own i basically lucked into i bought in at the low very early in my 20s my cousins in their early 20s could be making more than i did and still not be able to buy the house i did years earlier unlike a lot of people i don t want to pull the ladder up with me
i love the cash cow part the most
i love how i was just talking about this today i m pretty much waiting for some kind of collapse in the market
you all get the invitation homes ad in the middle there
we were able to get an fha loan to buy our house the down payment was pretty reasonable to get the pan the house just has to pass inspection we got a house that wasn t very modernized and the requirements after inspection were doable edit for people too ornery to consider this i m not bragging about home ownership i m letting people know about a possible option for financing that they may not know about
let me tell you a hack save every dollar you get for a couple years then move to south america where dollar is worth way more and women are
needing to live in a luxurious place is his problem though property gets exponentially more expensive in places where a lot of people want to be it s not crazy that you have to prioritize between the home ownership economic game or the expensive metro high wage job economic game the economics of the house as your nest egg are fucked they provide a perverse incentive against high density urban development from homeowners altogether similar to this guy just a little more lucky once they own they take political action to make it harder for others to join them for the sake of raising their property values if you want to own a house go somewhere they are cheap if you want to live somewhere that houses are crazy expensive fight politically to get more dense housing built
lowering standards really helps when buying a home it s possible you re standards just need to be really low edit getting downvoted but it s true and it s just a starter home people want their dream home off the bat but it s truly a struggle move out of the city and big towns move roommates in do anything to get you there if you want it
honestly people s standards are too high look at the size of houses built post ww2 they were much smaller you also need to be willing to be handy these are the same people who will go lease an expensive car and take it to a dealership to get repaired yes houses are expensive but people are whiny bi es look at how the rest of the world lives with generations deep to a household
we bought out first home a few years back 160k home 4k down interest rate all this doom and gloom is tiresome people act like they should be able to buy a 400k home on a minimum wage salary
it looked sarcastic and i wouldn t be surprised if a realtor sponsored it
on pointe
hey i have a wonderful opportunity for you just kidding we can t afford it
lol my entire future is riding on risky investments it s my only shot proceeds to double down on gamestop stocks
his message is absolutely correct also his poses are spot on
my retirement plan is to eventually chase my last quarter out into traffic
ouch felt this
blackstone blackrock is a completely different company
when american dream turns into only some people s dream but dont worry rest of the world follows wonder how bad it will get
amazing perfect thank you really really sad hilarious
this guy is funny i like his style

sad but true
who is this any links
truth yeah depressing af
i felt a flicker of light with some of the laughs it s dark out here y all
big mood
ya know battery powered bluetooth speakers and smart color changing led are surprisingly affordable these days
i always have said just be nice to the ghosts and they ll be chill with you
i ve done everything right in my life did you try being born in
or grew up in a socialist country and fled that country because conditions were so poor
you can support capitilism and be anti greed capitilism isn t the problem greed is
sounds like your taxes went up call your mortgage company and ask for a year to date statement and an explanation of the increase you can challenge a tax increase you ll probably need to get an appeals form from your county s office
comments yeah great but blackstone are the goons buying single family properties blackrock is a completely different financial company with a different set of issues you can feel free to take issue with
thanks for your comments you know capitalism has gotten bad when even anti anti work people agree with us i wish other people in my life who speak about how amazing reagan and trickle down economics is working cold just take a minute and see that no one under who hasn t bought yet will ever own a home in our lifetime and it s sad i hope home ownership happens for me but i don t see how that s a realistic dream for anyone anymore even with a college degree and a decent job one income just isn t enough to afford a house anywhere near any city where jobs are
exactly and that s due to government sponsored inflation and bad monetary policy on the part the fed those only benefit the elite and politicians see this link for some truth who benefits from inflation and fed policies https://youtu.be/gu0eqm01vu0)
i loved the backwards turn around booty angle too funny
you must live in the boonies
congrats you are a debt slave renting a home from a bank
his luxuries are jobs and stuff to do not actual luxury as you perceive it if i m buying a home i can actually afford aka not living off a credit card like realtors suggest then i have to move miles away i already live miles away from work
people usually want to buy a house close to where they work not move to nebraska just so they can afford a home and not have a job
the only reason we got our house after so many failed offers was because of a blocked sewage pipe broken furnace and a number of other issue with the year old house but we are slowly repairing everything and we are just thankful to have a house
buy cheap and be handy
i don t like the good bad framing but i agree that late 20th century housing expectations and therefore early 21st century housing stock are way too big for the number of residents they house major city metro obviously where he is needs to get super expensive because they won t politically allow for higher density he s fucked because the suburbs in the market for a suburban house
i mean on the flip side look at the cost of a studio apartment in nyc that is straight theft utter and complete madness
a few years back good job could you afford your house at its current value and interest rate if you had no equity don t worry i know the answer is you couldn t
put your money where your mouth is and sell me your home for 160k i have my realtor ready for the paperwork
i just want a livable house with a backyard in a decent school district that is cheap enough to afford groceries as well as the mortgage payment apparently that s too much to ask for
tomfell on instagram he s fucking hilarious
that s where i went wrong
capitalism rewards greed handsomely
oh honey
my escrow went negative because they didn t account for insurance so when they paid my home insurance my escrow account went negative taxes did go up but not by much i believe the mortgage broker is at fault for this and im fairly certain there is no way out of it other than a slug fest for the next year
nope first ring suburb
and you never needed a loan because your parents paid for your house
no they aren t renting anything stop being obtuse
it s hard to talk about this stuff without getting into details while cities have more higher paying jobs those jobs also attract people who take their extra money and buy up all of the housing for people in most lines of work there is a way to make some nominal move say miles to a more affordable area with a job lined up i m not disagreeing with some policies to help housing but make it cheap for this guy to buy a single family home is the development pattern the us has been following since wwii and half of the problems we have with housing are our over reliance on low density housing near urban cores quite frankly your job pays you just enough to get you to show up and the only way to raise the wage is for people to refuse the work solidly of americans find themselves in this grind to keep just above water situation it s clearly a problem but we can t give this man a house our way out of it obviously there are jobs in nebraska but the culture and entertainment aren t as celebrated maybe there s a better life for you in ne for all you know it sounds like you don t even want to be where you are you just think rural areas are beneath you
agreed i am a commercial gc in denver projects i m bidding on are getting crazy i priced an apartment job where the units are 375sf the bed is literally in the kitchen between that and denver s new mandatory affordable housing requirements of all units in a new developement people will either have to accept the smaller units or move away from the metro
nyc is routinely at the top of the list for one of most expensive cities in the world
rookie mistake
you can support christianity and be anti jesus
so does greed
man those auto generated recruiting emails are so fucking skeevy
it will pay lower than the smaller number
indeed has tools that allow employers to send invitation emails to any candidate that matches their search criteria they can also customize those invitation emails to make them sound personalized in order to get a better response to over simplify things let s pretend an employer wants to hire a baker but specifically needs someone who specializes in cupcakes with a preference for buttercream frosting indeed will automate the search process and send a dear chef your buttercream cupcakes are amazing please come work with us email to people who qualify then indeed will take the people who respond and sell those applications to the hiring company automating the recruitment process that email typically doesn t come from a person it s a search engine and you match the algorithm yes there are smaller companies that care and actually read resumes before inviting applicants but it s rare and time consuming
oh hun they say that for everyone they don t read resumes
be very careful with jobs posted on indeed there are so many inconsistencies that it is impossible to get a clear job description from them between stupid pay scales as you described to listing set hours in one place then totally different ones elsewhere when possible i try to avoid the site
turns out linkedin is just full of useless recruitment agencies
so this is indeed s robot not the actual agency you re talking to it s stupid i ve had indeed tell me i m a good fit for jobs i m nowhere qualified for lmao
that s a typo should be ai came across your resume
looks to be a scam to me i get tons of emails just like this for nothing i ever applied for and usually out of my field
lol they invite people to apply to that job every hour
the number you will get is the lowest number listed
you just gotta do that thing where you say i ll do quality of work or i ll do your choice
i was once given a range of 180k
translation we want a 70k employee for 33k
when they offer you between 30k 70k that s code for 30k approach with caution lol
probably a sales job
eh for your 2nd line i would have said something like are you lying or stupid but that s why i m not on indeed i guess
the pay is d o e depending on ethnicity
the recruitment version of who is this when they rang you
recruiters are like marketers consultants and single family home landlords needless middlemen get out of the fuckin way
any job listing with a salary range has no range it will always be the lowest value
so many scammers on indeed
recruiters hate being called out this is a dead end
salary ranges are probably pretty broad for a position imagine getting hired at the 33k and after a few years you max out at the 71k but that probably isn t going to be the starting salary range which is more important
based on the job title this is probably a sales position based off commission of some kind it s not uncommon to see 30k to 150k for jobs like this
recruiters belong in the same circle of hell as real estate agents for this reason full of shit
depends on your skill level for the job you were a dick to this hr person
yes i see your resume here but you didn t finish putting everything from your resume into our website so therefore we don t see it
shotgun recruiting emails for scraps of commission i d almost feel bad for them if they weren t perpetuating the problem
recruiters really be out there phoning it in and expect to get top tier candidates for shit pay we truly live in a time
opportunity for growth
i ve come to the conclusion that recruiters on linkedin are brain dead
reads like a scam to me they re wildly rampant on job hunting sites these days
to be fair you re replying to a spam bot
i ve seen worse saw one with a 100k spread just this week
i swear whenever i get one of these auto generated recruiting emails it s for a hr job requiring a master s degree and years of work experience maybe fix your sh tty automation tools and figure out how to afford to pay a competitive salary in the meantime
i get these messages on indeed alot i believe these are automated somehow based on certain criteria
times those messages are auto generated most times they ll just pick the job at the top of your resume to say that makes you a good fit for their job i ve gotten ones that say we think your experience as a dishwasher would make you a good fit for our reception role
sounds like a sales job probably varies wildly due to commission most sales gigs have tried to come up with cute titles not sure why account manager business development something or other customer success manager etc etc most of the time they just mean sales
whenever there is a range there is a fairly high chance it is always the lower number
having a broad salary such as this is not allowed on indeed and when this comes to attention of people who deal with job postings and it will this job posting will be taken down source i worked at indeed
about years ago i had one reach out and oddly enough they had a copy of my resume but it was years old i was also no longer working in that industry and by then my salary had nearly tripled in what they were offering
as many people have stated already these types of canned messages are automated my personal tip as someone who has used indeed monster and dozens of job search sites simple use them as job discovery sites you see an interesting company that is hiring simply disregard any information posted and go directly to their website do not use their auto fill resume function always go directly to the company s main website to apply there and upload your own resume there
i live in wa where employers are required by law to post pay ranges my previous employer posts the job as 50k 100k punchline no one gets close to 100k the highest salary they ve ever started someone at in that job is 70k
salary range all rational numbers
lol i want to see the follow up i know they re feeling real stupid
you think you re better than me because you can read huh huh
depending on how much value you may bring to the organization they may pay you more or less
i simply cannot get my head far enough up my ass to become a recruiter that guy tho wow
the best part is that it s super easy to send a personalized email to a candidate and then not be clueless when they reply back automation is easy source was a recruiter didn t do dumb shit like that
after interviews across weeks
yes but they ll do a review in six months so there s a possibility of a raise at that point
dude thank you so much for this reply i literally started job searching on indeed a couple days ago and i was wondering if these indeed emails were automated or personal invites
if a person puts in the effort to explain why they think i m a good fit and usually the job is a reasonable fit then i ll respond with a polite explanation why i m not interested the generic messages are ignored or blocked that being said i recently was sent a posting that was 100k 200k that s quite the range
wow that s some shit i ve never used indeed and i certainly won t now
yeah that seems to be an automated message based on relatability to the job i think
ay they have software that automatically combs your profile for keywords and develops a list of prospects that is given to the recruiters industrialized talent acquisition
lemme hear your alternatives i too hate indeed
yep listing jobs as remote goto the companies website and it is not remote at all
shotgun approach if you talk to companies and interview at you should be able to land something decent i m at an alright place right now thru indeed
indeed is not linkedin
me ok 180k sounds reasonable
everyone is being screwed it s not a race thing anymore
easy solution always ask for the max and refuse to compromise if everybody does this and nobody is willing to accept anything lower than the maximum the position stays vacant until they re more honest about how much they re willing to pay even when they adjust down refuse to budge from the maximum you re willing to pay up to this much so i want that much i won t budge this especially if they re the ones reaching out to you even if it s an automated message
nope they belong with the used car salesmen 7th circle working on 8th
hmm i thought putting my resume into your data base was your job
i ve got a growth opportunity for them right here
and you have to quit your current job before you can interview here so we know you re serious
still room for improvement
i actually dropped indeed because it became apparent it s focused on the employers and not the employees it s a talent seeking site for employers not a job seeking site for prospective employees you can actually tell in most of their advertising too it s geared toward recruiting people not finding a job or career
doesn t help they re not even set up for job seekers it s a business model than can t work long term
we need our own bots to fill out the applications and answer the questions till you get a live human being on the other end only fair
it s funny because this software does such a terrible job matching people to jobs i always get shown jobs that have nothing to do with what i currently do if you re going to invest so much money in not having to do any work as a recruiter at least make sure your solution sorta works lol
every recruiter that has tried to do this to me has always gotten the same question how much are you paying oh that depends on experience you literally contacted me based off my resume you have all the information you need right there
yea but shouldn t they be able to see the message history to reference what job was named
i use ziprecruiter and linkein i ve gotten jobs through both the easy quick apply buttons are fantastic downside with linkedin you can t really search by location easily but it s also good for networking honestly if they don t bother to have an easy application process i move on cause they clearly don t care enough and if i am giving you my resume don t make me fill out the online version that s just gonna make me close the tab
research companies you think you might want to work for go directly to their website
the listings that say remote and then the first line of the description is this job is on site in seattle washington and i m over here like the why the fuck did you advertise it in new jersey
because in linkedin when searching for entry level jobs they will bombard your search results with anything but
i agree with the first part of your sentence
it is still a race thing and literally everyone is being financially raped
so we know you re serious desperate
and then say that you re not a good fit for the company
soon my friend soon with chat gpt anything is possible
i ve been reached out to by recruiters for jobs that i don t even have a single of the required qualifications for not one they re not even the kinds of qualifications that you can ignore for the position i m willing to learn on the job but i guarantee i m not what they re looking for
hm any tips on discovering companies i might want to work for
i got hit with this for a job in wisconsin it was listed as in nyc on linkedin it was one of the few apps that i actually got a call back of course i m not going to move to wisconsin so it was a waste of time i told them what happened and they said they apparently post the job in all markets and that it s an issue with how the site displays them and they are working to fix it i still see jobs posted for them in my area and many others except wisconsin so i guess they never figured it out
indeed is even worse than linkedin
exactly it makes no sense at this point we are our own recruiters honestly yet another job to be taking on
look at the occupation field you re interested in working in figure out the industries that hire in that field find the most popular companies in that industry in your area or just in general and apply to those i m graduating from college soon and am looking for a data analyst position and looked up the most popular industries for that position
maybe personally i ve never gotten a job through linkedin only indeed and i apply through linkedin much more frequently because everyone says it s better
ah okay that s fairly actionable advice thanks
i got one through linkedin two offers after my first weeks applying and an army of recruiters who loved my resume but couldn t materialize an interview let alone an offer to save their life
i ve actually gotten two through linkedin not a single call from any indeed applications well one several months after i got a position and nearly a year after i had applied
so fucked up i hate how they have so much power over us all it feels like the united states of corporations
and if you ever complain at all they tell you to leave like leaving the country is the easiest thing in the world
we can get rid of them by just not giving them our labour value money rent strikes
fuck capitalism
shouldn t the landlord be the wolf and the cop the pig
that s just scalping with extra steps
it s pretty much impossible especially if you live alone it s a joke
our parents did this to us now watch as our votes are ignored and systems used against us
that would be because it is
sounds nice on paper but is everyone just going to go homeless or do you mean more of in the sense of they can t evict us all
not if it was intended to be a reference to animal farm
don t vote for a party vote independent they are not winning this time but if independent gets a more people will start voting independent and when it gets to politicians will know they have to either try harder or join independent parties to keep it going and eventually you will get better politicians that are not owned by corporations i mean corruption by lobbying is legal in the us how the hell that happened
and throw away my vote and let the gop stack more judges nah
i used to say the same thing but unfortunately that isn t the move anymore look at what is happening in tn republicans don t care anymore they re pushing a fascist regime and the only way to combat it is to vote blue in the mean time
fuck that one party is at least trying to run the place and keep things stable the other is trying to take us back years before women could even vote vote dem destroy the republicans then we can prop up an independent to go against the democrats
lmao this is literally the logic that got trump elected
lol this idiotic mindset leaves you in this trap democrats are not your friends either bud
well both parties are after you and neither is trying to help you so you just fell into their game and are not voting for them but agains the other and well keep playing i m sure they will get bored of getting money handed to them and will change their ways eventually
yeah lol wouldn t it be funny if he was president lol troll vote lol oh fuck women don t have human rights anymore
if you were to rank in terribleness what would you rank republicans vs democrats yeah dude democrats don t line up with my beliefs at all tbh but the alternative is straight up tyranny
well one is explicitly trying to remove me and my friends from existence and the other isn t
r enlightenedcentrism
they re both capitalistic dogs who will sell out their voters for the wealthy the only difference between them is the lies and frivious bullshit they tell you to get their vote make no mistake they each have a sole alliance to the almighty dollar and nothing else
awwwn you think someone is out to get you and your friends explain to me what you think it s happening and how they are helping you
can you present a contemporary difference that is in the news that you view as frivolous

i assume they re some variety of lgbt
nazis i m so tired of people saying we have it out for them also nazis literally working to kick out all poc lawmakers
get out of here with that both sides bs you have seen the bs the far right is doing as much as the left is screwing us at least they are not setting us back i would rather vote in a slow forward progression than let the shit bad push us back
the fact that you think the news would ever report on this is hilarious they re funded by the exact same companies and political parties you want to see the real state of america go listen to jimmy dore or breaking points real independent journalists
democrats aren t left
could you name any differences at all between the two partys
if i were to find out jimmy dore had bee suffering from a slow growing brain tumor and he took back a large portion of the nutty shit he s said i wouldn t be surprised in the least not voting to protect vulnerable people now is giving up and letting the bad guys win
compared to our options it is the most left we are gonna get until the boomers die out
this needs to be made into an international trend would love hearing and seeing it in all the worlds languages locales and distractions
employers have gotten to where they think they own us and our labor this needs to be the norm don t want to work this day fuck it

we also have a generally easier work environment when it comes to taking days off this guy is probably just using either his weeks sick leave or weeks of holiday leave both of which we are encouraged to take i generally take at least a day off once a month just to handle my stress levels a monday or friday is good if you re smart you line up some days off with public holidays when days leave can give you a day break like this week
chucking a sickie is one of the most important phrases in the aussie vernacular
this child labour push is happening the same time as the defund delay pension push it looks like the wealthy have decided we will work from childhood to death at least the billionaires will benefit
i m not familiar with this bill but i do work in restaurants i started as a dishwasher at i sucked i was lazy and unreliable i didn t develop any sense of responsibility until i was and supporting myself most year olds are not going to be much of an asset to any workplace this is just pure desperation thise kids should be focusing on school and figuring out who they are restaurants are in a bad spot young people aren t going into cooking and those of us who have been doing it for a long time are dying there are not enough people entering the career to sustain the amount of restaurants that exist and that s fine there are too many restaurants running poorly and offering garbage product forcing children into the job pool at a younger age will not solve any problems
you know france is in flames right now for just adding a couple of years to the pension trash is being dumped on politicians yards effigies alight chanting and protests in the streets noncompliance to the letter corporate entities are having their windows smashed in etc we could learn a lot from france
i just i know that there are some parents who might try to force their kids to work but this is like kids can organize online and if you try to force a minor child to hold a job you re putting yourself squarely in cps s sights it would have to be voluntary and year olds aren t going to go work in a fucking meat packing plant because republicans legalized it not in where they can discuss this shit on r teenagers and then get linked to r antiwork and start trying to form unions the second they arrive at any job they take like how out of touch do you have to be to think that legalizing child labor is actually going to work in this day and age do you not realize the teens today are more politically informed today than adults were in the year why the fuck do you think its young millenials and fucking gen z who are organizing unions the year olds you want to employ are part of the generation driving the unionization of the american work force you morons
im surprised roomba hasn t made a commercial grade factory cleaner like that would be better in the long term for all parties involved but old people and their old ideas keep getting in the way
because restraunt owners can only earn a profit if they pay their employees shit wages that s where their profits come from is underpaying their employees because historically they are still stuck in a time where the primary age group looking for work in restraunts were young adults that is no longer the status quo
simply put they want this because older people dont want to work for dogshit wages if youre here saying theres plenty of jobs available at how fucking dense can you be they are not promoting independence or responsibility from a young age theyre encouraging a servitude to them before youre able to even drive why leave the good paying job ive had from and go to school when i can just stay here and make my money wake up you weird fucks literally have never in my life seen a child say damn wish i could get a job at the factory already its all i ever wanted this is inspired by greed
of course they love employing vulnerable people who don t fully understand corporate ethics or labor laws they re super easy to manipulate and exploit
kids don t need to work in fucking meat packing plants filthy ass fat fucking bastards dreamed this 19th century nightmare up
well little timmy is gonna have to pay his child support for little suzie s forced birth baby somehow
this guy watched those kids cooking shows and wants to hire them cheap to cook pay them in xbox psn bucks
and next it will be child porn
this guy also led the floor debate leading up to the vote that stripped almost all bargaining power from public sector unions in iowa in making it illegal to bargain basically anything but base wages he did that with the same shit eating grin you see in this photo he is not the sharpest tool in the shed but he is a self righteous tool
remember we allow these politicians to make rules that will affect our families for years to come good luck to the next generation things just keep getting more fuck up money greed
i had a older guy come in asking if his year old grandson could apply one time
yeah he looks like a guy who likes kids a lot fcking creep
ahh straight out of the ole alec playbook
don t doubt for a moment that all of these shitheels would love to own plantations and people again
we socialists and social democrats are proud to announce that the gop is morally bankrupt and legally corrupt we will see those fuckers in court progressives assemble
am i the only one suspecting this is the gop s secure the borders obsession biting them in the ass as massively inadequate as it is minimum wage jobs would be a boon to folks from central america trying to support their family
well the lobbyists aren t going to send their own kids to the coal mines remember we aren t involved in a war right now so they need more money
kids in meatpacking and construction parents in sweatshops blame universities for when you get blown out in elections cry about being discriminated against when nobody throws you a parade and gives you a medal for being a piece of garbage like fuckface rittenhouse rinse and repeat
hey now the younger generation can start saving to move for more opportunity sooner
as an employer i think this is an important step towards our ultimate goal to bring slavery back
these lobbyists literally write laws then hand them off to their bought politicians to implement and you think giving this corrupt gov more control and power over things like healthcare is the solution jfc
yes because teaching children it is cool to murder animals is exactly what will help this country
i started working doing roofing at best thing that ever happened to me and crucial part of me growing up and becoming a successful adult
restaurant groups pushing this makes sense i don t see a problem with a washing dishes if they want to
every single time
i just keep my mind on the end game the end game is the evil people die doing evil thinking they will get away with it but there is not a valley of evil or shadow of death for them to hide in they will be awaken judged and cast into a burning and bottomless pit a true one sided victory for yah
noo
oh my fucking god we are so god damned fucked
they re allowed to work at cool
corporations making laws now hmm well the usa is no longer run by politicians but by corporations
listen as someone who was formerly please god dont let them work not only are their minds underdeveloped but they should be enjoying life and the lessons it can teach such as not being a dumbass i remember that when i was i was building some lego and got stuck on one part for almost hours the instructions said to insert this stick into a specific socket but the stick was too long so after hours i found a very sharp knife and cut it in half only to find the stick i was supposed to use inches away on the same table as the large pile of legos as the saying goes r kidsarefuckingstupid
how on earth does one sleep at night lobbying government to reciprocate these atrocities of human development it is all truly sickening
most states have allowed kids to work at since i was a kid this isn t really new i grew up in washington state in the s early s and minors working wasn t an issue then it s not always the parents forcing the kids to work
they saturated the food industry with franchises why do we need a chick fil a kfc slim chickens and raising canes all within yards of each other and then wonder why they can t staff their restaurant it s because they spread out the labor pool way too much due to greed and franchise fast food and they are too fucking stupid to realize it
republicans are acting like this is meant for the go getter high schooler who just wants to beef up their resume while making some extra side cash they still pretend we re all living this optimal americana lifestyle reality is that this bill will allow shitty parents to exploit their kids for money even younger than they previously were able to and denying safetynets to kids as young as because they re actively employed republicans are straigh up immoral and don t care anymore if you know
the owner of the restaurant wanted me to hire his friends kid to be a dishwasher as a favour i told him to have the kid come in to see me next day owner comes in with his friend and the kid dad does all the talking kid appears completely disinterested in the whole thing the kid didn t get hired
this whole thing has made me very curious i started work at washing out the back of pig trucks was that illegal state in question would have been ohio i also worked in a slaughterhouse when i was
i work in a theatre that is part of a casino i work right next to the cooks servers bartenders and the like when the party calls for it the restaurant industry sucks i have never seen any business that chews people up and spits them faster
the point is to groom and traffick them
forcing children into the job pool at a younger age will not solve any problems the problem these bills are trying to solve is that a bunch of big companies got caught breaking child labor laws already and are using their bought and paid for politicians to retroactively absolve them of their crimes
i worked in restaurants as well as a few other jobs from i was an arrogant little dickhead but i was a good worker i don t see a problem with kids working if they want to really don t understand all the fuss on this one
americans seem to be too busy justifying the value of hard work and independence to care that protestant work ethic has rotted your nation s soul
their target for this legislation is not white middle class kids with access to phones and reddit this push in legislation is to allow corporations to exploit undocumented kids recent bills are relaxing visa or citizenship requirements for working kids who don t have family looking out for them and have no other way of supporting themselves because the social safety net doesn t exist in this country https://www.epi.org/publication/child-labor-laws-under-attack/ https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/immigration-migrant-child-labor-biden-administration/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/us/unaccompanied-migrant-child-workers-exploitation.html
fucking priceless comment
isn t roofing one of the most lethal jobs in america
thank you for that n evidence that child labor isn t a massive abuse
same
it s amazing that children are responsible enough to work a job but are simultaneously not mature enough or able to to drink a beer drive a car enter into a legal agreement join the military have sex use tobacco products etc etc etc but you can have a jerb
i was washing dishes in a restaurant and a retirement home after school legal in ohio when i turned jobs to save money to buy a car still kept my grades up and everything
we can already work certain jobs at in iowa this is just opening it up to potentially dangerous jobs that kids shouldn t be doing
definitely not in a meatpacking plant maybe as a cashier on a limited hour basis like a max of hours a day and days a week
here is my cents often times those children underpaid which can be allowed by law if someone at gets hired with no experiences then year old gets hires to work with no experience both do the same exact same job then the year old and the year should have the same starting pay this out of times is not the case
how do those boots taste
yeah mowing their neighbor s lawn shoveling their sidewalk once in a while for back then not working a fucking packing plant during an overnight shift
not to mention there are a lot of restaurant owners who do not understand the basic economics of running a restaurant it only worked because workers accepted poverty wages now that the average age of employees is up you don t have people willing to work for entry level wages delivery services and the pandemic forced a long overdue adjustment to restaurants about half of the restaurants today will be closed in another years
it never occurred to me until i read this that the raising canes in my neighborhood opened up a few blocks from popeyes suddenclarity png
you need them because you can have them they don t exist in that density in countries with strong labor laws and unions because labor ends up being too expensive to run them
don t forget popeye s
every major political party is immoral if they have power they are going to do their dammdest to stay in power and fatten their wallets
did you feel like it hurt you in the grand scheme interested in different perspectives on this
keyword want most of the kids already being forced to work illegally are doing it under duress but you do you bootlick
ok thank you for that information outrage refreshed i cannot fucking believe that the anti immigrant party is doing this i dislike the democratic party but fuck i wanna euthanize all the republicans
yeah not sure what all that really has to do with it but as a kid who wanted to work at i think it s important to look at both sides being able to work gave me the ability to play sports and to buy things my family wouldn t have been able to afford not allowing kids to work isn t going to make their parents any richer so they re still stuck in poverty
i m genuinely interested in if you feel like that helped or hurt you my experience wasn t ideal but it also has provided me so many opportunities i m thankful for it i d be ignorant if i didn t consider others perspectives who went through something similar though
not saying it should go entirely unchecked but what jobs a kid can do is primarily the responsibility of the parents i don t want people who clearly lack an understanding of the entirety of the situation dictating what they can and can t do at i had a job where i routinely ran a chain saw i was more than capable of doing that at but given the examples provided i wouldn t have been able to do that
i think we re taking the most extreme example and running with it i m sure there s completely reasonable things for a year old to do at a meatpacking plant the important piece is oversight and making sure they aren t put in dangerous positions which is partially the parents responsibility most states iowa and arkansas included limit the amount of hours anyone under can work so that s already in place
i don t think i disagree with anybody on this sub about wages being too low that s a completely different issue in my opinion i d say the same thing about working conditions nobody should be in a position where their job could severely injure or kill then children and adults alike
not if they can employ year olds at an hour why do you think these bills exist
that and supply chains are expensive to run across the atlantic or pacific how would jack in the box get any of their proprietary food items across the atlantic sitting in customs going moldy they would have to source entirely new suppliers for the entire menu top to bottom that and there isn t much of a drive thru culture anywhere else in the world however they have managed to do it in the uk with mcdonalds subway pizza hut guys dominos papa johns and chipotle mcdonalds is the only one that operates a drive thru in the uk there s no union presence in any of those stores to speak of heck nobody in the labour party is in a real actual trades union
and bojangles
stay in power to fatten your wallet is unethical stay in power fatten your wallet and threaten our human rights is immoral there s a big big difference this centrist they re all bad bullshit needs to stop i ll vote for a politician who s taking money on the side while doing good things any day over one who s actively working on taking away our rights
yes going to work that young really messed with my mindset i put up with worse behavior from superiors to keep from rocking the boat and i don t quit jobs i should i also experienced a few near misses physically i forgot to unplug a machine once before moving it away from the wall ended up ripping the cord out of it my dumbass was about to pick it up while it was still plugged in before someone stopped me i shaved off the tip of my finger when slicing meat once luckily i didn t hit the bone and most of it grew back a lift failed and a heavy saw came down on a guy standing feet from me would have killed him if it hit square
for perspective i delivered hay and cleaned horse stalls a few days a week during summer and once a week or so during winter starting when i was it was for family friends and my parents more or less just told me that s what i was doing i found the whole experience helpful and even if i didn t enjoy it at the time remember it fondly the big difference is that the work environment was structured for teenage labor i always had someone nearby or within arms reach keeping an eye out i was extra help not essential help and i generally only worked a few hours of actual labor during the day lots of driving around what i m trying to get at here is there are manual labor jobs where young people can fit in but simply throwing a year old into an adult job with no support or oversight is not something that is going to produce good results for anyone
a don t be a coward talking anonymous shit on the internet makes you a goon and it s pathetic b stop making up data as if you have any knowledge about what is really happening most of the people i know grew up working from a young age could there be a lot of kids working in bad conditions absolutely but no law is going to make their parents not be shitty
yeah and if you separate the parents from the children and deport the parents hey new labor source that s virtually untraceable which also means when you have children inevitably dying from dangerous working conditions their deaths will be under or un reported because nobody really knows where they were in the first place and you can t file for workman s comp if you don t know your rights but also are undocumented it s fucking hideous
honestly we could gain a lot by overthrowing both political parties and lforcing them into neverending poverty
so what s the cutoff jobs for a year old coal mining mma fighting no year old can make any amount of money that would be anything of value to a family not to mention we have social safety nets so that families don t have to rely on a year old child to feed them what the fuck
oh it helped my parents were pretty strict and huge on responsibility if i wanted to date or use the car buy my own things etc i had to work to afford them i was also only allowed to use of my paychecks for fun the rest went into a savings i couldn t touch this was the late s so yeah it taught me the value of money and how to prioritize what i wanted and the value of keeping a job i learned basic adult infrastructure before i left the house using the car year old honda accord required i fill the tank wash wax and vacuum it out weekly when i turned my dad sold me his car at full kbb value by that point it had about coats of wax on it
i have lost family members who were professional loggers to chainsaws those are not the tools a yo should be making a living with yos belong in school with a summer job if they want it nobody that age should have to work i know i had to it is not a fun way to spend your childhood
boot licker comment
parents should not get to decide such things for their children just like that not surprised but still disgusted at all you child labour apologists popping up no bar too low
i risked life and limb at for the billionaires and it tasted great
yeah and when you were if you d chopped your fucking hand off your family could have sued the company and made damn sure they paid all medical plus extra for p s the new law in iowa exempts corporations from being held accountable for injuries death to children while working dangerous jobs
my children are children not workers fuck all that
these bills are literally a response to government investigations finding kids illegally working in dangerous conditions at meatpacking plants this isn t the most extreme example it is literally what is already happening and these bills are designed to retroactively absolve these companies of their crimes
those are real examples i worked on dangerous construction sites i was and saw a guy fall down story and bash his head in he fucking died fuck you for supporting child labor
yes because if we all know anything it s that meat packing plants are wonderful well maintained and full of oversight for their adult employees now substitute children in that situation fucking ridiculous take the new law in iowa rolls back many of those restrictions sounds like your privilege and luck is more responsible for your success than hard work as a child get fucking real
problem is most politicians on both sides of the aisle are fattening their wallets and threatening rights so i am not quite sure why you think the centrist viewpoint isn t valid
that s shitty sorry that was your experience
that s a great perspective i fully agree that there needs to be a lot of protections in place i also feel like the current fines for breaking the rules should be substantially higher they need to set the precedent that if you don t protect the kids and take advantage of the system it ll cost millions not a couple thousand
so here s the thing first i m not talking anonymously any more than you are bud second as someone whose parents grew up in a different time they both believed my schooling was more important than extra cash from their personal experience being work mules for their parents so take your victim complex back in the deck third these laws being overturned has been repeatedly repeatedly proven to have been in response to employers like tyson in my home state illegally hiring underage workers to work in their processing plants finally i m not apologizing for calling you a bootlick when you are actively openly and vocally arguing that child labor isn t so bad and it didn t affect me so it s okay so enjoy the rest of your night bootlicking corporations that will always look at us all as disposable resources bootlick
at i made enough to buy the things i wanted to buy i think i worked hours a week which allowed me to take my girlfriend on dates buy baseball gear and better clothes than my family could afford to buy me i wanted to work i chose to work and if you d asked me at that point i would ve politely asked you to shut up i know plenty of other kids who also did the same thing it s a reality of growing up in rural poverty if you think social safety net programs are putting families in a position to give kids a good life then you re so far removed from reality that you shouldn t be sharing an opinion on anything because you clearly don t have any understanding of what those families go through
that s my perspective too it gave me an insight into adult life and how to balance work life as well as i learned good financial habits etc
yeah logging is not a place for kids this was mostly cutting down little saplings on properties a local real estate company was trying to sell that sort of thing my grandfather was a logger so i grew up running a saw and didn t find it to be particularly dangerous at i was more equipped to operate a saw than most adults i recognize i am likely the exception to that rule though year olds should not have to work i fully agree the unfortunate part is that there are hundreds of thousands of kids who have to because of their living conditions and poverty
that person is licking the boot of big meat packing like it s the only way they re gonna get meat
yeah how dare i provide an alternate perspective and think that parents should determine what their child does over random internet trolls and politicians thanks for your feedback
a mental health day
you have an eye problem i can t see myself coming to work today
my last corporate job and i mean last i quit and have not returned to corporate work had personal days where i could just schedule a future day off with no reasoning my managers who were thankfully incredible people would just be happy to put my request in and would say things like enjoy your day get out and have fun those were small things that kept me going through it all for a while
there was one time i told my boss flat out it s supposed to be 85f tomorrow way too nice to be stuck in an office can i take the day off to go to the beach to my surprise he agreed
ohhh how i wish this would catch on
this is what i refer to as calling out sick
i like to start work early in the morning specifically because i m not a morning person i m not giving my job the best hours of my day they re getting the grumpy brain fogged morning zachbnonymous the one with coffee breath that can t pay attention to what you re saying and spends most of his day on reddit and youtube
mental health day
this is the way
call in with a vague sense of doom
i currently accumulate a little over one vacation day per month at my job but they ve also allowed me almost hours of sick pay that i can use throughout the year how about just rolling into one and not heckling me about what ailment i may or may not have
feeling under the weather too damn nice outside to waste it with you bunch of bitter miserable boomer fuck heads
as a chronically ill person i feel this
boss i m just feeling real good today so i m gonna see you tomorrow
that s why if i ever work a regular job again when i call out i will only say that i won t be in that day they don t need to know anything else
that s an illness being sick of work
you don t have an obligation to be employed somewhere if you don t want to follow their rules go somewhere else or don t work and deal with the repercussions this ain t hard
and thus the people who actually showed up end up getting burned out carrying the extra load and end up actually sick gud plan
i have done this before i even told my boss on the phone that i feel too good to go in today luckily we had a no fault policy
i usually call out on fridays when i wake up and just don t feel like going to work
i like this idea i only have one or two really healthy days per month
more like a health day as taking a day off also covers physical health
i did this when diablo came out i freaking needed that
there s a variant called anal glaucoma i can t see my ass going to work
in europe we call this a normal holiday day
i feel this so much i put in absolute minimum effort only not to get fired the rest i spend on doing jackshit once im done with all the work for the day ie watching youtube and playing video games on my pc and sleeping with my mouse jiggler in my laptop
be careful with that you could die
yeah this has been discussed where i work we re not required to offer sick leave because our pto plan offers more leave than the state s sick leave laws require so rather than have sick days and vacation days we just give pto days and let people use them however there s no approval process and no notice required just say you re not going to be working no reason needed we also do second of work full work day and pto is only taken in full day increments i ve always liked that and don t get the idea of sick days it s like if you can have pto days or pto days and sick days what s the difference i get it if you re saying you d rather have pto days and sick days but then just say you want more days off not that you want separate sick days
right we have to waste all our time off being in pain or sick or going to f king doctors appointments
voluntarism is a iq theory that ignores all aspects of the way society works
way more polite than i would have been time to start your new chapter good luck and hopefully the new company understands your value
years at the same company why
damn yrs that s some loyalty given that there was no movement
at my company if we say we have expressed interest in moving up the ladder but have not managed to do so it is common practice for management to turn that back on the employee well what have you done to improve yourself that you feel you should have been promoted did you complete an employee development plan recently which is basically a self examination that can be copy and pasted into a pip at the flick of a button the last time i interviewed for a position one above my pay grade the senior vp admitted our company has a crappy training and mentorship program so it s either continue to toil away at what i m doing here with low expectations or move somewhere else and probably have the same experience
i was in that same position as well yrs and we decide to move to a bigger city since the company continued to ignore me and never promote or give me a better title at least over the new hires that had the same title as me they continued to say we haven t had time to work on it the last yrs but you had time to do it with the security team and network teams but not ours see ya i now make 20k more a year and fully remote with a higher level title
just out of curiosity would you stay if they offer you some sort of promotion to keep you it seems like with that much experience they would be better served to keep you than let you go
do it
in early s i worked for a company and rose to the number two position i made a lot of good changes such as raises for employees newequipment for work and built a billing system that went from colletability to over collectability after doing all that good the corporation sent a new district vice president to the office to take over she garrassed me to no end and tire down all the good i had done that resulted in a high turnover in employees in an industry that costs thousands of dollars to train new employees my retention was and after her assumption of control it went to when i handed in my resignation she had the audacity to tell me i couldn t quit until she said i could i live in an open shop state i didn t need her permission to quit i went on to work for another company that appreciated my skills and paid me accordingly i worked for then until i retired the second company paid me a salary for two years after i retired that is how much they appreciated what i did for that company today they are still using my upgrades to the company years later they went from loosing about percent to making a profit of percent now i talk to the ceo from time to time i enjoy my retirement even though the ceo tries to get me back from time to time
on my birthday thank you
years jesus christ
congratulations and best of luck in your future
dude you told them i m sure that line that said i have expressed my interest in moving up the ladder is gangster stuff
no promotion for years wtf i wouldn t have stayed
years my dude you definitely deserve better good luck
well done best of luck to you at your new job
good luck with your future journey
can t believe you waited years f ck them
i work for my families company ive been here about years now ive had one pay raise i keep telling myself ill own the company one day but im really tired living paycheck to paycheck and feeling like i never have money to do anything it all goes to rent and food and when i am able to save up money life always happens i literally feel like im behind in life now because of this im debating if i take my skills and knowledge to a competitor or a similar type company and get a raise to where i can possibly start getting ahead in life or i keep working here under the promise that one day ill be able to make figures as the owner of the company honestly my biggest complaint is im lonely man i wanna meet more people and struggle to do it in my everyday life and my work life is so isolating i rarely get to meet new people x200b maybe i should get a therapist
ayyyye i work at a company that works with great american good luck
good luck here s hoping they don t fuck you on the last weeks or pto don t take the counter
years ffs they don t care about you and never did
very respectful and to the point good luck with future endeavors
the real question is why you didn t leave after three years and be in a much better position now who expresses interest for years
you should just get a better job and leave they wouldn t give you notice if they fired you plus that would show them the same respect they showed you the last years by not giving you a chance to move
years they re laughing behind your back
looks professional and courteous what are you doing in this sub
that s quite a novel you wrote there mine was a bit shorter but still ticked the boxes of a professional resignation letter
s he waited years
sounds like you didnt actually have much opportunity tbh
this isn t real this is a tame vanilla resignation letter with zero edge
there was an executive assistant at my old workplace who had been stuck forever and seemed miserable it s most likely gender discrimination if you are a woman best of luck on your next job
you were probably not that good at your job anyways if even after years you re still an assistant
that s about 5x as many words as needed
oof sorry it took so long good luck
i ll bet they were terminated the moment they received the letter
i like the letter but i think you ve outed yourself
years doesn t matter in alot of companies anymore they will get someone else to do your role maybe with cost savings go do you somewhere else
sadly with many companies there isn t a way to move up best to you in your next move
yr wtf were you doing earlier years should made the move or should resigned years ago they used you your lost here
didn t know assistants have a career ladder lol
damn sometimes i am mad at myself for wasting years in a dead end job i m glad i m not the only one who did that you ve made the first step good luck
years is way too long to wait for a promotion
waiting years isn t very proactive i d leave that bit out during the interview process leaving a job for something that s been happening for years without another lined up may not look strategic either what have you done on your own to improve yourself there
great letter good for you
it should end with respectfully yours just to burn it in
better late than never best of luck on your journey
i thought that was the company from the rainmaker for a moment
thank you your words are much appreciated
i wouldn t always agree but after years this as fuck
i m a glutton for punishment
i m my industry people usually take their experience and job shop every few years it seems like the experience you gain is more valued by a new company you can get a 25k raise at a new company when your current company will offer you like
the devil you know kinda thing i guess i m sure most of that time was in relative comfort changing gigs can be a risk it s often the best move but can still be scary
today was my last day at company after almost ten years i stayed because i enjoyed the work my coworkers and my managers then the old ceo retired and the new ceo removed every single perk drove out a bunch of senior employees and blamed everyone who started leaving for not being built for the kind of change this organization needs i probably would ve stayed if it wasn t for him
i ve been at the same job for years now due to lack of better options without relocation i cannot relocate due to family so i have to make due
i am also 18y at the same company because i like the job bad
right i was good at making excuses for staying
in this particular division the reason i ve not been promoted is because management is cheap greedy and selfish they get bigger bonuses when expenses are low salary is an expense
unfortunately job hopping gives you better pay rises than annual pay reviews my biggest pay rise from an employer was 4k the biggest i ve gotten from changing jobs is 20k
so glad it worked out for you sounds like you ve got a great job now well deserved
hard no way too late for that
tomorrow s the big day i can t wait
what an amazing career you ve had in your first job you helped a lot of people live better lives through their employment that is something to be proud of it s not right that one person can come in and change that environment so drastically i don t understand how they get away with it glad you did so well in your second job as well happy retirement to you
happy birthday
it went by very quickly lmao
thanks i m looking forward to this new chapter albeit a little scared
hahaaa i m telling them tomorrow can t wait to be a gangster
i shouldn t have but here i am now
thank you
thank you
thank you
i can t believe it either on the upside to that it helped in my negotiations with the new job
it s a shame your family doesn t pay you what you deserve you would think out of all the employers your family members would be the ones that would push for your success more than anyone maybe it s time you took the risk too don t wait as long as i did don t sacrifice you present life for your future especially since it s not guaranteed
one pay raise in years that s fucked up have you been trained all the different departments of the company to know how they operate if the answer is no you are not being groomed for leadership and you should expect not to be given the company ever
thanks
thanks i won t take the counter if there is one
they won t be laughing tomorrow
i would have only put my last day of work and thats it the rest they can fuck off they dont deserve more from you
dude ive been there too massively overstayed at my last job best of luck in your next pursuit
companies traditionally do not value the employees they already have and it gets worse every year they will however pay more for a new shiny employee always be the latter job hop early and often also your years of skills are tied directly to only one company versus a range of companies
extra gluttony when you work in insurance
stockholm syndrome
my youngest son took a job right out of college that he kept for years a company that there was a satire show on south park i usually don t tell my grown sons what to do but i finally had to tell him he needed to move on he did and he was so much better after he left that company good luck and have fun
find a hot sadist it s much more fun to be a masochist in a way that actually serves you
been there too what type of positions are you targeting you seem fairly experienced
loyalty tax in full effect
same here been at the same place for and counting
exactly i start job shopping around months
you are absolutely correct
no better raise than a new employer
well i ve gotten only one time in my career a salary adjustment of 30k additional salary increase then the next two years i got no raise then they fired that vp and i started to get them again when he got hired he didn t like certain people for whatever reason i got real close to quiting but yep job hoping gets you bigger raises but don t do it too quick or it can also hurt you
thank you and hope you find something as well
fair enough i was just curious good luck and congrats
don t blame you on that one i hate wasting my time and i try my best to extend that to other people as well once i m at the level of putting in job applications it s too late i m already gone it s just a matter of time too many shithole companies are reactive instead of being proactive oh you re leaving wait a minute wait a minute look what we can do for you you re telling me every time i want appreciation and recognition i m gonna have to go interview accept another position and then serve you a notice i don t think so
poop on the bathroom floor
thanks you made my day
you are on to better things though i m happy for you
mmm no years no promotion means your role is easily replaceable
they are trying to part on amicable terms so as to not poison that relationship if they have the last years of their career wrapped up with that employer poisoning that relationship could cause massive long term damage going forward if that employer decides to whisper poison into the ears of inquiring firms
thank you
i m a gluttony queen
bootlickers who equate hours worked instead of measuring product or value produced arent worth the effort ask them when they gave up on work smarter not harder working less and creating more from less is a sign of advancing forwards
i work 12hrs a day nine days a week i wish i could do more for my company and society i have nothing outside of work at work i complain and berate people who work regular hours i feel i m more dedicated an important than they are so i boss them around
not here to brag or sound like a judgmental condescending pos but just to talk about what i know best my own country i know there are many explanations to justify the massive differences between the us and france but for example here full time work week is hours 5th shortest worldwide we still work on average hours a week but on average around hours less per year than a us worker we also have one of the most vacation days per year worldwide and one of the lowest retirement age our productivity is still one of the highest on earth and we also have the 5th highest minimum wage worldwide and on average the cost of living is around lower than in the us not even talking about weeks of mandatory maternity leave minimum paid up to weeks for your third child for twins and for triplets or up to months of fully paid sick leave we stand up for ourselves together as a nation should to fight for our rights and make things better for everyone cause a victory for one is a victory for all of us are covered by some sort of collective agreement bargain 2d highest worldwide being underpaid and overworked is not the flex some think it is you re not a hero but the victim of a fucked up system enjoying being a submissive malleable indoctrinated masochistic bootlicker is not a valid point to justify exploitation
people could be of much more use to society if their wage work didn t dominate their entire life more free time means better rested kinder healthier people who can be active members of their community
so it takes you hours a week to accomplish what i can do in this isn t the burn you think it is
corporations want all the fruits of the peoples labors without paying them a wage lol
i work days a day why because i divide my day in mini days so then in hours i have days so at noon i start a new workday and at 6pm it s a brand new day so i work more than you do i m dominating the hell out of these hours i m just better than you s on a serious note i believe some dude said something like this in a podcast can t remember who was it
he probably spent most of his free time drunk and was abusive to his wife and kids too
lots of oil and gas people work s would prefer to work s and have a day weekend every week
hours theybare clearly bad at time management
day hours or days for real
i don t believe people who say this about working hours a week have ever worked hours a week if you actually have ever worked hours a week you become well aware of how unhealthy it is i guess some people don t but that s some next level dissociation
this boomer and some of the gen x crowd man smh so lacking in awareness empathy so closed minded emotional intelligence non existent such a fucked reality they ve created for themselves work without passion for days a week hour days to be a use to society how self aggrandizing it s ridiculous then the greedy toddler response of wanting others to suffer like they have instead of championing a better life pathetic you disgust me you boomers and some of you gen xers life is meant to be lived
others should suffer because i did is some of the utmost big brain functional society building ideology there is stop working hours a day days a week you re only being useful to your employer who is taking advantage of you until you re too used up to work
most jobs that significantly contribute to society pay very little or are very physical labor
i work hour shifts but only shift work so i get months off a year and can work extra days if needed
you re not benefitting society you re benefitting your company maybe that s your whole world though now i m sad for you
um you can be of much greater use to society by not being a toxic asshole towards others
people who are so badly indoctrinated by capitalism that they only measure themselves this way is a waste of flesh let them work themselves to death while sane people try to build a society where your worth is measured in more humane ways
https://www.wgal.com/article/pennsylvania-lawmakers-propose-tax-credit-for-employers-that-offer-4-day-workweek/43148998 a study that came out of the uk they had roughly businesses participate in this program they saw that productivity actually went up the entities made more money and had a better retention rate madsen said productivity didn t really go up go read the study it was based on things like productivity measured by revenue and how managers felt it was also based on things like revamping their businesses to accomodate day work weeks like reducing time spent on unnecessary things aka bad processes and meetings but the actual details of the bill including how much the credit would be and who qualifies are still being worked out very dissapointed in these politicians and yes i favor shorter hours but shorter hours isn t the most important thing for american workers right now we need better pay and better benefits
i plan my projects with the idea of under promise and over perform i ve seen other people at my level make absurd promises that always fall short while they work their team ragged if i don t put crushing demands on my team they perform better and we have a much better chance of wrapping up projects sooner and with less fuck ups also they know that they can rely on me as a leader when things do go sideways or someone made a mistake i don t tear their head off we just find where we went wrong fix it and figure out where we went wrong so that we all learn from it in years i have only called my team in outside of work hours before and that was because of a massive failure with the server and we needed to sort out recovery i honestly thought that everything had been lost on a month project
so op you should know as an accountant that even as a salary worker unless you re in management or c level you re actually eligible for overtime for those hours over salary workers with a few exceptions i m looking at tech industry are absolutely supposed to get ot for hours over
four hour days doesn t sound so bad gives you a nice day weekend i don t see what the problem is
i d be wary of using the term bootlicker for anybody that s making north of six figures it may apply to some who had to resort to sucking up to get their jobs but not all hour day weeks is typical for some field technical positions at least in my industry
still won t move back bc of their stupid lunch debt x cps
im glad he is working so much no one has to see him great work for that guy working himself to the bone makes younge rpeople realize thats a bad idea
i don t mind doing 12s as long as i m busy and not on standby or on call i like the fat checks a day work week would mean more overtime
what is this poster even saying you should negotiate for worse terms of employment
what benefits is he referring to overpriced healthcare lack of pensions social security that won t exist when i m a family that never sees me maybe i m in the wrong field
what s funny is this guy is likely not contributing very much to society by working excessive hours for whatever company odds are high he s in a warehouse factory or oil mining industry and his man hours have very little to no impact on even his local community if he had more time off he might be able to pursue a craft or hobby that actually helps people including himself and he d be more productive when he is at work so if he s working a job that does have an impact it would be greater under less strenuous hours
something good and humane being proposed bootlickers no
someone clearly has never worked a bullshit job for the paycheck that did fuck all for society
please use me sir i am just a hole for society sir
nobody s gonna remember that guy s name when he s dead no matter how much use he was to society
buddy is being overworked and is totally fine with it
we work more than feudal peasants life is supposed to be about more than work
i can t even front i work in a place that has almost exclusively people looking for free money people unwilling to do the bare minimum and nothing set in place to hold them accountable we have a day work week and it s great not being able to see them for days
i m upset that future generations might get to live more comfortably than i did i want everyone to have to work until they die in hypercapitalist dystopia
who wants to bet the bootlicker in question has a job which doesn t provide any kind of benefit to society in any way like sales or admin or even actively causes harm like lobbying marketing mlms etc
these are the same people who think work from home means not workinf
i remember those days worked hours a day days a week in public accounting and i am still poor still can t afford rent i am told to budget and cut back and do without many things i wanted i am told to take public transportation and wake up early to meal prep then at the end of the day performance review comes around and look at that no promotion for me and i was so close too maybe if worked on saturdays too then i will get a promotion yeah that never worked out for me here s what did work worked less at my job studied my ass off got another job with another company studied some more got promoted after passing my exams so no no more overtime for me
i also work hour days five days a week and this dude can eat my entire ass
flexing being overworked is fucking disgusting man i ll never understand this shit people wanna work themselves to death i was when my dad died at that s time i ll never fucking get back because he was busy as shit working himself to death
i want to be of use to society said some manager of a company no one cares about smh
op can t spell not even
is he actually saying i am glad to be overworked and underpaid so that my employer can reap the benefits of my labor because that is what it looks like i have worked and hour weeks then had a number of and hour weeks to balance out
good little drone and like a drone once you get to old or injured you ll be tossed aside and the corporation will laugh at your stupidity as they buy another boat
the mindset is that no one else s quality if life can improve because theirs sucked not everyone wants to grind themselves into a pulp and that s ok
if you wanted to be of use to society go get a fucking doctorate and push the bounds of known knowledge don t fucking act like digging ditches for hours a day is saving lives this is the type of person who brags about working hours a day and goes to work to take hour long shits and nap half the day because he s so fucking miserable at home the audacity
they are mad because they are probably living on overtime nobody on salary acts like that
lol because you are living in usa and there is no human rights that s the why and you are stupid enough to think your low paid labor is saving the world
cry me a river bitch i actually want to enjoy my life peacefully watch my children grow up as opposed to being confined to a job for so much of my time
today s young folk want better benefits livable wages and respect we should strive to make future generations better not worse
they cry about how hard they work but then play the lottory they know they don t want to work they are just scared to admit it
as someone who moved to pa back in september i hope to god this happens
let them cry
the absolute insane take of my life sucks so your life should also suck
we have to vote and change the landscape boomers outvote us to unless we change that the status quo will remain not sure when people will get this your vote is the most powerful tool you have boomers know this
my great grandfather worked hour shifts in a coal mine when he was this bootlicker is lazy as fuck
work is life and life is work
hopefully the machines will make it so we don t have to work at all
imagine having the boot so far down your throat that you can t even imagine contributing anything useful to society without being instructed to do so by your superiors
literally every study tells us productivity increases with a day week so
working long days was glorified back when society was only a few million people strong it isn t now it s okay to spread out the work load million people can have day work weeks and be more productive
the i worked shitty hours so you should too crowd old man get off my lawn
not everyone is a mindless zombie i used to work with people like that fuck that shit i missed so much time with my family that i started hating myself
and we cracked skulls and got scalped to take the stretch of land we got here right now the fuck is stopping me from giving you a taste of our founders disposition
you hate your family and would rather work yourself to death than spend time at home with them we get it
and who taught them to think this way dumbass
can t be that useful when young people are doing the same amount of work with a day to spare
bullshit very few people work out if a sense of nobility
i m going to go outside and yell at the clouds
couldn t resist replying i can get at least as much done in hours as you did in sorry you suck at your job
old people mad progress
god i love josh shapiro happy i voted for him and happy with his government
someone has that guy convinced he s of use to society
a true advancement in civilization is less work better quality of life working hours a day is not a flex you re either extremely inefficient at what you are doing or the company you are working for is a piece of bloated shit
hours worked per week has been on a steady decline for the past century a few angry boomers and gop trolls cannot stop the inevitable march of progress especially as ai creates big change
wait pennsylvania pa anything in there about raising the minimum wage up from i ve been fortunate enough to not have to work at that rate and most places can t hire anybody for less than hr so i haven t seen a posting for min wage since pre pandemic at the latest but i don t think my fellow workers for be toiling for that garbage wage
thus guys literally like i work hard for society and then screw the others in my society if they want anything
bootlickers will say shit like this collect their ot benefits and regular wages but then tell students they re privileged for expecting a decent paying job after completing a four year overpriced investment while simultaneously working unpaid internships the entire time
jfc hour days for days a week that s like hours really what we want is to get the benefits of working literally just surviving in capitalism without becoming a soulless bitter husk like that guy
why is making more and working less seen as a bad thing just because you work less hours doesn t mean you don t work as hard or get all the same work done i work days instead of and i work harder but i just enjoy the extra day off even the owner the boss the head honcho wants that day off every week and he s not even young it s not just kids who want to work less it s everybody cause we re all tired from doing the same shit that gets us no where and just want to live and enjoy life outside of work
if the job isn t in the medical field paramedic fire department or police then i don t know what job the person has that they believe makes them a use of society i worked as a cashier at target should i consider that job abuse of society i don t think so
great you become a tool
i just want to ya know like enjoy existence not waste my life fucking slaving away for capitalists just so i can barely afford to survive
actually happy to live in pa for once because of this but fuck that guy
iny very specific situation day work weeks would probably fuck me pretty hard honestly i m not a monster so i understand they would help most people so i hope they come anyway but the reason i d be fucked is i make a lot working overtime my work has been trying to curb overtime obviously if they were mandated a day work week they for sure would just make two shifts for the week and totally get rid of ot and lots of people would be stuck working fri sat sun every single week so i d probably lose out on 15k of overtime a year and possibly get stuck on weekends for the foreseeable future
that guy would be really pissed to learn i haven t worked a hr week in probably years and i now have truly unlimited pto and i usually take a nap everyday around
folks in overemployed group printing millions while people here complain about work some of them are probably nearing retirement after working jobs over last years
so about the four day push i have questions about are we talking ten hours a day for four days to make up for the fifth or an increase in pay to make up for the fifth or the fifth is overtime i d love to have a third day off but i only make ends meet with my hour weeks i just don t see how it would work if eight hours are cut from my check
i feel you i can t wait until april
i unfortunately do for 130k plus benefits do you want your gas at the gas station well i m the poor sucker who does it
no i want far more benefits in half the time
i work 12h days and 12h nights it s horrible and i don t have a work life balance
hmm a progressive bill being proposed fuck promoting that let me scour the interwebs for a bootlicker to promote
right right right did you walk uphill both ways in the snow every day to school too
just because you got ripped off and sold your time away to a company doesn t mean we have to keep coping
i don t understand peoples willingness to work their lives away in service of someone that directly benefits from their labor but never rewards them for it i guarantee you nobody ever lies on their death bed and thinks i should have worked harder to make that other guy rich
he s lying gen xmz work weeks are longer than boomer work weeks boomers destroyed the unions that gave us the hour week so they could like ronnie rayguns boots now we work more hours than they japanese
if you want to do mass layoffs in the netherlands you have to prove financial difficulties company wide and have a social plan which means helping people find other jobs and severance pay its a bit more complicated but in short it is hard to just fire someone let alone a large group of employees
after announcing the largest rounds of layoffs in their history us big tech companies are now learning how difficult it is to reduce headcount in europe in the us companies can announce widespread job cuts and let go of hundreds if not thousands of workers within months and many have meanwhile in europe mass layoffs among tech companies have stalled because of labor protections that make it virtually impossible to dismiss people in some countries without prior consultations with employee interest groups this has left thousands of tech workers in limbo unsure about whether they ll be affected by negotiations that can drag on indefinitely in france google parent alphabet inc googl is currently in talks to reduce headcount through voluntary departures offering severance packages that it hopes are generous enough to get workers to leave people familiar with the matter said asking not to be identified because the information isn t public amazon amzn has tried to get some senior managers there to resign by dangling as much as one year s pay and has granted leave to departing employees so their shares can vest and be paid out as bonuses one person with knowledge of the situation said both in france and germany where labor laws are among the strongest in the eu google is currently in negotiations with works councils company specific groups whose elected employee representatives negotiate with management about workforce issues according to a person familiar with the matter by law companies are required to bargain with these councils before implementing layoffs a sometimes lengthy process that includes information gathering negotiations and the possibility of recourse we need reform in the us politicians are bought and paid for and do not represent their constituents but instead their corporate partners edit spelling
that s why amazon is trying to get the employees back to the office they hope some will quit
oh no workers have protections outside the us poor multibillion dollar corporations anyway
the american dream is leaving america
won t somebody think of the multinational corporations
i hope google and amazon lose each and every lay off case and are sued for billions in damages from this burn them both down and salt the earth under them may we forget they ever existed
the publisher of the article being bloomberg owned by the oligarch of the same name they really go out of their way to make it sound like this is bad for the workers who are on the cutting board they re in limbo they say and as we all know that s far worse than being unemployed
interesting concept in some european countries having to prove laying off employees is financially necessary and needed quarterly profits not rising last quarter isn t a valid reason i m sure like it is here in the us or wanting to do a round of stock buybacks for shareholders
good it should be hard to lay workers off just because the eps for the shareholders wasn t as high as they wanted
hope it s a big drag on the bottom line boycott these companies
god it sucks here in the us lmao
cry me a river
i would trade my us citizenship for eu citizenship in a cocaine heartbeat
america needs more chaos and more death of politicians
because labor laws actually work in europe
i can t believe all these big businesses operate in the socialist hell holes of europe don t they know their taxes to pay for all this employee welfare are through the roof how did they even afford to stay in business there for so long s
because these companies in these countries germany and france hire a person for life they don t hire a lot of people they use contractors a lot of them since the government pays for free healthcare and retirement many of these companies have more contractors than full time employees i consult for a french owned company where of my co workers in europe are contractors those that do manage to get hired win the jackpot with much better benefits time off vacations healthcare and pensions this is the reason that so many people in the year old group are unemployed the companies don t want to hire full timers
it s shit in europe too just on a different level capitalism reached its limits revolution or not
this is why labor protections are so damn important
from the article this has left thousands of tech workers in limbo unsure about whether they ll be affected by negotiations that can drag on indefinitely or as i prefer to see it from a workers perspective this gives them valuable time to hunt around for another job so they re not left high and dry
or go the musk route and just say laws don t apply to me i m really really rich and fire them anyway and oh what s this another lawsuit i ll add it to my lawsuit pile which in the eu is really really going to bite him on the arse
cheaper to keep them on and just fire more folks back in the us going forward they won t hire as many employees in the countries that make it this difficult to lay off people
wow i hope google and amazon are okay
another example showing how poor the us labor laws are not to mention about weeks of paid vacation guaranteed for the majority of european countries someone plz correct me if i m wrong man even in my native brazil most employees specially in white collar and tech have protections and guaranteed severances after dismissal actually have a buddy who s company based out of so paulo almost went under after having to pay over r about 45k usd
shit damn sorry jeffie baby
well boo fucking hoo cry me a river why don t ya
may we then see more layoffs in the us as a result companies still will feel the need to reduce costs and here we have no protections surely not having similar protections is a threat to our labor market
they will get it it just takes more red tape when i worked for boeing we stopped physically printing manuals in frankfurt and laid of a ton of people they went to the council and got it done i like days sane as our domestic warn
all this will teach them is that the next time they should make the vast majority of the cuts in the us where workers don t have much protection
pardon me i need to go find the world s smallest violin
perhaps they should just not engage in groupthink and lay off people when there s no reason to besides everyone else is but of course executives are usually idiots
this happened to me several years ago worked a corporate job with a huge fortune company half the team was us of the team was eu and a quarter indian all of the us got laid off 10s of people just on that team everyone else stayed that company ended up laying off 50k people over the next years
man this is fucking great
the company i work for hired a consultant firm to help them cut of the workforce we re a global company they were in such a rush to get it done they didn t do any due diligence about local laws outside the us so now all non us employees are in limbo waiting to find out if they still have a job but are expected to continue to work people lost their jobs but the executives take full responsibility the same type of taking responsibility a child does when they break the tv and say sowwy if only the goddam us had actual worker protections
i just found out my company is rolling out large layoffs and i will be out of a job after working there for a decade was played off as overstaffing issues only while simultaneously telling us they ll be offshoring our work usa usa usa
this has left thousands of tech workers in limbo unsure about whether they ll be affected by negotiations that can drag on indefinitely trying to sound like this is bad for workers
same here in france you need to prove that your company actually financially needs to fire people to be able to stay in business and you have to pay compensation help your employees to find a new job and or pay for some training in google france almost doubled their profits compared to why the fuck should they need be allowed to fire anybody makes no sense at all https://www.france24.com/en/business/20220202-google-parent-alphabet-nearly-doubles-annual-profit](https://www.france24.com/en/business/20220202-google-parent-alphabet-nearly-doubles-annual-profit)
do you feel like there s any downside to this like is it any harder to find a job for a example netherlands sounds like a paradise
makes moving to the netherlands and moving out of the us sound like a better idea
i m an nl salaried my boss effectively cannot fire me unless i m seriously messing up leaking company data intentionally doing harm other than that counsel is required and they have to pay me as usual while that s in effect
that s just making me want to move there even more canada isn t much better than the us in terms of labour laws
my understanding is our office there they have year contracts you can just not renew them and it s fine but firing outside that window is hell our layoffs are always at that time of year we hire the bare minimum amount of people in that country and our r d and support centers in other eu countries with lower protections
google and amazon have tons of cash
even then the works council needs to approve it and the company needs to show that there are no other options and that the layoffs are in the best interest of the company and not some short term solution the social plan also needs to be approved and can be adjusted by the works council the fun part about a works council we are all co workers elected by co workers in nl a co workers council is mandatory if a company has more than co workers working for an international company in nl can be quite challenging yet interesting if management is not familiar with the dutch law regarding coworker councils
we need reform in the us politicians are bough and paid for and do not represent their constituents but instead their corporate partners that s laughable especially since politco just broke news that one of the us scotus and his wife gets kickbacks vacations from a billionaire friend people don t run for office to help their constituents they run to line their pockets here in the great u s of a
the whole structure is rotten from the foundation up reform won t work the house must be rebuilt
austria labour laws are also very strong not as strong as france but maybe same strength as germany
although i m not for persistent standing unions i ve come to realize it s the only way sadly everything has to be unionized or guilded if you want to be treated fairly
if only they regulated tech companies like they do in europe i mean earning less than half of what i do now in the us job market would suck but maybe it would be worth it edit that was sarcasm btw
period
office building landlords hate this one simple trick
they also have there or at least in california musk somehow managed to break even those few laws
bold of you to assume it was ever in america in the first place s
to be fair it s a bloated rotting corpse by now loooooong dead
bloomberg forbes financial times washington post are just propaganda machines
they re in limbo they say and as we all know that s far worse than being unemployed there s actually a fairly large mental toll to being in limbo it talks into imposter syndrome and extended periods of boredom cannot be good you can pay your bills but it does come at a cost
taxes amazon doesn t make any profit in the uk that warrants taxes
as an eu citizen that does not like macdonald s fiveguys burger king etc those usa and entities and their ceos run alongside other humans with limited capacity to see beyond themselves can come and clean the plastic and microplactics and s h o v e all of it up their a s s will help the environment
that has nothing to do with youth unemployment
sure the pay for a lot of jobs is shit labor laws etc are _a lot_ better than in the us you can t even compare it with it s shit in europe too
how so just wondering
they don t they hire contractors in some cases such as the company i consult for they have more contractors than full time employees this is also why the year old group is the biggest unemployed demographic in these countries this is also why this group is rioting since france extended the retirement age keeping the older folks in their jobs means fewer jobs for the young groups
their problem
profits bitch usa
all the companies making cuts are profitable but if they fire people they can be even more profitable
but won t somebody please think of the shareholders
because it s their money and they want it now
it s the same in other countries in europe
the downside is if you re a company who wants to lay off workers and start buying back stock with all the money you ve saved on labor otherwise not really
i do want to add that this is with certain types of contracts if you have a short work contract they can just choose to not renew it
there are definitely a few downsides the most obvious is that it is difficult to fire bad employees i used to work in sweden and had this terrible boss she bullied me and my peers denied our vacation requests i missed my best friends wedding piled way too much work on us and on and on the company new about this all of the senior management wanted her gone but it took almost years before they were able to put a case together and fire her now that s an inconvenience for large companies but think of a small family owned business you can just start becoming and alcoholic and not show up to work for months meanwhile the company has to pay you and they have to provide you with treatment so that smaller family business might now have to close its doors because a few bad employees that aren t working but the company is still paying them and last lower wages in general benefits come at the expense of pay i ve worked in eu countries and the u s and my take home pay is triple or more what it was in the eu a month in the us going straight to savings vs a month across the eu yes that accounts for healthcare insurances taxes retirement phone bill everything edit also like when i worked in germany i had a month notice period the company had to give me months if they wanted to fire me but at the same time i had to give months notice as well so say you re stuck with a really shitty boss or coworker and you put in your months notice that s months they can make your work life a living hell i saw it happen to a friend of mine overall after the countries i ve lived in i d put us and germany at the top as ones i would want to live work in again sweden and uk no thanks and spain was awesome but the pay was just quite low would be great to retire in
of course there s a downside the us has much higher wages if you never get sick are amazing at your job don t wnt kids will never have a single issue ever and don t care about anyone but yourself you will have a much better life in the us if you any of those apply to you europe is probably better for you r kids
not being able to fire someone is a downside sometimes people are truly toxic and need to go not just because they re bad worker but because they make other people who go to work feel like crap
of course it is harder to find a job there and if you do the pay is vastly less for europeans there is the benefit that they don t have to emigrate for americans it can be nice to go for a few years to sow the royal oats
tech companies don t locate larger support or r d centers in the netherlands
america is draconian with respect to workers rights worst in the developed world and most of the developing world
most don t i m still holding out faith that their are a few good ones out there still trying to help us little guys
and sometimes to make some criminal charges to go away when their son rapes a classmate or murders a prostitute
not really we are an at will employer state and companies pay in lieu of notice but some don t and it takes years to go through the legal system here because it s such a litigious climate
wait you actually have a point though have you seen all the elderly dying bankrupt or being evicted from assisted living recently
i think he s saying the american dream is to leave america
it s safe to say almost all us media and uk are propaganda machines
i know i lived through it when my dad s company went through multiple rounds of layoffs in the s always wondering if he was going to be included the next round it s different here they know the company wants to fire them but the limbo they re in gives them time to get their stuff in order and to start looking for options it definitely beats being laid off on the spot
young people struggling to be hired has nothing to do with unemployment
even if it s shit in the eu and in the us it seems like less shit in the eu lol
europe is a paradise then
this is an incredibly in depth and informative answer thank you so is the decision you think even though uk is as rich as the us they will usually pay a little less to the uk for the same role because they know the employees already receive a lot of their benefits from the state
you can t fire someone for not coming to work
then write them up and fire them being a pos doesn t keep you from getting fired anywhere
ty and what is sowing royal oats
the usa is a 3rd world country with a gucci belt and nukes
but but we need a skeleton crew to pull long hours doing the work of twice their number so that our corporate friends can keep their profits on the rise when selfish europe won t left them lay off personnel yes that s s in case it wasn t clear
well if companies have to go through such hurdles to become efficient in changing markets it will only incentivize them to pay less and hire less
there s a handful of not completely soulless politicians out there sure but they are utterly inconsequential against the vast power and control wielded by of the rest of america s politicians
assholes love having power over others and are pretty good at getting it as long as those positions of power are open it s mostly going to be assholes sitting in those chairs
so far the ones that actually have a moral compass that come to mind are bernie sanders john fetterman and maxwell frost first gen z to be elected to congress
no please tell us more actually i often wonder what old age will look like for me in america i think right about now i won t be reaching it due to future medical issues
there are no jobs for them or the pay is so low that working is simply not worth it you are comparing the job market in the us with the one in europe europe never recovered from the financial crisis that started in the us years ago europe has no oil nor natural resources
we have our fair share of problems we only seem paradise when compared with the dysfunctional dystopia that is usa
yes and even china is laughing at us too this is an analysis of our whole country https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202303/t20230320_11044481.html
they also put out an ad saying they have electric powered delivery vehicles across the country lol
that s just cause related marketing same goes with budweiser and their new spokeperson
yes it all part of the show the truth is a lot more gritty and nastier
lol sure like they would actually spend money on that
https://www.dominos.com/evfleet/ i guess the number has gone up a little since i saw the ad last year but here ya go for the entire country still ain t shit
better for the planet
dumbinos
guess we are really going to see french revolution part electric bogaloo and i hope it spreads
they have the right idea meanwhile here in usa we have meatheads making videos of themselves throwing out beer associated with an endorsement they don t like smh
it is in fact being shown on mainstream media across the western world
it was about the retirement age but if the system won t listen to a basic request it s time to change the system
mad respect
aux armes citoyens formez vos bataillons
god bless the french i hope they destroy it utterly
my proudest fap
the world will be watching le tour in a few months keep it up
it always your elite s goal to separate you and have you fight over bs problems that seem to only exist in america
methheads
for cease fire a no change in retirement age while millionaires and billiinaires exist b person house and no more houses for corporations housing as a right c also like netherlands already done make wfh becoming a right
what is this from also cant stand these people bag your fucking groceries dont stand there being useless sucking in air like dying fish
i once had a lady that wanted one item per bag she claims she had shoulder surgery although seemed to be moving around just fine she had about bags piled up over her head in her cart it looked ridiculous more bags more shoulder movement i say
in canada we bag our own groceries i just don t get why you wouldn t the cashier then helps the next person in while you are bagging
oddly satisfying
as a retail worker i hate the entitlement that americans in general have and i m saying this as an american myself it s just insane how angry some people get over the most minute things in most other countries i believe it s common practice for the customer to bag their own groceries yes we are retail workers and we scan your items but we also are not your slaves
beautiful
i wouldn t even have bothered in the first place you re not getting paid nearly enough for that fucking bullshit just stfu and bag your fucking groceries
this is why i use self checkout also there was no need for her to take out all the groceries while looking super salty to double bag after she had put like things in one bag
who s the cashier she s hot lol
oh i love this
jesus christ this is accurate af except i m checking out my own groceries and the karen is the self checkout attendant heckling my bagging abilities
mayans mc
where in canada do you live because i also live in canada and am expected to bag the groceries
dude when i was in austria they scanned my stuff i paid and they walked off i couldn t believe it at first because ya know i m american but my buddy i was visiting was like yeah that s totally normal
am i supposed to bag my own groceries i guess i m a cashier and there s a bunch of people behind you so yeah i just looked around and nobody is coming to assist make of that what you will
this is very much an everyone sucks here the customer was very condescending and annoying but also the cashier def way overreacted here which i think is the point but still
she s undeniably attractive but also you may have some unresolved trauma
need to watch this and sons of anarchy
in toronto every supermarket i go to the cashiers do not bag your groceries
huh yeah that s not the case over here i ll fully admit i get a bit lazy about it sometimes if customers have their own bags i m supposed to offer to bag their groceries even if they don t give me the bags i don t unless they give me the bags or it s slow and i want something else to do
when he says seize he probably means through eminent domain meaning the government will pay for the land meaning that if someone let s say jp morgan buys a ton of useless land before the announcement of the land purchase they can get an healthy profit
or they could ya know heavily subsidize adding solar to your rooftop require all new homes to have solar on rooftops all new buildings to have solar update old buildings to have solar and not take peoples land
if anything there s lots of empty spaces that are owned by the bureau of land management that could be used to that end or better yet the bureau of land management could be dissolved and the land returned to its original inhabitants and the native people of the west could make all sorts of money by putting up wind turbines and solar farms on their land and selling that electricity into the grid oh and jaime dimon can go blow a cactus
yeah they could for instance seize your unearned wealth and use it to buy land for those things
the means of production are currently private property i can get behind this idea
they can seize my property when jamie dimon and billionaires like him pay their fair share in taxes
there s something incredibly suspicious about this when it s dimon making the suggestion
i m going to guess jp morgan just bought a ton of land across the country and now want the government to seize it so they can turn it into a quick and healthy profit
from what i m reading there s plenty of land available they even have buildings on them in the city
sounds like a plan seize every jp morgan building in the country and attach solar panels to the exterior surface and a nice big wind generator on top
i wish solar was mandatory on commercial and warehouse buildings just think how many panels we could put on jaime dimon s front yard
imagine all of jp morgans assets being seized for the betterment of society
i thought antiwork died i guess it s still alive i come here to feel better about myself
in response i suggest that the workers should seize the means of production
someone was visited by ghosts
you know who owns a great deal of property that s at least partially developed that would often make it easier to build solar and windfarms people like jaime dimon with their wealth they often buy large tracts of land put a large mansion with huge roof areas and manicured grounds all of that could easily be covered in panels and have wind turbines installed
want reliable net zero support nuclear
i m sure he has the room
how many bank branches are they why not force him to cover every one of them with solar panels
once my billionaire friends and i have passed away he quickly added
i d gladly concede my property to build solar or wind farms if i get energy at zero cost
all billionaire assets over mill should be seized funnily enough people will still find ways to criticise that statement no human being or he ll even family needs or can consumer that amount in a lifetime not without hoarding assets
sure let s start with all the chase banks scattered around that are just continuously fleecing customers
did a capitalist really say something so communist
i hope they do to his property
let s start with his
when does the tar and feathering begin
ok let s start by seizing his property see how he likes that
buy the land lease the land don t take it jerk
lemme guess who wants to gobble up the tax credits and become a big lender to green energy
that s like your opinion man
seize private properties i agree with jp we should
or and hear me out on this maybe start putting solar covers over open air govt parking lots
maybe he s using scary language to poison the conversation and now politicians have some good sound bites to use to make renewables sound terrifying while this guy s company both gets their green clout and the money from non renewables
it sounds like jamie diamond is offering his personal property as an example
start with his
eh he can have some of my yard if i get first dibs on the energy i just don t want to mow
i will marvin heemeyer their asses
start with his property and then we ll talk
let s start with his private property
the government owns so much land in nevada how about start there
plenty of land along interstates and highways
i wonder how much private property jamie dimon or his bank owns seems like a good place to start
and then pay for it with molnet seized from jpmorgan
the utility companies just lease the land windmills go up rather than sideways so the surrounding land around them can still be used for things like agriculture there were over 70k commercial turbines at the beginning of maybe jp morgan and its executives need to pay more taxes to fund more turbines
the old doug ford special
they should be paying market value for the land so if the bank buys useless land they would be reimbursed for useless land i would assume the bank would pull some shenanigans here where they mildly improve the land then get it valued way higher however the government can also come in and deem your property worthless and basically force you take a small offer now banks have way more firepower to fight that but just saying that it wouldnt work quite the way you say
chavez ravine was stolen from the mexicans and mexican americans of los angeles through eminent domain geographers moved in declared the area a slum even tho it wasnt and stole their land to build dodger stadium this tactic is used in other countries as well
i don t think jpm holds a lot of land but they would be issuing loans to the companies buying the solar panels etc don t wind turbines cost like million each government acquires acres and jpm issues a million loan to build the turbines repeat in every state profit
alt seize all the land we ll need then give it to us to build power plants on we ll sell the energy back at a competitive price we promise
that s exactly what he says but this is from a daily caller article meant to scare everyone about globalists
he probably means one of those persky things he still has to pay every month is electricity and he wants to pay it to someone that doesn t have interest in getting a profit meaning the government should provide it but only because he doesn t want to pay for it
i don t think solar is good enough to put on residential roofs yet i know a lot of people have them but they are a pain to put up and a pain to take down for when the roof needs to be replaced also a lot of these solar companies seem to be rather predatory where they rush you to get you to buy them but then are difficult to contact after their contracts are terrible and lock you in and if you want out you have to pay some insane price even if you want to sell the house you have to convince the potential buyer into the contract
that is expensive as all hell i did the numbers for that awhile ago and at average install prices it came out to like 1t to equal the same as a 1gw nuclear power plant and nuclear is so over regulated that it costs aboit 20b for
that s doesn t make them money though
my guess is he jp morgan have some land they d liked to unload
help us marit stiles you re our only hope
when i was a kid the government took my families house in florida for a highway project and gave us a pretty large amount for compensation in the early 1900s my ancestors lived in west virginia and the government took their land so they could hand it over to a coal mining company and got jack shit
there s a scam people pull in china where the government pays compensation to people who are kicked out of their homes for infrastructure projects and stuff but the compensation formula is based on how many floors the house has so people build really shonky towers with as many floors as possible when they hear the land they re living on is getting taken back by the government this way they get so much compensation money they don t have to live in the poverty striken holesthey were in and can move somewhere good
if you actually get eminent domain ed you ll get some equivalence they initally offer high though in hopes you ll just take the deal so they don t have to drag you through the process
the interstate system was built through black neighborhoods because those had the lowest values those that didn t sell were imminent domained and compensated at a lower value than comparable reason because i freeway ran through the land it had less value than if a home were built on it that s even if they were compensated
jpm definitely either holds directly or to a subsidiary a lot of real estate and in an event when they know of a particular stretch of undervalued land that is about to get eminent domained they do buy it because after the government announces the project it goes up in value and the government usually buys land at a good price they ve done it in the past and i don t think they wouldn t do it now
finding land isn t the problem the real problem is lack of grid transmission capacity at this point both wind and solar are profitable so long as you can find a buyer in some places land value near transmission lines have increased in value simply because of the option competition from renewables
it s more like buy all the land we need from us then hire us to build and run the plants at a competitive price ofc
so all of these problems are solvable
i don t care if it s expensive i would much rather my tax dollars go to that as opposed to aid for fossil fuels or any number of other things my tax dollars go to that i don t agree with the real problem is it would cut into energy companies bottom line they don t want that
which is the real problem
sounds like your family has a knack for finding good real estate
west virginia land is cheap but everyone sold their mineral rights decades ago so at any point they could come in and start tearing up your property to get at coal or natural gas luckily west virgina passed a law recently that makes it a little harder for them to do it but it can still happen at any time another big problem with west virgina is their personal property tax where they tax you every year on your cars equipment pets livestock tractors ect we used to live in west virgina decades ago and we sold out and moved because my mom had a home business and the state was trying to tax her on every piece of furniture books you name it in the house
well look at what i found from february https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2023/02/02/jp-morgan-buys-acres-of-woodlands on wednesday jpmorgan s wealth management arm said it acquired acres of woodlands in the southeastern us for million
the business stuff yea the technological stuff will take time they are still trying to figure out how to make them slimmer and more efficient can put ones out on the ground but i would avoid hard to access areas like a roof
look what i m getting at is for the same price as all that roof top solar you could get nuclear plants and as much clean energy onto the grid replacing fossil fuel generation plus getting an extra trillion dollars per year slapped on to the national debt is just not gonna fly
probably lying
my grandparents bought a road grader for the sole purpose for grading the roads for the state free of charge because they couldn t keep them in service they flew a drone over their property and saw it and started taxing them
who would a thunk i didn t even need to go on the internet it s almost like i have a god given gift of premonition when it comes to capitalist tactics
expensive sure but look up solar shingle roofing and electricity in one product
i fully support nuclear i m also a big advocate of diversifying the energy grid as much as possible
they flew a helicopter over ours and found a vein of coal under my parent s house west virginia could be an amazing state but they tax everyone out of existence and run people out of the state even car insurance is way more expensive my parents moved across the river and their car insurance dropped by half
right let me go work for freeeee
i m sure the health inspector will love to hear about this one
i realized the airport was short staffed and now i m flying people to new york people are screaming and i m trying to google how to lower the wheels on this thing
people were all so worn out from working this shitty job with high turnover but luckily two fucking idiots had walked in
sounds more like a great way to get that one overworked employee fired for letting you work the kitchen
this has to be a lie whatever you have to say about denny s they are strict on not allowing anyone near the kitchen so they either lying or someone really dropped the ball
because a single denny s is too big to fail and requires even more exploitation of labor to get through the night
this whole story can just fuck right off
what in the actual hell it s not like they saw a burning building or something o we knew what we had to do yeah go home and cook at home and give those people a break potentially
this is literally literally why i explain to my dickhead colleagues that i won t work unpaid ot look it feels good to do the right thing yay go you stepping up selflessly you re making it better but it s a tiny off brand band aid over a huge oozing and infected wound because you know what happens when you save a company s bacon from getting burnt they keep doing it because they think hey we made it work on a skeleton crew and made money we ll do it again because we ll just get bailed out again these women didn t help anything in the long run denny s gets free publicity and numbers to prove they don t need a full crew to work these shifts in nine months when they re doing budgets they won t remember this specific date that two strangers walked in they re gonna see the monthly numbers and go ok three people are all we need what they should have done is turn around and go somewhere else because that s how business works business doesn t provide a good service you go somewhere that does money talks more than a good deed had they not helped denny s numbers would have plummeted more people would have quit and they would see their methods are not working so they either fold the business or raise wages and or hire more staff exactly why when my team asks me to stay late unpaid i say no because if our job can t make this work then it s definitely not working and leadership need to come up with a better plan all it s doing is staying the inevitable or worse making it impossible to be successful one of the best things i have been told is that you sometimes just let the thing burn down let it fail concrete failure can give the necessary push to a better future
do they have food safety training or even food handling shots like i get wanting to help out an all but do they know the food safe temps for the different meats medium rare chicken tendies is not cute if it gives you food poisoning or worse not trying to be rude but there are qualifications and food handling trainings and expectations for a reason i read the article and it said nothing about the women having any kind of experience in the food industry cooking for yourself or your family is very different than cooking in a restaurant s kitchen and i get the feel good vibe this story was trying to put out but and i get this may be down voted but i give no shits if i see a hospital short on surgeons i m not gonna scrub up and start cutting someone open nor am i going to walk into a automotive shop and start working on someone s car just because they are short staffed standards are established for a reason and trying to play the hero because you felt motivated in the moment doesn t mean shit if you can t prove you are qualified show me some serve safe certification
imagine volunteering to get dennys profits to its executives instead of like volunteering at a soup kitchen wild
a restaurant would literally rather shut down than allow non employees cook for customers not even talking about food health safety violations if one of those ladies accidentally hurt themselves in the kitchen lawsuit incoming so either there s more to the story or nobody was around to stop them from doing whatever they want
so what happens if someone got sick from eating the food they cooked
stupid fools
we both knew what we had to do yea say not my problem and gtfo
if walmart can make you check yourself out then dennys can make you cook for yourself
i ve never worked at a denny s but ive worked in kitchens and i just cant wrap my head around just letting random people jump in even if some idiot manager allowed this why would you help some chain restaurant i don t walk behind a desk and start answering calls or making appointments because the place is understaffed
this isn t feelgood this is a failed society
r orphancrushingmachine
normalizing free labor
absolutely fucking not even if they ate there breakfast lunch and dinner every day for a year they have zero idea of where things are prep cooking times the list is endless maybe maybe they could run food or wash dishes maybe m
this is a new low for bootlicking
ain t nothing feel good about working for free lol ya ll lost me on this one
at first i was like these women are either dumb stupid idiots or are seeking praise for doing something dumb and idiotic but as i read it i realized they re dumb idiots who probably were genuinely trying to do the right thing and didn t realize that what they were doing was dumb and idiotic and dangerous and foolish in the article it says the two actual employees working were repeatedly calling their manager for help to no avail and breaking down in tears because they were so overwhelmed what these random customers turned good samaritans should have done is reported the denny s called the manager themselves to show that customers don t appreciate this egregious exploitation of labor or reported the location to corporate or the better business bureau
did they get paid
i bet this should probably read two off the clock dennys employees from another dennys restaurant helped out other employees from same franchise
do they not realize that they re making the problem worse sure they might be helping the business but if a business is short staffed they are not meeting the demand pay that workers require don t give businesses any more handouts
i knew i recognized this bootlicking propaganda the same article from over months ago https://wearemitu.com/wearemitu/news/dennys-two-women-texas-staff/) in fact when you google this you ll find this same story from different new outlets over the last months pathetic
had to do no
no you call the owner and tell them to hire more workers or you ll start actively campaigning for people to boycott the place entirely they need more paid help make sure the owner knows that if anything force them to do the right thing these women just made it easier for this shit to continue
if i sat down for minutes and figured out the kitchen was empty depending on my level of hunger i m probably going back there and cracking some eggs it would most certainly not be a feel good story as opposed to i m so hungry i went to a fucking denny s so scoot over i m going to need that deep fryer
this is only acceptable if they took home all the cash while they were working
we both knew what we had to do ummm no you didn t have to do anything you don t work there and aren t paid for it
the law suit from potentially mishandling food or getting hurt cooking without being an employee is not worth it
so random people can get in the kitchen and cook for strangers i guess getting poisoned is now something you can get at denny s
plucky pair averts the total collapse of capitalism
these two idiots could have just gone to a food shelter to help people who need it
uh this might be a health code violation
good for them i d have not been in denny s in the first place diarrhea
if they got burned cut or slipped that wouldn t be good
sounds fake tbh
ah yes unqualified and probably unwashed hands touching food thanks
great now the boss can buy the car he wanted so much very wholesome
ah yes everyone can just jump on the line on a fast paced breakfast kitchen nothing could possibly go wrong here
next thing you know managers will start berating customers for not covering shifts
why would these two loons work for a multinational corporation for free what s the expected return personally i feel if dennys paid more they wouldn t have a staffing issue
things that didn t happen for alex
that s a health code violation they can t be doing that shit if you wanna help make pancakes at home and lighten their burden
do they like def leppard tho
lmaoooo who in their right fucking mind would do this
that s a liability bonanza waiting to happen can t have non employees working in your kitchen insurance doesn t cover them etc
one time at a buffalo wild wings during the pandemic they were so short staffed that i went and poured my own beer cuz the waitress was slammed and there was no bar tender i felt very accomplished
i m a line cook and if a customer ever tried that shit i would chase them out of the bar with a knife
why is this even a thing shouldt they be a liability
oh good i was worried the rich ass owner might not make a profit whew
and i m sure they had all the health and safety training and necessary safety sign offs to cook in a commercial kitchen right right
the fda would like a word
if this was actually legal and not a total lie i would cook my own food in exchange for an employee discount on it i also wish i could take my car to a mechanic and use their equipment to work on it myself that doesn t exist either i checked
maybe a waffle house but fuck dennys
r latestagecapitalism is what i thought at first second did either get hired or paid third could you imagine the lawsuit if one got burned or cut
knew what that had to do yeah leave go to another restaurant
if i m in the weeds in the back and two middle aged moms come on the line to help i m going to start stabbing people
we just looked at each other and it wasn t even a question we both knew what we had to do we stopped going to denny s
they are dumb
can someone cross post this on r boringdystopia i ll eat my shoe if it s not already there
oh my god i did almost exactly the same thing i went into a fast food place any it was really busy so i turned to my friend and we went somewhere else like normal people
pretty sure that s a health violation for the restaurant
and then the denny s was closed for a whole butt load of food safety and training laws
first off upworthy is still a thing secondly what s the feel good equivalent of not quite the flex you think it is while sure it was nice of them to jump in and help health codes notwithstanding but the actual story is how understaffed the restaurant was while probably simultaneously complaining that nobody wants to work
almost seems like propaganda but i can t tell cant be sure anymore with these articles
what a simp move
yeah it s a cool story because these are people that genuinely like working together and will jump on a situation to help but like wouldn t their skills be better at a soup kitchen or something
the reason it worked out so well because when people came in and heard there were random people cooking they left no customers no staffing issue
two women volunteer as slave labor for a giant corporation that refuses to pay its staff enough to keep them
this is unsanitary and against the law
we both knew what we had to do go some place that was properly staffed
i m a cook myself and i can promise that i will never do this shit for free
aren t there regulations to stop people who are not staff from working what if they were hurt there is a liability issue here i worked at a place where one of the warehouse workers brought his kid to work with him not for a visit but actually work alongside him they were both escorted off the premises
i ll give you a quarter to paint my fence the most fun you ll ever have
we both knew what we had to do whu not only is this an insane conclusion to come from noticing the restaurant you re at is short staffed but i can t imagine the corporation is cool with rando customers going in the back and working the deep frier or whatever
wtf it s a denny s not a homeless shelter why would you ever do this
as short staffed as my restruaunt is my manager would never allow a customer to work they gotta apply and train for minutes first d
that s a lie no restaurant would allow non employees to cook it s a legal liability nightmare
how it should have gone we saw they were short handed and we knew what we had to do find somewhere else to eat
i had a patient admitted to psych because he went to the back of a wendy s and started making his own burger lol
i once saw a video where a couple dozen people put on blue polo shirts and stood around in bestbuy they didn t do anything but if someone asked a question they would help them
never heard of it
what really happened customers complain about slow service overworked employee says they re short staffed customers say to hire more people employee tells them to fill out an application if they re so concerned customers call employee s bluff
i have nightmares like this
seriously what is this dribble and no i m not criticizing op
what s the subreddit about wrong narratives
lol row harder rice pudding eaters
stockholm syndrome
it wasn t even a question well that s your first problem you should have asked quite a few questions
no way this isn t a fake story
i actually noticed that kids in uganda were impoverished so i put on my cape and built a medical facility without any training and just started doing shit that i googled
local fastfood location allowed untrained women to come in off of the street and prepare food in other news mysterious wave of food poisening affects area
and then the manager on duty got fired for allowing people to work off the clock so dennys corporates ass is covered with the relevant labor board well done on getting someone fired so people could get their mid food a little faster
step into my kitchen when i m in the weeds and someone is catching a spatula upside the head
guess he ll be having fun doing that cleaning himself or paying a professional 10x that amount to do it some of these owners are so fucking stupid it shocks me that they can even have a functioning business with their incompetence
tell them that if they fire you then you will not come to work anymore
cleaning is difficult why would they underpay lol fucking idiots
ask him if he s seen all those now hiring nobody wants to work anymore signs up everywhere
this happened at a bar i worked at years ago enough of the workers complained and hr had to created a different job clock in so we got paid min wage during times we where not being tipped
ironically at the bar i recently left we got paid plus tips and i got fired for the same reason found a bar i have to drive an hour to but i make and work days a week and clear a grand worth it fuck that job my description says bartender not janitor hire someone for it
your part of cleaning the bar will consist of removing yourself from the premises how can they complain about that
go out with a bang and make the pours heavy
if you re w call the department of labor if you re call the irs then the department of labor x200b edit be sure to have this in writing email text etc of cleaning x hours at your normal rate
spring cleaning is a normal part of restaurant operation and i wish more restaurants made it a habit but being paid hr for being there doesn t seem legal since you can guarantee there will be no tips before quitting i would ask if you could be compensated for coming in with no expected tip revenue since that would guarantee you are working below federal minimum wage laws which would be illegal
i m not doing anything for hour i wouldn t spring clean a bar for hour
i have one thought if i ever owned a bar i would pay my people like an hour to come in and spring clean once a quarter i wouldn t make it mandatory but i am sure i would get people to show up also i would include lunch dinner my thought is that most people would do it and i will still save a couple bucks an hour vs hire out for random cleaners
i need a bartender in columbus ohio if you re interested
if you re not making tips for closed days and duties that you don t get tips you must be paid minimum wage so everyone go clean up the bar and do the work as prescribed and if they don t pay you all minimum wage then report them to the local labour department also bring in the union and then finally when you get a real nice job quit
nope not only are they required to pay at least minimum wage there are laws that say there is only a small percentage of your shift that they can have you do not serving duties
they legally can not have you do work like that for bartender wages you could sue them i worked at firebirds wood fire grill and they actually had to pay out their entire staff for lost wages because they were making them do non prep work for server wages
around here we call that a case of the old interview flu
fuck the cold be straight up honest tell them you have interviews and that the current pay is simply just not worth your time anymore if you re gonna get fired for not cleaning under minimum don t bother making an excuse to please them lol
the owner is expecting you to work for less than minimum wage which is per hour for non tipped employees in michigan the bar is closed so you can t earn tips and i doubt that the boss is going to give everyone a day s worht of tips out of his own pocket what does a labor law violation do to one s ability to hold a liquor license
the law requires him to pay minimum wage when tipped staff are doing work that isn t tipped work even a serve thar does something like rolling silverware must be paid at least federal min wage
you know what make sure you get it in writing text message will do then report him to everybody you can think of irs dol etc
it s illegal for you to work on those days at tipped wage pay if they don t pay you at least minimum wage for those house you have been illegally fired i advise you to show up demand the correct pay log everything that happens and then proceed if they don t pay you accordingly you got yourself a lawsuit to show in your bosses ass best of luck
not legal they have to pay you at least state minimum wage for work that you do that is not tipped
be sure to document exactly how dirty it is so osha can hear all about it next week and come visit
you should only get a tip wage if you do work that may result in tips if you re doing other work you should be paid at least minimum wage
congratulations this is an excellent example of how working people can do very well when they reach out to see what s out there rather than simply endure don t be afraid to pick up your labour and sell it to someone else when the market allows such as right now in many places bro
wouldn t you know it i think i feel a cold coming on oh no i hope you get better in time to start at you new job op
could be wrong but don t they have to pay you which is the michigan minimum wage if the business isn t open to public if someone can confirm this for me i d say find another job and then turn their ass into the department of labor
send him the numerous articles of people getting fined thousands and thousands of dollars for doing exactly what he s trying to do
i m no lawyer but i m pretty sure the minimum wage exemption for tips does not apply to work where no tips are involved if they fire you you could probably consult a labor attorney to fom
for non tipped work they are required by law to pay minimum wage in michigan that wage is per hour currently so by law they are required to pay you a minimum of per hour for both of those days work them if they don t you could see some nice wage theft damage reparations when you file a suit
im in michigan too what bar
i live in mi guessing you don t wanna share the bars name op i ve always wanted to leave a streaming pile of shit on a nice clean bar top
if they do fire you i would certainly say have a quick look at what your state says regarding food hygiene cleaning materials as some may require licences to use and the lack there off and who is better to serve revenge but a local bartender
hour you are being robbed stop subsidizing their loser lives
labor department your job is doing something extraordinary illegal
if you are pd below regular minimum wage as a tipped worker when you are doing non tipped work it has to be at regular minimum wage or higher
you re not doing tipped work at a minimum they better be paying you minimum wage
they will legally have to pay you minimum wage
where is john taffer
hr how do u afford anything
couple of things i ve learned from my current job never become that guy who takes care of everything but doesn t get paid like it it is completely fucking thankless and sooner or later you re just going to start taking the blame for everything that goes wrong because they take everything you get right for granted and secondly never work for an owner who s less responsible than you if you re putting in all the hard work and they act like they re constantly on vacation it s just a sign that they re dumping all their responsibility onto you and not paying you for it i used to like at first that my owner didn t care about little things it meant i could skip certain tasks now and again without worrying about a write up or anything like that then his attitude flipped and all of the sudden he s mad at me for not doing things that i used to do without being asked that i stopped doing because he told me to those types of people are just manchildren who somehow lucked into business ownership and keep succeeding because other people prop them up stop being one of those fools who does that
they can t pay you below the minimum wage when you are working as a non tipped employee six dollars an hour is legal when you re a tipped employee you are not a tipped employee when the restaurant is closed and you are scrubbing the walls
ten hours of work for before taxes what a great place
i don t know the laws where you are but where i am if you work a tipped position and are scheduled to work hours where you re not being tipped those hours must be paid at minimum wage again what they re doing could be totally legal where you are but many bars and restaurants don t like to work within the parameters of the law when it comes to wages if you haven t already check and see what the laws for your area are if you really feel like going out with a bang you should report them
what you should do is go in for an hour make a gigantic mess then text your boss saying you resign
not sure about michigan but in ohio a tipped employee cannot legally work longer than a consecutive half an hour on their tipped wage without actually making said tips they have to at least pay you minimum wage they need to be paying you an hourly wage for when you re not just bartending not only on cleaning days but any other time you are working and not tending source fellow bar manager who makes half her wages from tips
where do you work that an hour is even legal
i worked in the bar business for years and have been though this it sucks that some managers or owners get this thing in thier head that just because they need something others are obligated to help them out and do it the correct course of action is to hire professional cleaners who get paid to spring clean it s obvious making you all do it for an hour is cheaper i agree with you i think it s insulting and out of line there were many ways they could have played it to entice people to help out but they choose to do it the asshole way to act like you owe them days of manual labor for less than min wage i would probably do the same as you it s not just the money it s the realization that you work for assholes who think so little of you
i ve worked at almost every bar in my area i m a musician and most bar owners are the scum of the earth
completely illegal you need to make at least min wage on your shift you should report this
side work is acceptable but since a janitorial position is not part of your contract negotiate hourly pay for expert cleaning services hr
step show up step file complaint with local labour board since you are no longer being paid minimum wage step have all your coworkers also file complaints step step profit
nobody wants to work for hr x 10hrs x days to deep clean a crusty bar the owner of the bar probably who also does not want to work
i made an hour and cash under the table in the 70s
i once had to leave in the middle of a shift to go interview for a job eat my dick shitty job
report them to the better business bureau
sooo they aren t paying increased wage that s legit illegal
good that you re standing up for yourself too many people just lie down and take it while saying i m just grateful i have a job hour for a deep restaurant cleaning is slavery
fuck that only happens bc we let it happen don t let it be ok
my dad owned a small bar in michigan and was the best owner ever he worked hours a week up until the month he passed he ended up giving the bar completely over to the main bartender manager who helped him during his chemo treatments she was awesome and the family was all about gifting her the bar we were never rich but the bills were always paid and people that worked there were happy and paid well it s possible to not be a shitty employer and pay good wages is what i m tryna to say and i m sorry that you have to deal with this shit
pretty sure this is a serious employment violation that you could go after them for may be worth talking to a lawyer and documenting everything since you are clearly in a tiped position but being expected to do the work of a nontipped employee it ll entirely depend on michigan employment law but it s still worth seeking some legal counsel to see if you have a case
i ve got a story like this i used to sell cars at a very successful dealership cars a day were sold out of this place we had a snowstorm on a sunday we were closed on sunday and there was about feet of snow in our parking lot monday whoever could actually make it to work me jeep wrangler were today to go shovel the parking lot so we could make money i worked on commission there was no such thing as an hourly rate even the worst salespeople would bring him 3k a month i sat my ass in a chair and watched other people shovel you won t pay me for doing something that isnt my job i will not be working every single person that day made zero dollars but the dealership got the parking lot shoveled not one manager was helping either
the thought of cleaning a bar for hours and only receiving is so damn repulsive
can you dm me the bar i get if you don t want to post it here publicly but i m curious
i took over managing a small bar when they fired the old manager who admittedly should have been fired i upped sales got people coming in and staying in organized pool competitions got a jager and fireball shot machines for free bc of how much we sold and made a lot in tips there were only bartenders oli worked nights and a day the only shift that changed when i took the manager spot was the day shift that v i picked up so no one was getting shitty shifts so i could make money well the manager of the other tiny bar and friend of the owner got jealous i m guessing and took over both bars hired his fuck buddy and gave her my shifts and other good shift and gave me all the slow nights after a week my nights weren t slow anymore but those good shifts were falling off the fuckbuddy bartender started coming in late to relieve me and the manager wouldn t even respond to texts on mother s day after she was hours late and hadn t responded to any messages amd the manager hadn t either i just closed the place and left texted the owner and let him know it was up to him how they handled that no surprise both bars closed within months and the owner is working at a grocery store now some people just can t get out their own way what sucks is the owner was a generally nice guy that i got along with he just let the wrong person run his business
hi all first and foremost i want to say thank you for all of the encouragement i am blown away i wanted to give an update since so many people have asked i am still waiting to hear back from a couple really good interviews however i have accepted a position that reached out to me last night out of the blue a well known very high end restaurant has offered me plus tips to be their floor manager bartender man if you re reading this and you have a shitty job download indeed and get a better one don t just take that shit because you feel like you have to everyone is hiring and plenty are paying very fair wages
son of a cough
woah good for you op
never fucking been a better time to be a bartender for real
let them fire you and you can get edd
good for you gl on your new job hope it is better then the last one
damn that s a shame they could have given you all a nice bonus to compensate you for your time and effort their loss good luck to you
i wouldn t stick around long enough to get paid that hr and then see if you can sue them for not paying you fair wages depending on where you live
i hope you report this to the labor board
i don t know if it s the same in every state but in massachusetts if you are exempt from being paid minimum wage because you earn tips and you don t make minimum wage with base pay plus tips during any shift then they must pay you three difference so if he bars closed and you re not earning any tips they would need to pay you minimum wage for those days if you re state is the same then just work them contact the department of labor afterwards then if they for you then you have a retaliation suit edit just read another comment that it s federal law so i say written the hours then fuck then by going to the law man
sounds like it s time for you to open a better bar across the street hoss
let him try firing you for not working for below minimum wage and lets see how the department of labour views the unlawful termination
all the power and opportunity to you my friend that s almost like someone spit in your face
ahh i can t be in on tuesday i m gonna have a cold
pretty sure if you are doing work that doesn t involve tips they have to pay at least minimum wage which i m sure in mi is more then or federal rate
there is no way i would clean for an hour my brother and my friend s mom used to pay me an hour cash to clean their houses and that was more than years ago i would say i m not a maid service you better pay at least an hour to clean the place or i m staying home get it in writing too
i worked a cool bar gig once where we closed for a remodel staff had the option of getting hired on as construction crew for an hour this was at a time when that was pretty sweet but we weren t required to do it it was just to keep people from finding new gigs during the slow winter months
i desire an update in a few day s time i wanna see how they react
isn t it illegal to pay you under minimum wage if you re performing non tipped work not saying you should do it for either but you could try making a complaint somewhere if you want to make anything of it
regardless of how fucking stupid your owner is for asking or expecting this participation i d get him to email me the details and go in to do it the first day second day inquire why you weren t paid actual minimum wage for untipped hours over a half hour worked without an opportunity to be tipped the law then contact a labor law attorney who would probably love the opportunity to help you or others be compensated for other instances of the same practice
that is why every profession without exception needs a functioning union i am not saying dont misunderstand me that a bar with employees should form a union of two you should anyways but bar tenders waitresses and so on all together should form one union as the workers council for example in germany
ppl just dont wanna work anymore but nah fr six hundred pennies per minutes of work sounds like some temp service or halfway house wage or years ago lmmfao man ima be real w you they are paying you like a dope fiend in fact you could probably make a bigger net pay from selling blood plasma or jagging off into a cup to sell genetics
depending on your state they are legally compelled to pay you the difference if tips do not balance out to your state s minimum wage so even if you decide to go in you should check on that
go onto the server subreddits and go find that federal law that states if you re not doing work for tips like sidework for more than minutes iirc then they have to pay you minimum wage which is minimum wherever you are print it out and bring it to your manager email it to him too if he fires you then it s retaliation and you have a paper trail
how can they legally have you work for under minimum wage without tips for those two days
spread the word that this place hasn t been cleaned and won t pay minimum wage for untipped work no point in making it easy for him to find replacements
isnt the federal minimum wage at
tell me what bar and if ever been there i won t ever go back if i haven t i ll avoid it
angles in oklahoma city does the same stuff their owners live in the richest neighborhood in the city yet pay tipped wages even for cleaning
show up and just don t do anything fake being busy the whole time fuck them
isn t an hour below federal min wage
go in say hi then leave you came in you wiped your feet on the way in cleaning achieved
another strategy would be to take this the legal route it s one thing to give you server wages when you re actually serving it s another thing when they re asking you to do other responsibilities then you should be getting at least minimum wage tell them it s not legal and put fear in them if you are resigned to loose this job anyway at least go out fighting for the others
i ve been through michigan a couple times over the past year and the amount of help wanted signs i saw was astounding i m sure they re all pretty shitty pay but your boss is a fool if they think there s a glut of workers
how do you professionally say i m not coming in on my day off to work
corporate life requires the skills of a courtier in renaissance italy deception flattery intrigue hypersensitivity to fashions and trends
corporate speak has its place but i much prefer direct communication might be why i haven t been promoted in the last couple years stuffed shirts hate being told exactly what the situation is
toodaloo
there s already a website for this https://howtoprofessionallysay.akashrajpurohit.com/
of communicating with people in corporate america is coming up with phrasing that is perfectly passive aggressive but with enough polite deniability that it would be inappropriate for someone to respond in kind
this corporate lingo really makes my blood boil
i like the blue collar trades versions of these replies better
fuck you and the horse you rode in on slightly less professional but significantly more satisfying
i ve just added these to my work scripts for those of us that need a bit of help with empowering responses like these these are gold more please if anyone has any other succinct and professional responses like this please share
this should be part of the school curriculum having tact is vital to survive in the workplace
i ll try to have a look at it this week some time when i m unoccupied i m pretty sure that i know what i m talking about but thanks anyway damn that sucks
i love her videos such a master of snark but assertively establishing your boundaries at work a lot of her content really is about us making ourselves a priority and not slaves to our work
the whole your poor planning does not make it my emergency has been hitting different this week
i need her as a translation app for work
yeah no problem i ll handle that first thing in the morning i would never tell someone to stay in their lane that is just a dumb question if you are afraid of other viewpoints you are incompetent damn good luck with that let me know if you need a hand
typed the responses for those who wanted to write them down mg worn day concludes at five but i ll prioritize that first thing tomorrow thanks for your input i ll keep that in mind i understand that falls in your scope of responsibility but ill support where it will make sense
jesus christ no thanks
alotta ways to say get fucked
noted
additional considerations when using these some things have to be done now regardless of how elegantly you told somebody off the scope of your responsibilities are determined by your supervisor be prepared to defend your decisions if someone wants to make issue you will actually need to consider where your support makes sense just because i ve heard these dropped before like somehow that was the end of the conversation
i love these my sister was always good at telling me how to say what i wanted to get across without foaming at the mouth first step is to wait until you re not gobsmacked and angry at the offender s request management in my prior career admin now i remind myself every day to smile and nod and appear to be in total agreement and then do what i am supposed to under my job description and people please remember your receptionist can be your best friend your client will never know you forgot the meeting because reception can and will happily invent an alternative reason to cover your butt disrespect gets you basic email messages especially if you cannot be bothered to even set up your voicemail be in your office or tell us where you are if you are not there and quit expecting me to wash your damn dishes seriously eta the usual
i see some people claiming this is too respectful when it s really the opposite this intentionally dishonest cultural office jargon is the weapon owners and their bootlicking supervisors use to be cruel manipulative and greedy with a smile to their workers it is a tool of propaganda used on workers they don t respect and falsely consider too ignorant to recognize it is pretty much the ultimate fuck you short of quitting to turn the owner s own tools of manipulation against them i ve done it it usually shocks them and forces them to leave with a look of concern and regroup with their tail between their legs also much like a school yard bully it makes them leave you alone to pursue more easily intimidated prey to get their fragile ego s superiority fix
i just call this playing the game
my response to the first one clocking out
this way of speaking is borderline sociopathic to me who the fuck actually talks like this
is this a real thing like is this really a show i could watch because those were so good i feel like if i just practiced responses like this i would be dropping them at work every week now i wouldn t actually say the first statement but i know i wouldn t come up with the professional way of saying it on the spot
loving all these edgelords in the comments here pretending that they tell people to fuck off at work when we all know they do no such thing you re probably actually the ones that lick the boss s boots and tattle when your co workers come in minutes late
every one of these useless idiots is wearing an outfit that costs more than you make in a month and this is what they bring to the world
i prefer to just tell people to fuck off
just tell them if your employer fires you for being too direct i feel like it s more of a blessing then a curse go on unemployment and find somewhere that doesn t suck ass
they seem easily pleased
corporate speak is such bullshit waste of time and only for those who cannot talk cohesively and eruditely
why is everyone so happy saying things professionally isn t nearly as rewarding and saying fuck off greg last time you ran the project you got all weird because your neighbor was banging your wife and your kids fucking hate you so that s things you fucked up this project your marriage and your children s love for their father just sit the fck down greg
this video made me want to blow my fucking head off my body
removed
how about i don t make any more money dealing with your bullshit so you gotta figure it out yourself
who is she she s pretty
this is how i do respond to those kinds of questions no one is going to die if i don t respond to the client until tomorrow morning i am going home to order pizza and drink a beer no one asked you for your opinion gary
how about you learn to speak in a mature adult fashion instead of using fucking social media speak
that s how the pay gap happened
i feel like i lost iq points being exposed to this pap
if you say my works end at you sound like a crazy person just say you have to leave and go making a bold proclamation looks way less professional
who is the woman they are interviewing
u savevideo
this shit reprehensible
at one point someone got it into their head that staying after was mandatory i always tell people that employment is voluntary you don t have to do anything some things will get you fired some things won t a manager can t make you work after hours if he files a complaint with hr he has to explain why the work needs to be done outside of office hours not why you are not available after
you were the chosen one you were supposed to destroy the corporate speak not join it
this works at places where no work gets done large corporations etc this doesn t work in real workplaces hats off to this lady though
excellent responses
i follow her on youtube her sketches are hilarious
how do you say im reassigning this back to you because it s not my job to fix your fuckups or i don t have have to explain myself to you because you have no fucking authority over me in this company
instead of get your dickbeaters off my shit fuck knuckle try something i can help you with ted
capitalism forces you to become a passive aggressive twat for hrs a week
i ve declined meetings because i would not be able to provide valuable input to the topic being discussed this to a former manager who only attends meetings and puts tasks on everyone else even if it fell way out of your job responsibility now i just avoid the meetings altogether and she can t say a damned thing because my current boss has my back see you next tuesday bitch
it s depressing she thought that she was being sassy by saying thanks for your input i ll keep that in mind women have been so beaten down by the patriarchy even saying thank you i ll think about that is seen as sassy jfc
toodle oo
i like this gal good idea but makes her point
damn i guess she s a expert professional
why do we have to do this
no
probably similar to the staying late one my workdays are m f but i would be happy to prioritize this first thing on monday morning or i have plans this weekend that are not rearrangeable but i am happy to prioritize this first thing monday morning or if it is a text outside work hours ignore text
i would be glad to assist you however i am currently travelling outside of your country if boss is asking you to come on your day off before it has happened i would be glad to assist you however my ridiculous expense which i have reserved for that day will have to be refunded do not hesitate to forge a receipt or bill
by not answering your phone
never answer bro
hahahaha
don t take calls and ignore messages from your employer unless being payed for that and if it s your boss telling it a day before sorry i have my day off and i really need the rest to be fully prepared for my next work day also in my country overtime means more pay based on your average income unless they offer you to take that free time as a time off saturday and sunday is more iirc afternoon shift is and night shift is more days ot and time shifting stacks so if you go ot on a night shift beginning on a saturday you get them monies so in here people like to avoid this as it means paying more oh and if they ask you to go to work during a public holyday you get double of your normal hourly rate
piss off sir and have a pleasant and wonderful day
unfortunately i am unable to work that day but i am happy to prioritize that on day you re back or i will make sure to prioritize that never tell them exact plans in case they decide to argue that your job is more important than x or something like that it s none of their business
you don t answer the phone unless paid to be on call
those aren t too bad in renaissance england it was just incest
genuinely curious but fashion
jesus fuck you are right i hadn t made this connection but this is exactly what it is i ve been around it my whole life so i can usually step into it when necessary the older i get the grosser it feels every time i have to
i mean some of this has more to do with being polite i got a real problem with lawyers at my job giving us ux ui advice i work as a mobile and web dev so the stay in your lane is common one for me rather than say stay in your lane which is rude i usually actually take the time to explain my ux reasoning or i say okay we ll have to think about that or we ll look into that either they get bored from my long winded explanations and lose interest or they drop it if i tell them i listened and need to take time to think not always as a brush off sometimes i do think about it but being direct is not always the opposite of corporate talk i feel like you can do both as long as you are polite and make them feel like they have been heard
best piece of management advice or inter group interaction advice your choice i ever got was from a former group leader who explained that people need to have their say even if you think they re idiots oftentimes it s just best to listen nod your head and say thanks we ll take that under advisement rather than detailing all of the reasons why they re idiots or just flat out telling them they re idiots otherwise if you actually do need them to do something for you or to listen to you you ve literally just poisoned that relationship
as i was watching this i was thinking if your approach to professional communication is to use coded language to sass other people you re not going to get the result you want unless of course the result you want is to be ostracized and hated around the office i m not saying you should let people walk all over you but if someone is constantly asking you to stay late but you re not comfortable with it that deserves a genuine conversation not some coded fuck you i m going home eventually they re going to fire you regardless of how tarted up your corporate speak is
this the last place i worked had an official corporate policy of straight talk get right to the point and don t beat around the bush i think the real intention was to facilitate communication across multinational teams where some groups might be more inclined potentially due to cultural reasons to wander forever without ever actually making a point i liked to use it as my justification for bringing up obvious shit that everyone else was avoiding sometimes the thing just needs to be said and i didn t care enough about my image to be afraid to just say the dang thing
i m with you i prefer stay in your lane or that s a you problem to what they were throwing out in the video i have exactly no time for office politics or bullshit say what you mean tell me what you want and let me go on about my day this coded office lingo is tantamount to going to the south and hearing well bless your heart
she s the best
toodle fucking oo
i had no idea she had a website links to her tiktok as well where i usually see her skits
that s her website
why
it s not just fucked it s proper fucked and it s gonna cost to unfuck
fuck off i ll talk to ya at my break stop fuckin bothering me right now
so is selling your soul if you want to work on a place where you have to beat around the bush
let s circle back and discuss this when we have more bandwidth
unless you re the boss in which case you can be as much of an asshole as you want because you re paying the bills
it moist certainly is good content
teaching people how to hold their ground in a setting that is designed to take advantage of them is a worthy thing to bring to the world
arguing that pre changed sentences are actually better communications is actually kinda cool lingo is language
workplace harassment being direct
here s the thing not everybody is a teenager who would be satisfied or would be keeping their job after being an edgelord to their coworkers
removed
yeah i like some of her content but my workday ends at is unnecessarily snippy and doesn t make you look like someone who enforces appropriate boundaries it makes you look like someone who s out the door at no matter what s happening and if that s what you want to be known for no problem some people want need that but if you want to be known as someone who is not a pushover and will work a bit of overtime only when they think the situation calls for it you might say something like i m afraid i can t stay late tonight but i ll take care of that first thing in the morning translates to i work late when i choose but you and your problem are not something i choose
i disagree this kind of verbage takes the a type boot lickers off guard because they consider professional jargon that intentionally obfuscates truth as their domain they see it as part of their power and gives reinforces their own belief in their superiority over the workers they outrank look at almost every text exchange between manager and employer in this subreddit this is the same rhetorical venom owners and supervisors use every day i ve used similar tactics to this video and it stops a type boot lickers in their tracks more than anything they like to believe that the office jargon is their cudgel to manipulate staff it tends to shock them when that cannon of disingenuous manipulation is turned on them

my apologies but i m unavailable
the 1st one because it makes it clear i am never going to work outside of my workdays the 2nd suggests they can ask this next week don t leave them that opening they will take it
competitive wages means your pay competes with your bills
i don t apply to jobs that don t list the pay
yeah it s funny in the military everything is public from private to star general every special pay combat pay bah etc you know what we also have the oldest crustiest star generals making 10x what a private with less than month tis bas pay only so in comparison that is a to ratio for the ceo to the lowest new guy yes if you had all the special pays and a super high bah etc it could be to ok let s say it s the max in the civilian world is to for the average worker not even the lowest so the median us income is both numbers that means in the average ceo took home maybe just maybe being public about wages solves some problems cuz i know generals and those boys make real life and death decisions yes there are back benchers but i don t see ceos out there doing real work hours a week with human lives on the line i work with some ceos and if they are working hours a week that s a lot
they don t want current employees to see them offering more money to new people
because the pay isn t actually competitive they don t want people who are financially motivated
i get contacted by recruiters all the time and of the time the pay is not listed my response is always please do not contact me with job listings that do not include compensation information about half of the time they respond with the comp and it s usually laughable
california and colorodo now require job listings to have the pay range i remember when colorodo adopted this many companies just made job listings or didn t allow people from colorodo to apply
competitive wages means it s the minimum we can get away with
i actually heard close to a reasonable answer from a recruiter recently about this question though i am not sure if it applies commonly if you post a high salary range you get significantly more applicants but the range of skills and experience of the pool of applicants is much more variable meaning that you have to filter through more people to find a person that will actually be good for the job also most everyone will want the high end of the salary range and will be insulted if they are offered less from the employers perspective by not posting any salary range the pool of people that apply to it will be smaller but the skills and experience will be closer to the requirements of the job than a random person who applied because they saw that it offered more than other jobs they were looking at and the ideal candidate will already know or at least have an idea of what the job will pay so when the salary negotiation begins both sides have limited information but they also know their own limits the applicant knows the lowest they would be willing to accept and they know what they are hoping to receive the employer knows the highest they are willing to offer and they also know how low they would like to offer the recruiter also said and i d actually heard this before that the ideal situation is when a person comes in and requests an amount at the middle of the range they hope to offer and then they can offer a bit more even if it is still within the boundaries of the ideal range to sweeten the deal for example the budget for the hire 80k the predicted range 55k 75k the applicant request 63k the offer made 68k still under budget that all said the types of jobs we were talking about were fairly specific types of jobs but i could imagine that this is part of the reasoning for why this is so common companies want to pay you as little as possible but companies at least some companies the less stupid ones at least also recognize that in order for their system to operate they need to have people when companies advertise a really high wage it might be more a sign of desperation rather than an indication that the place will be a good employer this is one of the reasons why i think in general people should be more open about what they get paid as it disperses pretty important information
everywhere that says competitive just means minimum wage lol
a job without a pay amount of scale isn t even worth the seconds it takes to scroll past if you weren t completely embarrassed by what you were offering you d have no problem putting it
just remember the pricks who use competitive instead of giving the actual salary or salary range are the same people who will reject your application for being too vague or basically saying nothing if you don t have metrics or numbers in your resume and also that competitive just means around the regional average mmm i love me a slightly better than average salary
it took me a while to realize that competitive is corporate speak for indexed to the market median but the question is how is it indexed pay that is indexed to market median is very different from pay that is indexed to of median versus pay that is indexed to of median and some companies will say they pay of market which sounds like 85th percentile it s not it s of the 50th percentile competitive does mean that your pay will move up or down with the market but it says nothing about how your pay will relate to the market without knowing that index that the company uses
company it s weird we can t hire anyone me are we taking the average rate for a given position for our area and beating it by at least company no we re competitive though me so we re tied at best is what you re saying more likely we re trying to sell a functional loss to new hires so literally we offer no concrete incentives for joining our company company but the culture we re a family don t they want a family why do you hate your family
well every job field tends to have a rough pay band i work in the aviation industry a hour is the going rate depending on experience and some other factors
good rule of thumb if they are evasive its shit
and all jobs i have applied for i am qualified for but keep running into the we are looking at more qualified candidates thought you needed people in the labor force pay sucks job hunting sucks etc
capitalism fails wherever its tried
because it s negotiable
it s a race to the bottom
because they want to keep paying current employees less
because they didn t specify what they re competing for it s not to see who can pay the most
maybe it means their pay is so low that they re competitive
amazon has a channel in slack where you can anon post your pay
they re competing with other businesses to see who can get away with offering the lowest pay
i applied at stop and shop i got an interview they avoided how much they would pay and i played along they called me and said i got the job i said great how much is the pay they said minimum wage i said i m getting too old to live off minimum wage they just said sorry we can t negotiate meanwhile stop and shop has signs all over the store promoting competitive pay the speakers even announce how great the pay and working for stop and shop is i joke with my buddies that stop and shop doesn t negotiate with terrorists
i strongly believe in sharing your wage with coworkers to try to level the playing field but i have realized it causes extreme bitterness in people that realize they re being under paid but don t have the backbone to demand a raise i m an electrician and my foreman supervisor takes on the immense responsibilities of running super high end jobs for only an hour more than myself after discussing our wages together he still hasn t advocated for himself and instead looks at me like i m some over paid asshole he was making backhanded comments about my work the other day and i just had to break it to him that it s not my fault i can negotiate for myself and get paid well it s his fault that he can t sad days
there s some good news on this front a bunch of states made posting salary on job ads a requirement starting january this year it s mainly democrat held states it wouldn t have happened if the democrats weren t made to capitulate and run on progressive platforms rather than the normal liberal nothing platforms you can thank yourselves for that because they all know what anti work is and they re scared of you so does mainstream media and they re scared as well
when you see a job advert on social media gently remind them that posting an actual pay range is now proper etiquette
i m in the uk and have a friend who works in recruitment she has said that employers who don t post salaries often complain about lack of or under qualified applicants she does say in reply to them that due to no salaries being listed the people they would like to hire aren t applying which is true if i m ever looking for a new job whilst currently working i want to make sure that i am leaving for more money if i don t know how much then why would i waste my time
don t worry the current system won t last much longer
i hate that this is true
whenever i read that phrase i think competing with other firms for the lowest possible pay
i go a step further and report the post as misleading
this is the way
ceos work hard during those lunches and suppers and cocktails where they entertain potential customers or simply making connections or playing golf to make connections then at their hardest deciding what percentage of the workforce to fire in order to reduce cost and maximize profits so they can hit their productivity goals and earn fat bonuses
i worked at a state university for a couple years low level low paying job my income was public record as was my boss and their boss and their boss
or citibank pay range listing from to million when nyc implemented the pay transparency last november
so has every other socioeconomic system humans have come up with
yeah a year ago i went to for a welding job building and welding out grainery parts they worked hours a week built off blue prints my decade of welding and degrees got me an offer of an hour
why is it the way it s one way but it s not the way
sir as the kids say your sarcasm slaps
we have not tried socialism yet some dictatorships and social democracies but not socialism yet
then why felate capitalism like it s something special it s time to move on from this failure
because humans are the weak link we re by nature greedy fucks that will climb over bodies to get what we want you could design the perfect system and greed would find a way to ruin it the worst part is those of us that are not greedy just get stepped on by the greedy ones and they keep on doing it
jeez i have worked in a grocery store for years head of the deli produce manager floral department and even learned the registers they just said we love all that and we hope you change your mind and call us back
they have the right idea
socialism won t work until we can find a way to remove the tendency of some people to take the power inherently given to the government in a socialist society and twist it to their personal gain
at least not on the scale of globally interconnected states
to what i d be interested in an alternative viable system
nah
i agree we should def try mixing the two first stop giving big corps tax breaks and free money and creating competing agencies first
how about a mix of socialism and capitalism where the government instead of giving subsidies grants or any tax breaks starts a competing company start with insurance internet and power i d wager if given the choice of a government insurance to have the money be taken out similar to insurance and medicare but have all health are costs be covered and required to be taken everywhere they would pick the gov option
i never offer solutions to someone who can t see the problems why answer questions you re not really asking
i never offer solutions to someone who can t see the problems why answer questions you re not really asking you guys should really move away from capitalism and into some other system i refuse to name or give any specifics about like what the pay from that job ad in op my economic system is so competitive i don t even need to tell you what it is
i am really asking and i am really asking because i don t currently have an idea of how this would work really interested if you have any to contribute
what a bullshit cop out i never accept solutions from those who are more interested in gaining clout or power based on hoarding information that they likely don t even have why answer questions you re being directly asked
why should i answer a question you never sincerely ask i m treating you like an adult i m not here to spoon feed you
my grandpa only got hr with his master s degree in i don t know why you re complaining
why do you think you were encouraged to take on all this college debt now you can t not work drowning in debt perpetually on the hampster wheel best way to create indentured servants
the reality of the situation is that not one single person with a master s degree would apply for that job i would hope so at least
i would laugh in their face if i had a masters and they offered that pay
what s the masters degree in i m looking at emails for an advanced diploma that s paying hr but that s a chemical engineering technician
i saw a lead administrative assistant position in atlanta on indeed today for an hour madness
late april fools got em
i did just two years at a private school for just a ba and my loan repayments were nearly a month one job i had was in health care sector and they would pay the employees every check to not use their health insurance if you aren t living at home still on the parents insurance there s just no way was half my fucking salary oh and this was with like in grant money off the top too lol i almost cry when i think of those who did years and come out owing maybe
requirements years experience with windows
another company playing with h1b visas but but we can t find a suitable candidate with a master s degree first when did earning a master s degree in another country qualify you for a job here did you test such a person i know that doctors and lawyers are routinely tested if they did not get their education in the state i guess we trust offshore engineers even in high security government jobs
shocking really
they mistyped i m sure
why do people still go to college go into a trade you make damn near much as a college grad no corporate bs your outside get a company truck and you become handy
i make around an hour without a degree as a manager for a trash company the company isn t trash our employees work in garbage collection i started driving a box truck in upgraded my license to a class a cdl and drove otr for a couple of years then landed a local driving job in the teamsters union driving paid great but i hurt my back in non work related and had to get off of the road i d racked up over a million safe driving miles i d already helped management with logistics routing new customers doing an area wide reroute to gain efficiency etc so they moved me across the state and promoted me to transportation manager from there i kept hustling learned and mastered my craft learned the ins and outs of each role i was placed into and never fell complacent here i am 110k yr company paid gas card for all fuel purchases month car allowance annual bonus based on site performance hustle don t get complacent if your job winds up as a dead end find another get the right type of experience on your rsum to be able to move up or out negotiate your pay don t accept mediocrity from yourself don t accept a company doing shady shit and blow the whistle when you need to document everything build a network of likeminded individuals in similar roles in your industry linkedin
you know i prefer a million dollars a year pay but i ll happily take 250k pay same rule applies just because preferred is listed doesn t mean that s required hell if it s not a speciality job just because a degree is listed as required does not mean it s required this is as stupid as them listing it as preferred
the rent
it says preferred not required they can prefer anything they want and you as the applicant have the final say apply interview well make them want you than near the end negotiate your salary not sure why people always assume you will get paid what is posted those numbers are meaningless always save salary negotiation for the end once you make them go through the whole process they are less likely to reject you
lack of a time machine
granpa didnt need a masters in either
absolutely correct it also helps to further stratification of society when the children of people who were unable to afford or couldn t complete higher education are subsequently also unable to afford higher education what an excellent way to ensure those diminishing menial labor positions will have plenty of people competing so they can be further exploited with even lower stagnant pay it seems exactly criminal how these social constructs are set up
why do people cry about student load debt do people not do any basic research before they sign papers research the estimated full cost of getting your desired degree research the types of jobs and their pay with that degree if the numbers make sense go for it if not don t takes like five minutes are people truly this lazy if you are this lazy than its all your fault here ill give you my numbers bs in computer science at my local nobody knows about university of tuition in four years jobs i can get in that degree full stack developer 70k 150k product manager 60k 150k database administrator 60k 140k web developer 50k 110k systems analyst 40k 110k software tester 40k 70k information security analyst business analyst 51k 110k user interface designer 63k 140k outside of software testing they all make sense go for it but if your expected degree will cost you 40k and your average earning will be 50k and you are dumb enough to agree to it than who s fault is that besides you take some damn responsibility for your actions
maybe they re hoping to capitalist the people from silicon valley who lost their jobs recently after billionaire shareholders needed more record profits
but keep in mind that this is an hr position that they re staffing
setup an interview and just laugh whenever they say anything lmao that s genius
probably some kind of business degree based on the microsoft requirement but they didn t bother to say another reason this listing is insulting it might even be a listing to make people think the company is doing better than they are fake listings for social credit are a thing they don t actually want to hire anyone but it wastes everyone else s time
that is clearly enough to afford a used car from to sleep in and a gym membership if its good enough for america s to year old retirees its good enough for executive administrative assistants note retirees having to live in cars not hyperbole actual seniors living in actual cars not actually guaranteed any particular quality of life or even life other limitations may apply offer not valid within certain city limits or near any mansions for more details see below https://youtu.be/foogch5mrqq
was the april fool the employer who was serious or the person who took the position
the struggle is real
years anticipating manager s mistakes and taking responsibility for them preferred
especially if they re from the ccp and almost certainly not there to spy steal technology or influence someone with sexy time favors
the income gap continues to grow pushed forward by greed beyond any trace of humanity
if only but even then do you want to work for an employer who doesn t post a salary range and also has typos in their offer
while wearing flannel strapping on boots and picking up a wrench is a stereotype some women embrace it isn t for everyone my limited history of construction work and work in it should not be considered validation just because of my sexual orientation it was interesting work and paid for ramen during college but even with those trades the pay was extremely variable
shunning poorly behaved employers and calling out poor treatment isn t listed but everything you did list is great using the bad employers as practice for interviews can make them at least minimally useful
this is an employer trying desperately to low ball for whatever position if they were serious about getting a masters graduate they would have listed a salary range tearing this ridiculous advertisement down for its obvious condescension and insipid bias is appropriate quit tolerating and being an apologist for poor and outright exploitative behavior from employers or you will encourage more of it
then they lied in their posting and as liars they can never respect you apply lie your ass off practice interviewing this is your payoff make them drool about you negotiate without compromise and then leave after telling them lying is bad
children of the very wealthy don t have this problem but for the rest you have the uneducated undereducated ready to fill out the min wage service jobs and you have the educated ready to fill out the lower middle management jobs balancing the columns whatever all desperately needing to work due to debt the majority are just grist for the mill
through the 90s most of the nobody knows about universities were pretty well subsidized by the states and or tuition kept down so that a year was quite affordable even the expensive universities were not nearly as expensive as they ve become there s also a lot less assistance out there in the form of pell grants and the gov t guaranteed stafford loans so we ve seen tuition costs explode and much less assistance and or subsidies out there previous generations simply didn t incur nearly as much debt on a relative basis for higher education that leaves students taking out big loans i am not personally aggrieved but i still think a lot of people are getting a very raw deal
when companies downsize hr people get released too
be water my friend
when i say trades i think you are thinking of the typical ones look into controls technician non destructive inspection crane operator hazardous waste transportation all i m sayin is there are tons of trades that pay very very well i m in one
holding under performers accountable is crucial to your own development and the betterment of the business but to your point accountability and shunning are two different things never put someone on blast never embarrass an employee in front of others never call out their poor behavior in a public setting again though holding individuals accountable for their performance or behavior is absolutely necessary and should only be done behind closed doors if i m holding a driver huddle talking about a policy procedure or best practice and someone disagrees that s fine as long as it s delivered respectfully i don t mind being challenged in a public setting but the moment the employee becomes belligerent unprofessional or disrespectful i ll invite that employee to a private discussion after the meeting with everyone well billy you bring some interesting questions insight to the topic and i d be happy to discuss one on one after the huddle listening to your peers and employees is the single most important thing you can do if someone brings me a complaint i ask them how they can help first then ask how i can help the situation same thing if i m having a low performance discussion with someone i already know what changes adjustments they need to make to better produce but i put it on them what do you think you can do to improve your efficiency
quit being an idiot and thinking this is what you need to have to apply you don t get what you don t ask for so it goes both ways
good thing it isn t sustainable either an inevitable social collapse will occur with all the additional suffering that brings or people will get so disgusted and angry that headhunting billionaires will become a popular sport maybe both will happen its happened before
wut
almost no one holds employers accountable employees get the blame almost always shunning is effective it prevents the bad employer from mistreating people there is no identifying info in this post so no one is on blast just the behavior which is absolutely blast worthy but i will and have told poor employers at the end of a practice interview or interviews where they could improve and why they should that again is a closed setting between myself and whomever is conducting the interview
and have some fucking fun if your job isn t enjoyable fucking leave but always keep in mind the ebbs and flows of a workplace you ll always have rough patches be certain that it isn t going to get any better before making a rash decision
obviously anyone can apply for any position the fact they listed it in the manner they listed it is the problem that you keep missing that point is just sad
headhunting billionaires will become a popular sport i d join that for legal reasons that is a joke
it has but we ve also been re programmed to have the attention span of a fruit fly handed smartphones hulu netflix reality tv all for a monthly fee and keep everyone glued to what doesn t matter
bruce lee
that s what i meant when i said don t accept shady shit and document every
for another point sometimes the most effective way to combat a bad employer is to put their behavior on blast publicly shaming a company can cost them money which is a very effective way to punish poor and unacceptable behavior just as employers consider it appropriate to terminate employees work isn t called work because it s fun that is what play is for if work is enjoyable and fulfilling it s a rare bonus for most people
hey don t like it don t apply my point is far too many people pass on opportunities because they aren t qualified when in reality if they applied they could still get the job i really with this sub would stop popping up under popular i end up arguing with idiots all day
the taxidermy would be hilarious
true but modern bread and circuses can only go so far failing infrastructure inflation driving people to cut costs rising medical expenses whether directly billed or thru taxation from the toxic dietary recommendations of the american dietetics association read shill for processed foods and 7th day adventist religious dogma plus a lack of births putting strain on retirement plans all add up to a nice stew of starvation pestilence and civil unrest viva la revolution more on 7th day lies and murder by food agenda https://youtu.be/vq5sjd4t7co
bruce was being deep good for bruce
your ideology and mine don t have many points of difference your advise is apropos for most situations and was well explained i appreciate your participation and investment in helping the community
employer definitely employee never
it appears you ve missed more than one point the job posting is poorly constructed and insultingly low that was the original problem being addressed not applying is the quickest and for most people the correct action using the interview for practice is another option actually working for that employer is probably a horrible idea given their obvious failings from the listing to your other point it isn t that people don t feel qualified it s that they are qualified but want to be compensated appropriately for their work this is a common theme to many of the posts here as systemic income inequality imbalance and outright wage slavery are so pervasive rather than mocking people for their posts maybe try reading a bit more about social economics and some of the various crises being caused by badly regulated capitalism
tbf with how much plastic surgery most of them have had the taxidermist s job is already done
i try to be careful with my pronouns
i was agreeing wholeheartedly
i know great minds and other self congratulatory ego stroking for both us lol
i would document everything file an eeoc complaint as soon as you file a formal complaint with hr you need dates times and what was said it s a long hard road to fight for what is right but you absolutely can make their life a living hell
hr is not your friend hr is not there to help you hr only serves the purpose of protecting the bosses never ever forget that
i had a boss like this once he owned the small company seemed nice enough during the interviews but then the job was miserable because of him openly racist disgustingly sexist he referred to women as c nts and said he hired one once never again and the worst micromanager i d ever worked with he would come running out of his office to tell me to get off the phone and call the person back once i d figured out the issue and he would stand behind me and angrily say things like don t use the mouse use the keyboard shortcut it s faster i lasted a couple months and just bolted because of him
was on the receiving end of racist jokes and comments at my last job all the time going to hr would have done nothing multiple people have complained about the manager and they ended up being terminated instead hr is a joke anyway hope you find something better
op be careful with how your proceed i am of mixed ethnicity and i once had a boss constantly rag on my nappy hair went to hr and i was the one that ended up leaving because he made my life even worse after that
if you live in a one party state record it on your phone document multiple times cash out fuck that guy
jesus some of these comments are absolutely wild lol just people basically casually admitting to being slightly racist but quiet about it
i get that a lot of people just don t want the hassle of reporting this inappropriate behavior but do it this complacency and lack of will to fight for yourself and others contributes to how companies exploit us we can always fight back even if it s with just a complaint
don t file a complaint with hr file a complaint with the state labor board nlrb for hostile workplace environment and probably violations of the equal rights amendment hr is not your friend
i understand you hate the job but you work because you must like most of us correct so document every single thing it may be a waste of mins or it may be your ticket to a financial settlement you never know document document document regardless what happens wouldn t you love to send the documentation to hr once you quit
my boss is the same way and wouldn t stop until i said something to him directly i like my job but staying on his good side and not saying anything only made me hate myself stand up for what is right in this situation even if you get on his bad side he will know you don t tolerate it and it may prompt him to become more aware of how he affects other people that s what happened with my boss he hasn t been openly racist since i said something is he still racist probably but i don t have to deal with it anymore at work you could tell him to quit and he does or you may get fired and you the problem is removed by the party that is causing it win win i see since you re not a fan of the job anyway i have no idea what your life situation is but standing up for what is right in situation is worth it i feel
put your phone in your pocket on record every time you interact with that man eventually you ll get him on tape and have a massive advantage in any negotiation on that issue
i saw your comments about not documenting but you are so wrong i was fired for my religion from large company when something happened i ignored it tried to move on a lot of money but i was fired later for no cause and i knew it was because they found out my religion document everything
you should still document it for your own records because if you ever do get fired for saying something you then have support for a claim of retaliation which if nothing else works in your favor if you have to file for unemployment and they try to say you were fired for cause
don t be a passive coward please
find another job and use glassdoor or similar to post about your treatment at that company you will hopefully find a better employer and warn others about your current company
i have a friend who was in a similar situation one a few black guys at his place of work they would have open floor team meetings a couple times a week after he d been there a couple months the owner dropped a n bomb in one of those meetings referring to some customers my friends spoke up immediately in front of the group was told by the owner if he didnt like it gtfo so he did went straight to his attorneys office who referred him to a different attorney that specializes in such things a letter went out that week inside a month he reached a settlement just under 50k if you want the behavior to stop sacrifice yourself on the alter of their money to make it happen
it would have created a paper trail for when you report it to eeoc it would be a paper trail of your racist boss s actions and your company s failures to take action to stop his racist actions keep paper records of every and make a complaint with the eeoc hr is not there to protect any employees but the company if the boss had continued after a complaint it would have been his job in jeopardy because no company wants to be part of an eeoc investigation
never go to something named human resources like you re some kind of office supply in human form they re there to manage you as a resource not to be your advocate
just say bud light is your favorite beer
document and lawyer
record him sue him get a decent settlement and live a happy life
the thing to do is act like you don t understand when he says something racist look confused and say huh or what or whatever then say i don t understand what you mean get him to have to explain his comment don t act shocked or surprised just look more and more confused
ask him to explain his racism most is done for humorous effect take the punch out of his racism by asking him to explain it
no job is worth tolerating that call him out in the most harmful way to the company you can
start recording on your phone anytime he comes in the room make a comment about a topic you know he will make a racist remark about sue the fuck out of him profit
lol it s hard to find a work environment that s not racist where i live bunch of hicks
if he s being openly racist as you claim you could get him fired that s not acceptable in any work place
i ve dealt with this semi successfully what helped was that i had an otherwise good relationship with the person they valued my professional opinion i asked them to consider the professional ramifications of what they were saying becoming public fwiw i m pretty sure they stopped not because that would be shameful but because cancel culture is a big problem right now but they stopped regardless i ll take the w
hr is not your friend they exist to protect the company s money not you
in usa this doesn t qualify as a hostile workplace fucked up jobs can do and say almost anything and you have the right to quit if you don t like it but very little recourse if you re suffering a toxic workplace something to do with proving intent and having bullet proof evidence and still you d just be fighting to stay a at a bad job usa is in need of an upheaval we will be worse off in 10years it s very bleak look at the folks set to inherit leadership roles the worst of us
if you don t stand up for yourself it will continue i d rather be the target than the doormat
record him sue him get a lot of money as settlement
such hopeful children the eeoc is just as corrupt as the businesses the supposedly investigate go ahead and file a complaint and you will be without a job documentation does not matter the only thing that matters is money and businesses can always buy their way out of trouble
can we add the tag complacent but still wants sympathy to this sub
i suppose asking what you consider openly racist will get me scorned here eh
what exactly did they say because these days y all claim everything is racist
save it for the exit interview actively look for another position if you re hating it anyway
i had the same type of experiences as op and after reading a few of the top comments the general advice seems to be to be pretty indirect even though they are your boss i promise you the simple phrase dude or dudette that s not cool will clearly inform your boss that you aren t comfortable with racist remarks i don t receive backlash from my boss when i need to say this he knows its wrong he just stops and that s the end of it maybe a year or so later need to repeat but same thing no drama no big scene just a small phrase that communicates the point clearly and it s over with
the fact that you haven t recorded him yet makes me wonder on how disturbing it is to you get that fucker on tape and get him fired
what s your boss saying i ask b c the definition of racism has become really broad over the past few years edited to be more clear
would you prefer your racist boss to be closed racist in front of you
removed
what if you made remarks in return about the boss ancestry haha sometimes you have to out asshole the assholes to shut them up
you ll put your employment at risk but being silent is being complicit
you need to be hurt by his comments for example he says a trans joke tell hr that you have a trans cousin and you feel attacked he says a black mexican asian whatever joke you too have a step dad that is that same color and you feel disgusted by his words
you are already on his bad side if he s making those comments in front of you
you should try working in the trades this would never happen
not sure what type of company you work for but hr is the right place to go eeoc is a joke unfortunately so many bogus claims get made to them they will take forever to do anything at all
if he was being overtly racist then hr would be aware and he would be fired maybe it s just your perception as opposed to reality you seem like you hate your current position and this makes you feel even more justified in leaving
can you give us an example unfortunately people are a little loose with racist these days if he s being racist and hr won t do anything you don t want to work there any way
would you rather he be secretly racist like the vast majority of humanity you know where he stands thats a plus is he racially disparaging you
when i worked retail at my boss did the same i just stopped going in not worth being around that kind of trash
anyway you can get them on video or audio
put phone on record audio in your pocket find out who to report evidence to
eeoc complaint
check out the recording laws in your state if you live in a one party state and you didn t sign any sort of no recording at the office thing you might be able to record him secretly on your phone if not write everything down share it with a trusted friend over your personal email and then file a complaint with the nlrb
same
i would have walked out the first time
document document document then sue
you are working in a hostile environment eeo specific term about which they are doing nothing like angrymogwai document everything to include witnesses they could be quite fucked at an eeoc hearing
yyyyyyup this was me working in commercial landscaping in texas worked at different companies over the span of or years and they were both awful never again
what a chad joking
i quit a good paying job because the family owned company was so racist and just parroted fox news propaganda that i couldnt stand to hear another word out there mouth i was there best employee and did the majority of the work and one day i just ghosted them and it was very enjoyable to never hear that vile shit again
so i am in the same boat and this is what i am doing now i have a document and everytime they say something uncomfortable or whatever write down the day and the time my manager is lazy as well and doesn t do things that are promised so i am writing down things that he d say he d do but didn t to cover my own hide
i had a boss who specifically said she would hire a particular ethnicity because they always ended up stealing
had an indian boss that refused to work on indian patients
guess each employer is different where i work remarks made of that nature are dealt with quickly
film or record them doing it and release it anonymously
man so many people work for really shitty people channel gives me great appreciation for my work you should get a new job
i spoke up to my hr rep at my last job about racist employees hr is not there to help you they are there to help the company only i was the one reprimanded
my boss is like this he thinks that because i m a well to do white guy like he is that it s ok nope i just know better than to rebuke him i won t change his mind and his filth and others at my company perpetuate this poor culture that shoos away younger talent who are far less likely to put up with this bullshit once he retires if this company is still alive at all i ll do away with those notions myself
record his racist ass
examples
it s depends on what he said how it would be handled anyone can say something that sounds racist but is not at the end of the day it depends on who u report to and how they would handle it
just reminds me of my manager when i worked retail years ago she made a racist joke about the names black people give their kids but when she had kids of her own named them shit like braydyn and kaydyn
check if your state has one party consent for recording and get that shit on tape
record him on your phone just bait him into saying something racist
look for another job while also filing a complaint don t use this manager as a reference
you know they do make ink pens that have decent video cameras inside of them or a button cam or even just record voice conversations on your phone especially if it is a one party system you live in
secretly record him tip off the local news anonymously
document everything as much as you can add details then contact eeoc
welcome to life
there is always plan b
what s the laws where you are about recording people i d record anyway then take notes and use the notes really crazy this continues to happen
same but only to asian an indians
why can t op just quit
i had this happen you are right hr did not jack shit other than ask me how i felt when they said what they said like wtf lol
quit protest or keep putting up with it your choice
i would ve caught a charge i don t have patience for racist people hr isn t going to do anything they aren t they re for you they are there for the company
if you live somewhere where you re allowed to record someone without telling them then do that to add to your documentation for reporting
so quit and find somewhere else where you won t be offended
record the rant
can you secretly record him saying racist things that is a smoking gun
how about using a cheap spy camera or audio recorder anon send it to hr
that s disgusting i hope you are quiet quitting to the best of your ability
record him post it here
get records and sue them
does it affect your ability to your job and if so how
what did he say
always say hours a day days a week is a sweet spot of us being happy and capitalism still getting their monies worth out of us i don t see any chance of it being implemented for another years if that
wait the hour day day work week originally conceived by henry ford in the 1920s for assembly line workers is out of date couldn t imagine why
getting back from lunch at 2pm when you finish at really helps btw
truth i work hour and can get all my work done in about depending on the day then i just watch youtube videos
chuckles in sewage treatment
i can accomplish most daily tasks in hours or so what gets me working late is waiting on tasks from other teams they ll sit on it for days then email some absurd question at 4pm on a friday
i work hours a day days per week buuuuut it s night shift so it t hours work and hours fooling around with the other nightshift playing videogames watching movies pingpong and just hanging around also food is provided after working nights i m free for days including paid vacation i am free for weeks per year it s fucking great also great pay for essentially being a glorified babysitter
tell me about it i work fucking hrs a day
laughs in nursing
i wish more companies would adopt rowe result only work environment and give employees the flexibility to work as needed and wherever they are most productive i know this doesn t apply to all jobs since some positions like in retail require physical presence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rowe)
i gave up car ownership now work hours a week hours days i m still broke could save by working more but fuck that i want to enjoy my life as it passes i don t think saving for retirement is going to pan out for us somethings
brotha i worked hours straight yesterday crunching numbers in excel would cry if i could leave at
as a programmer and if the hour work week were a thing i d probably choose to work hour shifts i genuinely enjoy my work in spite of the fact i m working on a product of which i have ownership and i work best probably due to hyperfocusing when i get momentum going and just work until i run out of steam interest for the day plus then i d have days off a week to get all the shit done i can t do because work stretches across of days of the week
days a week is too long i d like a day work week
don t act like you wouldn t be making this same post advocating for a hour workday if we actually had a hour workday op
the human body evolved over hundreds of thousands of years so u can sit at a desk in a sterile cubicle and look at fake lights in a box and pretend u dont want to kill urself and if u can t focus on doing that for hours a day days a week that s a mental disorder
it kind of depends on what you are doing for office work i personally would work hours instead of if it was days a week that said there is certainly a mid day drop off if you try going straight through human brains just have issues if there are not breaks in between all that said the issue imo isnt hours a day its only potential days off a week
i run out of work to do after about minutes sigh
hours a week is my sweet spot but that s only because the overtime pads everything
bertrand russell has entered the chat
i know the feeling i work hours and maybe have hours of work a day
i work hour days alternate between and day work weeks 8hrs depending on the job really isn t that bad
and can we all be disgusted that children do hour days many do before school drop off so their parents can work stupid hours so now you got kids doing upwards of 10hr work days no naps no real break i mean come the fuck on little humans are trying to do cell division and grow more bones synopses skin and muscle while learning from equally exhausted teachers
everybody in this sun is a lazy ass
i had a job where we had four hour shifts love that job four hours working made way for a wonderful life balance i was social and worked out everyday
bro i feel this except i work hrs a day i m sitting here realizing i have hrs left
nothing will be as bad as the military working hours
best case scenario is we move to you won t ever get people would always want of the best shifts and the other would be understaffed and eventually you d all be back to 8s
this may be a hot take but i really enjoy hrs a day days a week working days a week was draining for me and a massive pain in the ass if i needed to run errands
well i work more than yep anyone with half a brain could see op thinks people who work more than hours should be able to work less too it s like some of you people can t imply something very obvious from a plainly read sentence i agree op hours is too much your day hours sounds like a dream
yes we produce more than any population in history we don t need more than this a lot of the need for production would be reduced with less work as well
try a 12hr shift with mandatory overtime you re just thinking yeah half hour left then they say you have to stay
oh yes it s called part time employment you should do it
10hr days days a week is the best it s like only two more days take one day of pto and you have more than half the week off we cycle working weekdays and weekends so every month we get days off then days off the next month it s like a vacation every month
tbh most of the time anyone mentions working hours being too long or suggests shorter days i always think its kind of a side point the central issue isn t length of time worked it s pay per hour if i can afford to live off 40hrs work a month then it s a good system i can pick and choose these hours for some that means 2hr days for others it means years of 10hr days then retirement the problem with the way it currently is is that many have to work 60hr weeks until they die just to survive the lack of choice makes it bad all round not only bad for these individuals but the entire economy as it lacks flexibility
i m all for less work and fair pay and most of what this sub stands for but work still has to be done and alot of it isn t getting done in hours think of everything you like everything you consume not only that but roads your drive on electricity and utilities we use ect almost all of that would be not possible or in very short supply if everyone only worked hours a day even if all of us were getting hour and money was no option if you want a functioning society people are still going to need to work and shit work too i m a plumber and i promise you if water is flooding your house or shit is overflowing from your toilet you re not going to want me on the other end saying sorry i worked my already better luck next time
hours that s cute
an hour day is not unreasonable yall are trippin
you are one lazy fuck
lol
hour days days a week hour pay not a new concept and completely doable
lmaoooo
how many hours a day would you be working if you had to grow your own food harvest the wood and build your own house make your own clothes etc we work hours a day to pay other people to do all those things for us we divide the work that needs to be done so we don t have to do it all ourselves society
lol as a trucker this whine makes me laugh
who do you expect to build houses keep the lights on and the water flowing
so long as you re willing to accept getting paid for four hours of work
this sub is fucking nuts i don t want to work more than hours a day also why am i not being promoted or paid enough
don t consume caffeine till minutes after you re awake and you won t crash in hours helped me a ton felt good all day
i swear i be lazy and not do anything for hours and then actually work for
healthcare we work 12s man up and quit being a little b
fuck four hours i shouldn t have to do any work and still be paid my salary
removed
try working 12s
lol this is a joke
no it s not it s one third of the day
i can only stand my hour shift because it s broken up into different things each hour i m doing something different so the time goes by fast and not working more than two days in a row is amazing i work every weekend but it s worth it
i generally work hours a day days a week and i find it about perfect gives me enough time to make sure i m eating well sleeping well and not falling behind on basic maintenance like keeping my car clean time for the gym and my dogs stimulated
as a fast food worker yeah eight hour shifts are miserable compared to any other length of shift six is the maximum i m fine with before the exhaustion kicks in four is very very manageable and probably utopian but alas can t have such wonderful things as a hour work day y know the thing scientists recommend
developmentally speaking most humans until the agricultural revolution probably worked about hours a week we thrived as a species for tens of thousands of years on that schedule anything more than that and you are functionally providing for someone else
you hour a day people are seriously lucky it can be alot worse stop complaining
deleted
i ve always considered myself fortunate that shifts are usually hours where i work but can go to hours at night i work at an outdoor beach bar in florida the hour shifts are cause it s hot as fuck
i work a we work days in a row get days off just like any other week but then we only work days and get days off it s nice cause we get to take mini vacations or rest up on the off unfortunately it s hour shifts your on schedule turns you into a zombie towards the end
i always think about how crazy long shifts are in the context of car rides i could drive hours to x place eat an unpaid lunch and drive all the way back
hahaha i work hrs a day for days straight
man i work s lol but i get more days off than most so i won t complain about that as long as conditions aren t dreadful
yup
cackles in pet sitter but at least i love my job enough to be fine working hour days for weeks on end during busy seasons
i work hours a day only on mondays i work hours and it feels like forever
agree and unfortunately i ve been having to work
just spread your work out more and watch some youtube browse reddit or find some other task to do if you get paid to do nothing for hours a day then that sounds great
there are jobs where you can choose to work just hours go work at one
why don t you find a job you actually like the day goes a lot faster then
well somebody isnt working on a farm
with the advancement of technology we should be working fewer hours nor more hour work weeks would be fucking awesome but we really need like s would be flippin magical
you only work hour shifts must be nice
try tv production hour days
i was fortunate enough to try everything hours per week hours a week and so on i think hours per day is the best with the lowest amount of meetings for the record i love my job and it is a challenge not a punishment for me
hours is a short day some days i take people to and from work with only a 45min break for my lunch
my regular day is hours and either it s usually days usually not having a life outside work is awesome wooooooooooo s
laughs in water and sewer
i don t think you would be able to make it in the trades i m unionized so that makes thing a lot easier on myself and my family now i usualy put in hours a week but double time is paid out every hour outside of the regular sheduled hours
big respect for all roughneck on drilling rig i was working in the petroleum industry and it was so hardcore
i would be good with hours a day at most we also need day weekends
it was originally now it is with mandatory unpaid lunch it is too long and was never designed this way it is starving us of social interactions family time time with kids and leaving us mentally and physically exhausted
i don t want to commute to work days a week to work hours i ll take hour days instead
i work a minimum of hours a day for days straight before i have a day off hours a day would almost be like a vacation
medieval peasants had more free time
12hrs a day was like an eternity it s like time stands still since i commuted an hr it s like when i got home i was exhausted shower and ate and then went to bed only to do it all over again
lol wut i feel bad for this country i work seven days a week hours a day waking up at 4am every day
i believe what you are describing already exists if you want a hour work day get a part time job that has hour shifts
who s going to build all these buildings and infrastructure for you on those measly hours you guys gotta remember not everyone sits at a keyboard sending emails
sounds like somebody isn t used to the soul crushing grind yet s
try or hour days
sometimes i finish my work in hours and have to sit there for more because arbitrary rules to keep insurance and benefits plus the unpaid commute times there and back with no escape its a good life its almost like whoever came up with this system wanted to enslave mankind and it worked
try hour days for days straight
i can honestly say since working a job that does hour days hours every weeks has been amazing for me days can be long site but more than doable and then in every week period i have minimum days off more if you work the system having days off in a row feels like a mini vacation every time to me just me though obviously everyone is different
i work hours shifts days a week while the work days are long i really enjoy having week days off every week
the degrowth movement talks about rolling back the workweek from there we can implement a resource based economy
i m a maintenance technician in o g i wouldn t even be able to do some of the jobs in my role if i only worked hours a day
it s always the workers that s the problem never the greedy ass employers offering shit jobs it seems
wdym lol video games are one of the reasons i keep working they don t fall out of the sky i pay for them
to be fair many of us unmarried gamers have much lower costs of living when it comes to recreation costs per hour and being unmarried also means we don t have to provide for as many people due to this some of us have a greater emphasis on the importance of a work life gaming balance and are rejecting the grind for the overly materialistic they just can t understand this way of living the only way they can react is if they aren t working 60hrs a week over two jobs with a side hustle they are leaving the workforce
the slaves are unmotivated to keep working slave owners baffled x200b spend about seven hours a day playing video games rookienumbers jpg
amazing how all these clowns are worried about men not working enough
the best game is eating the rich
these individuals self report playing seven hours a day playing video games so not only are they seemingly unlikely ever to come into the workforce if they do come back they re likely not very skilled i d bet money this same guy also thinks that nobody wants to work anymore and that workers deserve low wages because their job is unskilled i looked him up but he hasn t really said anything interesting though he did claim in that there was a in chance of a recession which is a remarkable prediction considering that we ve been in a recession since
we re used to being the sheltered boomer s boogeyman by now
unmarried women who love to cook unmarried men who love to build legos unmarried women who love to paint unmarried men who love to build cars unmarried women who love crime documentaries unmarried men who love to play guitar you see how that sounds these clowns genuinely think that doing a hobby constitutes as being lazy or unmotivated when in reality hobbies are the things that keep us sane from this shitstorm that is a work environment
i m an unmarried man under y all fired me for having cancer chemo attacks
yeah if you aren t breeding for their slave labor force you are the enemy thanks america
leaving the workforce to do what play video games for a few months before the power gets cut
took months off played video games and drank beer best months of my life
is there at least one economist out there that blames the greedy ceos with their ginormous compensation and not the working class with their spare change of a wage
they have a point marriage and children make you part of a traditional social setup where you will be more motivated to work read more likely to put up with bad working conditions pay etc if you have a spouse and or children to support which is a big part of why right wing ideology is so hot for the traditional hetero social order and so against anything that seems to threaten it
i do know a few middle class dudes who upon quitting a job just live on their savings for a couple months before going back to the job search honestly if they have the money to do it i don t see a problem with it especially looking at how retirements are going why not use a little of your savings here and there but i think the real reason we keep seeing so many articles about how negative leaving the workforce is is really to try to gasslight you oh im not like those losers i d never quite my job but nobody is that dumb
6th highest incarceration rate in the world of the us prison population is ages to and is male https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics\_inmate\_age.jsp](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_age.jsp) sure sounds like gaming to me
when the upper management and ceo of any company make record profits and the workers are struggling to afford groceries it is obvious why no one wants to participate in a rigged game
lol we need to start coming up with retaliatory headlines and shoving them down their throats who will take a stab at it
how the fuck would i be able to play video games if i didn t work do rich people think we can just not work and everything will work out for us this is as braindead as when people say stimulus money from three years ago still has everyone flush with cash they are either lying or so stupid i m surprised they remember to breathe
if they said eve online then i might actually believe it that game takes your soul
i m unmarried and under but i only think of video games as a friend
is this gamers finally rising up
if i can make more money sitting at home playing videogames then why should i work a making h
what about over married women who love video games the lure of an exciting existence outside of the mundane world is appealing to us too
lucky bastards
oh video games are to blame again what is this 2004m
oh theyve been blaming gamers for years now
it s me i m the problem happy to disappoint you
whos leavign the workforce people who cant afford living while working
clearly they don t know how videos games work like any habit hobby it requires money to enjoy it most unemployed gamers usually get funds cut off from whoever is enabling them by their 30s so they re at least working something freelance min wage to buy new games and equipment
sadly its the married ones too according to certain subreddits
live your best life kings
people work against their will if they have to support their family but would quit aslong as only themselves suffer since having no money in todays society is still better then goin to work call me absolutely shocked by the result
i am conscious of my decision shaming is all they have left soon they ll tax us watch video games give me more joy that almost anything getting paid it is a protest to the current system i will not work more than i need to survive have kids or get married this system can go to rot as currently constructed they think it s bad now wait til gta6 drops
they re just throwing things at the wall until something sticks also men under is a massive demographic
hey that s the face of a pompous career academic i met loads of them in my phd people like him have no life outside of work and schmoozing
more like who s being ostracized in the workforce oh you re not married have no kids or house sorry _ _ _ _ _ _ _ really needs this more than you
gotta love economists for all their disdain of the soft sciences they sure are quick to indulge in them sociology psychology philosophy meanwhile economics has all the predictive power of a pack of tarot cards
sorry guys it was me all along driving the country intl the ground not special interest groups corrupt politicians and lobbying groups like the auto and gas industries signed a sub y o male gamer
i need to go to work so i can have a home to play video games in
i don t even have time to really go out and do stuff without being tired how am i supposed to find somebody to marry
just blame anyone but the top ers paying you
ah the old divide and lose elections forever gambit it s almost as if the more they try to alienate everyone who isn t a maga boomer the less chance the right have of ever attaining power keep it up losers
didn t the fed say we need higher unemployment to reduce inflation isn t this a good thing if people are leaving the workforce
the people leaving the workforce are the people the workforce broke
thanks to being able to roll public holidays in and buy an extra week i have vacation days this year and i will absolutely be using most of them to play video games
these constant stream of articles are fucking rage inducing the fact that they are created paid for not the fact that they are posted here no employer is entitled to an employee s labour it is an agreement between the two either provide the pay and conditions that workers are asking for or don t but if you choose not to play ball you can t chuck a spoiled fucking tantrum when workers decide to abstain from working in favour of doing what they actually want to do
gamers rise up haha
not just gamers but they re blaming men again not unmarried gamer girls but unmarried gamer men
laissez not faire
that s because video games are better than reality that s the real problem
i left the workforce at because my mom got sick i placed her into a home but popped in everyday to check on her she was always in a dirty diaper she couldn t feed herself and her trays were untouched so i started leaving for lunch and would feed her my employer was like hey everyone parents die i quit the next day just never showed up the bastard had the nerve to blow up my phone demanding passwords and such fuck him
say it with me children there is no such thing as a labor shortage in a capitalist economy you are not paying enough to attract workers
people with no dependants strapping them to their job are doing what everyone with a shitty job wishes that they could do
they can cry harder
unmarried gamer here i may be depressed and very lonely and i really could use a hug right now but i have a stable job

this is what they teach in economics classes wild cheerleading and scapegoating based off what worked in the 70s
they are people just looking for views to show ads
substitute gaming with sitting in a garage drinking beer and watching sports and we ve just described every boomer
i often think about becoming a youtube gamer that s where the money is ish
so first it s the millennial who seem to span from according to these experts then no one wants to have kids now it s the gamers fault maybe point your fingers upwards towards the top of the chain because that s where you ll find the real problem greedy ass bosses who s trickle down economy trickles down into their 3rd boat or holiday home
video games are like the largest form of entertainment on earth now i think so it isn t surprising people would go for them the article could just call them hobbyists because it s a hobby but likely wants to conjure up a stereotype but this trend would really point to sadder things deaths of despair are up in men and have been for years especially non college demographics and men are doing worse at higher education rates even while degrees are still halfway meaningful in the economy if people are really doing what the article says it s because the economy doesn t seem to want them not because men ain t shit if you lose your job and can t quickly find another one you can be in for a whole gauntlet of a time lasting years in some cases
i mean the family is breaking down countrywide and the price of houses is going up faster than wages are most young men feel like they ll never have a family or a house you know the entire point of going to work but sure it s video games fault
yeah unemployed guys with depression
gamer oppression
i swear rich people just know their useless family members and assume everyone is just like that i think the lazy ones are the investors who swear the world would stop if they weren t allowed to not fucking do anything of value
wait i left the workforce shit better notify my boss then

maybe people are just giving up i d rather be poor and play video games than be poor and go to work this issue and the fear of losing medicaid are the biggest reasons why i only work part time right now
i fit in this demographic and nothing would make me happier than to leave the workforce but my dumbass bought a house and a car and i i have to go to work just to pay for it so i can play more video games
i don t understand blaming video games i m a girl who likes to play video games once and awhile i feel like the us will become japan and south korea when it comes to the birth rate dropping
i m this guy and i work i just don t work a shitty job i work for a good small company that pays me well and allows me to work at home whomever wrote this article can choke on my xbox elite controller
i love how my work who goes through literally hundreds of people a year blame everyone for not wanting to work they don t get people don t want to work at a shitty ass job where they can barely afford to live so they re half right ya people don t want to work but for reasons they can t seem to comprehend
wtf does an economist do
unmarried gamer reporting i still work and pay my bills and rent because i would be tossed out on my ass if i didn t
maybe because they make more money streaming their games for subs and ad revenue than they ever will working retail or in the service sector
too bad we aren t more like france
love video games or love escaping this nightmarish reality of a workplace and video games are in reach unlike vacations
who s leaving the workforce people realizing they re slaving away year after year with no pay increases while their employers record record shattering profits
oh hell nah now they re going after our people fuck these corpos
i just turned this last monday i am not married all my free time is spent playing video games i work you see i like my job i love my bosses and my coworkers and i feel the pay is fair funny how not hating my job or people in it has resulted in my being an exception to this study
i m unmarried because of all the excessive overtime the past years on a wacky schedule who am i going to meet on a tuesday night
yup
you heard it folks is the new minimum
inflation is a much more serious problem than minimum wage if they made minimum wage but prices go way up that wouldn t help anyone we need our money to be worth more
oh ffs over here fighting over crumbs while the fat cats are loving large and making away with all the cakes
ignore that request encourage open communication look for another job in the meantime
this request is just a request because they are probably cheating a lot of you and if you knew how badly you could negotiate better and that s the last thing they want
they can ask you not to but you re still allowed to i would encourage you to do so
talk about it loudly they can t make you to not discuss it
get it in writing then report it to the nlrb
they can tell you whatever they want doesn t make it legal
masking tape with sharpie on your chest where a name tag would go
if you re in the us you re protected by labor law to discuss your own pay i m not sure however if you re allowed to discuss someone else s pay without their knowledge for example i can tell my team how much i make as their supervisor i however can t tell my team members what another team member makes without their knowledge since i know their pay but i m not at liberty to divulge someone else s information if i m wrong in that though i d like to be corrected
i would simply ask if he realizes that his request is unlawful
i d say try and get him to give it to you in writing
ask them to put it into writing for you
as suggested you should all be talking about your pay this is one of those red flags everyone is always talking about
ask for it in writing
get it in writing report it win
there is a lot of precedent that says we can hey charlie i get paid x what do you get what sure i think it would be great to talk about this in the hr office
if you are in the us go to the us labor website and either print out the statute that states what he said is against the law or try to contact them and request one of those big know your worker rights posters to hang in the breakroom
if they keep the manager start the job hunt you re gonna have a hell of a target on your back going forward op
tell him f off
well that is protected by federal law so share away keep everything in writing from them in case they try to retaliate which is also illegal
so they didn t actually specifically say not to discuss salary either way you are allowed to you should talk about it it s one of the only ways to know if everyone s being treated fairly also look to see if they re posting on linked in or other job related websites to see if they re hiring and what the starting salary is
if you are in the us you can post on the wall next to other mandatory labor law signs your right to discuss wages under the national labor relations act nlra or the act employees have the right to communicate with other employees at their workplace about their wages wages are a vital term and condition of employment and discussions of wages are often preliminary to organizing or other actions for mutual aid or protection if you are an employee covered by the act you may discuss wages in face to face conversations and written messages when using electronic communications like social media keep in mind that your employer may have policies against using their equipment however policies that specifically prohibit the discussion of wages are unlawful you may have discussions about wages when not at work when you are on break and even during work if employees are permitted to have other non work conversations you have these rights whether or not you are represented by a union
just makes for a bunch of disgruntled employees as everyone thinks they deserve the most generally while it s nice to know where you stand half will lie and many will become angry and unproductive
talk about it loudly try to get them to punish you or tell you not to in writing sue
only managers not supervisors are salaried at my job in one of our team meetings they stated that discussing pay only leads to unnecessary drama i stated loudly that thinking only benefits the owners a single family owns the corporation and is full of billionaires then i said how much my pay is and what my most recent raise was a couple other people kind of mumbled something but if we don t talk about it someone and it s a worker is getting the shaft
ask them or what they currently haven t done anything wrong they didn t say you cannot discuss under threat of punishment retaliation
ask to get that in writing lol
hey person who does the same job as me here did you hear they don t want us discussing salaries i wonder if that s because we make wildly different amounts for the same job
my move when this happened to me was to be in cognito about it lol like have good rapport with your coworkers and make jokes about your salary so they will open up about theirs you re all just people and being transparent is helpful it is unlawful for them to ask you not to discuss this so they cannot fire you for it the reason it s illegal is so that they cannot get away with funny business i had a colleague who was getting paid 7k more than me with less experience and relevant education simply because she was older we took it to the top as friends coworkers bc she knew it was b s too we both ended up leaving this position but it was really helpful to know about the pay disparity and where the company s values lie
ask them for that in writing then file a complaint with labor and start looking for a new job
malicious complaiance scream ur salary and bonus to the manager let him figured out if u comply to his request or not lol
it s illegal for your employer to force you to not discuss wages but employment is at will so you ll be fired for some othet reason
good for you guys but we do discuss salaries with each other
only applicable in the us but here is the nlrb website about the right to discuss wages salary https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages). again you have the right to tell anybody else what you make but the opposite of that is also true everyone has the right to not divulge their salary wages if they choose not to adam conover does a good job explaining https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xh7egfusyi) why you should discuss your salary with your coworkers
log into anonymous e mail website send e mail stating that what they said was illegal with supported laws encourage them to rescind the statement with the promise that the aclu will be called if the statement isn t retracted by x date follow through
well if be we he means bosses and management then ok if he said specifically that you can t discuss it then i would very discretely drop a card on his desk with a link to the federal law
some of the complaints on this page are just so childish
i would have asked why not
how much do you make at your job
print this out and post it on every bulletin board and in the break room at work https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages
i agree you can t discuss that i make x xx an hour but i can tell anyone i want that i make x xx an hour
i ll add this since i haven t seen it yet send a follow up email to your boss asking them to confirm what was said in the meeting use exact writing and bcc your personal email then talk about it as much as you want if you re fired you have documentation
any job can tell you that hell mine says that too but they can t enforce anything punitively about it in reality employers know that employees talk to each other about salaries shit happens they need to get over it
get it in writing
https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages#:~:text=however%2c%20policies%20that%20specifically%20prohibit,are%20represented%20by%20a%20union.
being hourly or salary doesn t matter it s if you re exempt or not exempt employees can be prohibited from discussing wages being salary non exempt is actually pretty good since you re guaranteed to be paid for a minimum number of hours per week and you still qualify for overtime
you could discuss your salary and bonuses as a matter of principle to show your employer that the practices they re attempting to engage in are inappropriate and unlawful that will also single you out and make you not necessarily a target for retaliation but it will definitely make your coworkers and bosses treat you differently a bit of a pariah because your bosses will be mad at you and your coworkers will be cautious not too get themselves targeted not saying you shouldn t discuss wages but it will likely change the atmosphere of your work life
converting you to salary is likely a scam be sure to look up the rules for salaried employees management and that you aren t being illegally misclassified i used to work at an ambulance company that would promote everyone to a salary position so they could work you hours a week along those lines working through lunch or staying late to get the work done is supposed to come with a give and take like taking a long lunch for a dr appt or leaving early to pick up a sick kid if they make you take pto or dock your pay it s also probably illegal
that s usually a clear indicator that you should all be sharing salaries with one another
this isn t fight club i m telling everyone who applies here what they should ask for this un named casino in new orleans is posting all jobs at half what they pay people here if they get people at the lower salary they will continue to lay off the higher salaries
that only means one thing someone is getting screwed
ask them to put it writing for you
is it in writing other than that it s called hear say unless you can prove it with a recording that was legally obtained
i remember the first job that told me this i worked at a library they claimed it s because if someone wasn t a hard worker they would complain for not being compensated like a hard worker guess how i found out i was the lowest paid with the most experience but my experience didn t count because it wasn t paid experience yup me
you should ask your employer to tell you why they told you that
run
they have to say that it s not allowed requesting that you don t do it is legal albeit unethical it s bothersome and i get worked up every time it happens but as long as they don t cross that line there s nothing you can do
managers can tell you not to discuss your salary all day long they just cant do anything to you if you do actually discuss it
the salary taboo was literally just created so people could pay black people and women less money the employers gaslit generations of workers into thinking discussing money is rude
okay
that s when you turn the person next to you preferably a coworker you might be fond of maybe not it doesn t matter and go so anyways i have gotten a pay raise since x how about you
you mean flsa not nlra secondly in your new offer letter or job description are you categorized as flsa exempt or non exempt
the talking to the manager will receive you were smart enough to use ambiguous language to make sure it couldn t be pinned on us in any way and you never put anything in writing great job
my work actively discourages us from talking about salaries because they don t want the people who have been there years finding out they are on less than new hires or that each team is massively paid below market rates for our jobs we got annual remuneration in sept and inflation was already at the person doing my job she was primary i was supposed to only be the backup i lacked experience despite putting my hand up for it and then they asked others to do it and told none of them that i had volunteered backfired on them when she did it for months and then left for a massively higher paying job she got an extra for the role and there was such a stink about things in the team in general new software it was a circus and still is that they were making hush hush deals with people on their salaries to try get them to stay they all left anyway i asked for the same the other lady was getting for the role when she left and i took it on and they said no there s no money coz all the budget has been tied into the continued dev of the new software because they learnt nothing years ago when they brought in the last new software half baked and had to fix it all up after install and traumatized and then lost staff they did exactly the same with this new software and to date have lost staff totalling about years experience during this time we were all talking about our pay rates and all getting told off for talking about our pay rates i told the team leader that he and the manager and the office managers about them couldn t expect us not to talk to each other about the things we were unsatisfied about which included pay they never had confidence in me to do the role and made that pretty clear was super funny they ended up with me anyway when the other one left i was never staying long term after they refused to pay me the same or more as her and i moved to a well managed team across the office this year my resting heart rate decreased by several points due to lack of stress more pay actually being appreciated and supported and backed up in my new role my temporary contract finishes in ish months and i will be expected to go back to my old team but they will have to pay me the same rate as i am getting now or i will be leaving and taking the skills i learned along the way with me to a higher paying job out of that company that pays much less than market rates and that s the kinda reason they don t like you talking about your pay coz it inevitably leads to them having to pay people more
let me add you should get that in writing before you do anything don t make it obvious that you are about to stir shit up send the following email boss i just wanted to clarify something we discussed in the meeting i get that i shouldn t ask somebody their salary that seems kind of invasive just to be sure i m not supposed to volunteer any information about my salary either right if somebody asks me about my wages what should i do is there a reporting process is there a policy in the handbook i can refer somebody to i just want to be sure i don t cross any lines thanks
this is the way
also good chance they are screwing some of all of you if you work ot they will try to take it away but still have you work it exempt or do some crazy math to determine your salary i worked in finance so know all the tricks they pull
this
this request is illegal and violated his rights https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages
factsssss
in the us this is true unfortunately in many countries they allow companies to fire employees for discussing wages
they can t even ask you not to the very act of asking you violates the nlra
no no they can t it is a violation of his rights https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages
in the us they are not even allowed to ask you not to that s a violation
in the 90s i worked for a company that had the do not discuss wages meetings at the end the boss asked if anyone had any questions i spoke up and asked him how much he was being paid everyone took it as a joke but i was dead serious
or talk about it quietly so they don t have a chance to break it up but yes if they learn about it they can t do anything

what is the nlrb
i think you re right
do you have a source for this exempt has nothing to do with it as far as i have ever seen
rhymes with sarah s
i wasn t the lowest paid but i was within a dollar of the lowest guy that just started years at the company and was the team lead prior to minimum wage i was like dollars ahead of him but i was being paid cents more than the cut off being compensated for the minimum wage bump totally a narcissist trait divide the people you lie to so they can t compare the bs and figure out the real story
almost i would change the phrasing of i m not supposed to and make it i am not allowed to
this is perfect
me in the comments checking if someone dropped how to file
yeah i know op lives in texas
even in the us don t they have states where you can fire at will
this is true the request policy alone violates the nlra also i m very skeptical of this move from hourly to salary bs likely violates the flsa if there is no change in job duties
this energy is before its time bravo
the national labor relations board the guys who are responsible for investigating and enforcing the nlra national labor relations act which can be found here nrlb https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages)
national labor relations board https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/fillable-forms
i could be wrong but i think it does since exempt means not subject to the nlra and that s the law that makes it legal to discuss wages organize a union be paid overtime etc my real point is that you can t make a blanket statement that employees can discuss wages since there are people that aren t covered by the nlra
possibly unless there s another casino right next to the french quarter
i would for sure change this text up a bit because it might get scanned for plagiarism never know
yup right to work state they can fire the op not give him a reason and as long as they pay the unemployment they have no repercussions
sort of there are still laws surrounding retaliation
depends if the pay and title increases
thank you i might need them soon i asked my hr for a salary correction and they threatened to terminate me i work for a well know big bank and they don t even want to pay me right
i think you might be referring to supervisors which are excluded from the term employee as part of the nlra although may be protected from retaliation when refusing to violate the nlra the term supervisor means any individual having authority in the interest of the employer to hire transfer suspend lay off recall promote discharge assign reward or discipline other employees or responsibly to direct them or to adjust their grievances or effectively to recommend such action if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature but requires the use of independent judgment then later it refers to supervisors again sec construction of provisions a supervisors as union members nothing herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization but no employer subject to this act subchapter shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law either national or local relating to collective bargaining ianal and i think this means supervisors are not protected like regular employees for participating in the same way edit corrected copy paste anyway i think it means that supervisors can belong to unions explicitly however they aren t protected for speech in forming the union
that is not what right to work means right to work only means that you cannot be forced to join a union in order to work all op needs to do is email hr with a recap of the conversation they had and bcc their personal email any reprisals stemming from that discussion should be brought to the labor board and the email can be used to establish a retaliation claim don t surrender don t fall for the you can beat them bullshit you can beat a company in a labor claim just need to always keep records of these kinds of conversations
that s not true if employee gets the policy in writing and can show they were fired aftee
beat me to it
headline why young workers are demanding longer hours and lower wages i find it really gets me motivated being underappreciated brings out the best of me it s like living in one of those sci fi dystopian movies only it s real so cool
so they re just outright lying now
journalism got so much easier once i started just making shit up this author
sure commuting is so much fun give them time to discover it s unpaid time that is lost every day ps and btw if companies were forced to pay for commuting time they would all become the greatest advocates of wfh capitalism would already be generating all kinds of functional robots
for those who want to work in the office great fantastic wonderful i am one of those for those who want to work from home great fantastic wonderful i love the fact that you can do the work in a manner that fits you best to those who say everybody must work from the office wtf is wrong with you the idea is to get a job done period to those who say anybody who works from the office is crazy fuck off i just work better creating a different environment than my home life to each their own our goal should be to make sure our employers accept that some folks work better one way while others work better another way and make the best of the situation
as a supervisor i really don t care where the work occurs as long as it gets done we have the technology already in place from the pandemic why wouldn t we keep using it
more purchased propaganda made to look like a news article
this generational stuff is worthless they re citing some people in a broad age range then saying gen this does that over and over it doesn t really mean anything
with lies like these they must be desperate
my old job we would have to come in the office then we would chat over teams to people a few cubes down from us lol it was ridiculous
since the article is not linked i m betting few people read it the data was collected by stanford economics professor nick bloom and wfh research workers argue we re least likely to prefer working fully remote which bloom attributes to their need for socialization snd in person mentoring he s definitely right in that regard as an extrovert myself my something s are very extroverted these days and like being together in person
just openly lying to suit their own agenda
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gen-z-leading-growing-pack-160729113.html
just out of curiosity are there any unbiased or less biased ways to get information on a generation than just what people announce basically like is there a study with a good sample size but yeah this article is propaganda out of people from gen z who i ve talked to including me we are probably split in half for those who like to go into work or wfh in terms of generational bs i feel like people get gen z wrong a lot i had a volunteering job that i resigned early from and i heard some wild capitalist propaganda like we are more likely to work are traditional like the greatest generation and want to volunteer more i m pretty sure polls are showing the exact opposite
no
i always look forward to being more productive for my overlords give em a few more years and get back to us when the dream wears off
well that s bullshit
uh huh sure
yahoo is always pumping this bullshit it s basically national enquirer for your bosses missing a bat boy picture
i know you ve never been more productive but my assistant needs to time your breaks your coworkers can t brown nose me sufficiently over zoom we re paying high rent for this space so i m going to have to insist you return to the office even though it s an hour commute each way
i hate to admit but i m alimentally anti wfh wfh is a bandaid for a myriad of workplace grievances unpaid commute day work week diminishing wages margin shaping via quality of life cuts increasing percentage of businesses engaging primarily in tertiary and qeadinary services sure when you re doing shitty work that means nothing for shitty wages and you don t have to pay for burnt coffee from the break room latte bar it s a little easier to stomach if you don t have to commute minutes there and back and you can do it all from your office but instead of leasing out office space in our homes for free we should be demanding that our employers invest deeply into workspaces that are not only functional but enjoyable to be a part of
sounds like chat gpt wrote this lol gtfo with this garbage
let me rephrase gen z has an incredible amount of experience to obtain before they can get they job they want by going back to the office they are trying to get any job available that pays
no they aren t lol
propaganda is so adorable
i know many gen z trying to stay remote
scott templeton wrote this
another corporation blame game gen z are unhappy at work blame wfh workers svb bank failed blame wfh workers house market overpriced blame wfh workers
i ve always wanted to live in the blade runner future
oh it s been that way
and we re helping spread their propaganda if all you have to add is yeah no don t give shit like this more eyeballs and credit than it deserves just let it die
not in all circumstances some people do enjoy being in the office environment that s not to say that wfh shouldn t be as valid of an option as in office work for jobs that don t require a physical presence but it the option should be based on employee productivity rather than the specific feel good whims of the employer
removed
now
right if you work better in a space to which you commute or if you do it better from home it should be up to the employee tbh i think this absolute hardline requirement of going into the office when it s not required is bullshit and face to face meetings are only an excuse for aging c levels and management to not have to take seconds to learn pay for licenses for video conferencing software like teams or zoom edit what i have seen of gen z is that they do things that make logical sense so if working from home makes sense given the type of job they re going to push for it
yes this i personally hate working remotely of the time not only does it make my job harder the isolation is really bad for my mental health but for those whose jobs can be done and they thrive in that situation let them
shrieks in corporate regressiveism
yeah i don t see why that would make any logical sense if you re going to be using teams anyhow i don t see a need to be in the office of course unless the home environment a person is in isn t conducive to being productive
uhh critiquing and debunking propaganda is not helping spread it the fuck are you on about
no no you do not understand the sentence gen z is leading the charge back into the office is a blatant out and out propagandistic 1984ish lie it is yet another attempt for corporate media to co op our cultural narrative they controlled the us cultural narrative from the 50s into the early 2000s with tv and that control has been shattered they are waking up to that reality and attempting through mass disinformation to retake control over the narrative and dictate everyone s perspectives this article is a lie it is designed to try to bandwagon people everyone wants to go back to the office its just you who s resistinig
oh look a paid shill get the fuck out
removed
i m sure it s extrapolated from some study where a few dozen hundred people of each generation responded and the result they got was that gen z want to work in office was higher than gen x or millennial or something like that no need to overreact to just the headline i m sure it s a little garbage clickbait nothing argument but who are we to say what generations of potential office workers have the most or least desire to be in the office come on there are for sure some bootlicker gen z thinking i want a chance to participate in corporate culture they re fucking dumb most of them will know better over the next few years but of course some of them look at it this way
oh but i do understand i think there s definitely an exaggeration but there is a bit of an uptick in the amount of gen z who actually prefer to go to the office rather than wfh when comparing to other age groups i think we need to ask why these reasons might be for both sides
lmao because our job is easier in person i personally hated working from home i have a fuck load of energy and our office has alot of stuff to do i don t mind being in office
enjoy your trolling ban
for me personally it s because i get bored at home i like my current model of being hybrid with the possibility to work entirely remotely for certain periods of time i think for most people who are starting out it s pretty much impossible to see people and if you live alone that s just depressing it s probably why some people just go into the office it makes them feel more comfortable
you do not speak for your generation at all if you were here to engage honestly you wouldn t have agreed with a blatant propaganda article that s flat out made up gen z as a generation is not leading the charge back into the office they re some of the ones putting up the biggest fight against it your experiences are not statistically relevant nor is your personal perspective if you are indeed being genuine either way you just walked into a thread and supported blatant capitalist propaganda so either you re too unaware of whats going on in the world to realize what you just did or you re subverting the narrative for a reason that involves you having an anti anti work agenda
whatever you say lol
incase you want to read again i stated my experience in my office i did not speak for everyone nor did i claim to you decided to come off hostile for no reason do be sure to check your attitude and get rid of this whole if you don t agree with us you are against us mindset
uhh you directly agreed with the assertion of the article in your first goddamn sentence of reply shut the fuck up with your no i didn t do exactly what i did get the fuck out of this sub and stop talking to me you jackass p s cry more about people not tolerating your bullshit
removed
no i want you to admit that your first words in reply to me were the article is definitely not lying which it is then i want you to go the fuck away and never talk to me again but since that s too hard for you to process welcome to block dick
bwahahaha you re gd brilliant good on you
lol fuck around and find out one thing i ll give the us credit for is the labour boards usually have teeth
have you got the 8k yet
this sweet story of comeuppance brings me joy awesome work dishing deserts to a scumbag
your state is
good fucking shit dude idek you but that seriously made my night better
i m really not brilliant i came here for advice and asked a lot of other people what i should do realistically i shouldn t have done a thing until paperwork was signed but i was just too excited to start essentially a dream job that all being said i have been laughing since i got the reply from the state solely because they also tried telling the state they didn t pay me because they don t have my social security number but that they also paid me the whole thing was a situation of the state going fuck these assholes
i m just blown away i ve had some crappy situations happen where things slip by with the tiniest little excuse and i really needed a win this was a major win i don t want to be the guy that causes strife for anyone else but just fucking pay me ya know it isn t that hard to be an honest person
hopefully you ll get paid quick and its easy to collect hope you don t have to go to court to get them to pay or something congrats
it basically comes down to the state saying you had to pay this much now you pay this much if they still don t pay at that point i m able to take them to court if i took them to court they would be liable for the amount owed to me x2 on top of any other fees and penalties so ideally it should be easy but if they keep going the small amount they would have owed me could end up being a brand new car
if google and amazon were losing money european labor laws would let them lay off workers easily instead they re making record profits and using layoffs to boost those profits allowed in america but not in any country still in the eu if you want to lay off people just to preserve profit levels like amazon google then you re going to have to pay severance
god this is such an awful use of the word amid due to would have been the correct choice
europe is a lot of different countries in dk where i am from we have been better though social security for unemployment so it is easy to hire and fire for the employers because the unions have acceptable rights for their members already in place in southern europe and france it is extremely difficult to fire anyone and increasingly difficult in germany as well after they disabled their social security
never heard of benzinga before so i decided to check out their credibility https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/benzinga/) least biased high accuracy reporting you almost never see that

what the article leaves out is that a programming jobs at these places pays like 150k in europe and 400k in the us not to mention the far larger number of jobs in the us in those companies

in google france doubled their profits compared to why should they fire anybody https://www.france24.com/en/business/20220202-google-parent-alphabet-nearly-doubles-annual-profit](https://www.france24.com/en/business/20220202-google-parent-alphabet-nearly-doubles-annual-profit)
cant have shit like that here thell try to say it s free speech to lay everyone off some shit like kellogs saying ots free speech they can put anything on there cereal box anything they want apparently now there trying to say it s corporate free speech
they wont make that mistake twice
in google france doubled their profits compared to why should they be allowed need to fire anybody makes no sense at all https://www.france24.com/en/business/20220202-google-parent-alphabet-nearly-doubles-annual-profit](https://www.france24.com/en/business/20220202-google-parent-alphabet-nearly-doubles-annual-profit)
it applies to all eu countries that s good at least did it does it apply to the uk despite brexit
you can force this in america with a union and collective bargaining agreements to legally prevent layoffs tech workers would rather be laid off for some reason than pay in union dues to not get fucked over
what do you mean by germany disabeling social security
they are an average business news service reporting for the highest bidder always
while 400k salary is nice it can be taken just like that given you re at will also most people aren t in a job paying anything remotely close to that it s safer to have job protections better working conditions than to maybe have a slight shot at a job that pays that much
in europe on average the cost of living is between and lower than in the us so there is that just do the math and compare our taxes to what workers in the us have to spend on private health insurance medical bills and prescription drugs student loans etc all the money we save thanks to our paid maternity or sick leaves or vacation days and so on just saying oh and last but not least there is more in life than money anyway keep your hours work week well try to keep our workers rights social benefits and overall better quality of life
are you attributing these higher us wages to the lack of employee protections
but once you have a job you re protected and can t be fired or laid off because the corporate management team is incompetent
it s really not even that easy to get a job in the us either i know people who have submitted tens even hundreds of resumes before landing an interview
its easy to get a job in the us companies hire less than what they need every where
i m at my 3rd job the last months in germany because the first turned out to be shit now it s a nice workplace for my second job i had interviews and a test which is seen as excessive here american based founded company mbe mail boxes etc extreme high turnover rate companies in germany want long term employees maybe that means they really look into who fits into the team long term employees are also more professional the longer they stay so no i never heard it s hard to get a job if you aren t a complete idiot in your field or an asshole
well in it at least it s not really hard to find a job there s still a few recruiters that contact me every week since i stopped searching for a new job in september of
it s pure greed
because double is not triple or quadruple profits
wall street is a cancer on society unfortunately they have so much money that they ve bribed the party of labor to become indistinguishable from the fascist party on the issues of big business and going to war growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/edward_abbey_104709 came from this essay https://www.nytimes.com/1976/05/16/archives/the-blob-comes-to-arizona-the-home-of-the-scorpion-the-solpugid-the.html https://medium.com/@wordweaverfree/are-we-growing-an-economy-or-a-cancer-311a0ccc9d60
generally when the eu passes some regulations member countries include it in their legislation after brexit the folks in parliament have been repealing many of those laws the tories consume media owned by murdoch who creates the nonsense that republicans are following so expect britain to become a junior version of the us in the uk workers tend to have actual contracts in the us generally only very highly paid workers or unions have actual contracts
hartz reformen
i m sure lol
this applies at the higher end of the salary spectrum at the lower end look at the youth unemployment rates in france and spain in an at will environment you re also more likely to find another job because companies are willing to hire because they can always fire if it doesn t work out it s the difference between dating and marriage you re willing to go on a date with most people but want to be absolutely certain for marriage
the article is talking about high paid tech employees i make about 500k work hours a week get days off a year plus sick leave and i am about to get months paid paternity leave your ideas of the us work conditions are skewed towards the reality of lower paid workers but doesn t hold for the set of people this article talks about
absolutely if it is easy to fire bad workers unneeded workers companies are much more willing to hire more companies hiring means more competition for workers hence higher wages
exactly and that provides you security going forward whether you find a new job or not that just doesn t exist in the us anymore and our crumbling society shows it glaringly paired with an ass backwards healthcare system there s no rest for the underclass in america
that number is high for youth unemployment i definitely agree but at least on their search they aren t worried about health insurance in the same way you d have to worry in the us there s definitely more protections for workers look at the size of the packages people are being offered to leave their positions compared to us
or maybe you re just showing how privileged and self absorbed you are shall we check a few things vacation day according to the center for economic and policy research a quarter of private sector us workers don t receive any time off at all healthcare every year 530k american families file for bankruptcy due to medical bills wage a report by the washington council of government says that of homeless single adults and of adults in homeless families are full time workers rent a full time minimum wage worker can afford a one bedroom rental in only of all american counties but who cares about your fellow citizens as long as their problems don t impact you they don t matter this level of individualism is a total disgrace
it s similar to when you hire temps contractors or vendors to take care of work you re paying extra because they re not permanent employees
if you were making per year more than your parisian counterparts you can probably afford cobra while looking for the next role
i simply pointed out that averages don t hold for the specific group of people that article is talking about but you can continue ranting and raving
what about for the average person who definitely doesn t make that cobra is ridiculous
no we are talking about workers in general while you are only talking about yourself come on be serious
i agree that we need something better than that we have now for many fields but i wouldn t trade the higher pay i m making in tech for the security that europeans have
your ideas of the us work conditions are skewed towards the reality of lower paid workers but doesn t hold for the set of people this article talks about from my earlier post
i understand your position because of the skills you have whatnot but it s just out of self interest if you re field became flooded was no longer as in demand someday you may feel like most other people with very very limited options
repeating the same bs over and over again won t make it true no matter how hard you try
sex whoooooooo electric bill
that s because investment types are generally sociopaths to some degree
there is just as much money to be made in the tearing down of an empire as the building up of one
mass die offs actually do create serious opportunity see europe after the black death or the colonization of the americas after smallpox
jesus that s bleak though at least they took precautions unlike certain relatives of mine who denied the existence of the pandemic
is this the movie trope where at the end they realize that the disability was inside them all along
and that s why we vax up and follow health and safety guidelines if you won t do it for yourself do it because an investor will lose money
short humanity
i get that the idea of profiting off general misery is nasty but i dislike that we re piling on mercenary cut throat cold to people who are ultimately following health experts advice to avoid getting sick or spreading a pandemic disease like okay their motivations suck but they re still doing the right thing eta never mind they re doing the right thing with regard to the infection they re still vultures
lots of old run down houses going to sherrifs sale prime opportunity to flip and charge a month in rent lots of old farms to buy up and turn into housing developments
what exactly are they intending to clean up
corny
when there are shifts in workforces there is opportunity ready for those to take it but you need to have grinded to get there and be ready when the time comes grinded is a silly word here though i think just doing your job well and becoming dependable is sufficient for most cases i also think it is ok to not care not everyone needs or want advancement
how would they make money off people becoming disabled stopping working and becoming a burden on social services not great for the economy
i mean i see the argument that it s heartless and borderline sociopathic but so is capitalism it s a verified economic fact that disease creates profitable investment opportunities if your options are working a dead end job until you drop dead or making some choice investments after a pandemic or war or something i d choose the investments it s not like he killed anyone he just took advantage of the fact that he knew that people were going to die regardless of what he did

the whole world of finance is completely alien to most of us economy doing well easy to make money economy doing badly surprisingly also easy to make money
or the entire world after world war this is a huge part of why boomers had it so good
miserable
they are probably still taking precautions as covid is still very much a clear and present danger hundreds of people are still dying everyday in the usa and many more are disabled
you know people like to rail against the ppp loans as if there was just nothing but fraud the funny thing is that there wasn t much fraud there didn t need to be we all made so much money from the over heated stock market build on government stimulus and cheap money why cheat fraud is hard work compared to just riding the biggest pump in the history of the us stock market
you have to already have a bunch of liquid capital lying around so you can buy up properties and other assets that are going at fire sale prices because people died or went bankrupt it s classic buy low sell high investment stuff the idea is to then turn those undervalued assets into something worth selling or just hang onto them until you can sell them to someone who will pay a bit more than you did and has the time and resources to develop them example house goes to the bank because the occupants died banks don t like to hold real estate assets so they tend to sell them off as fast as they can for a lot less than they re worth on the open market buy the house in foreclosure and flip it or turn it into a rental property or tear it down and build cheap apartments repeat eta and yeah it s pretty ghoulish it s also a strategy that s inaccessible to ordinary working class people who don t have access to the kind of capital they need to do it in the first place it s pretty much only people who are already in the owning class who can do that
clearly you haven t read into the research and studies that have been completed on covid from my sources at the university of michigan school of medicine covid damages the immune system this is why sometimes a second or third bout of the illness can be far worse than the original infection if it infects one strongly enough it can get into the brain and start causing damage we do know that not all brain damage shows up immediately but often manifests a bit later maybe years later in a deterioration of cognitive abilities there are also too many examples of people with no pre existing conditions or comorbidities that had and continue to have a really bad time from their covid exposure even people in their mid s who were active ate well etc etc
well thanks for letting us know we ll be sure to give your opinion the appropriate consideration
there s a decent of people with long covid my mum had no health conditions and has suffered badly with health conditions since covid

would like to see a working link to information on current death rate not that i don t believe you i ve tried clicking some blue links on the subject around reddit and even a cdc link d me
so are the abortion babies but you do you lobby for them
oh that makes a ton of sense i didn t think of that
which is what worries confuses me with my situation i have a few pre exisiting co morbidities but was vaxxed times before i got covid mid last year overall i was pretty ok except i was unproductive as heck it was like adhd inertia except it wasn t because of my adhd it was distinctly different it went away after about a week weird as heck however the physical toll internally worries me goodness knows the damage i have from an ongoing staph infection since at least diagnosed in and managed the best we can according to the specialist i was darned lucky to not have organ failure etc but who knows what the true state of my wellbeing is getting covid is a worry because who knows what damage that added it s quite scary

here s a working cdc link looks like about deaths per week in march https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/us/covid-cases.html many deaths are likely unreported

more of a screaming into the void situation no you literally just tried gaslighting people on a public forum disabled due to repeat covid i ve been pretty convinced if you have no pre existing comorbidities then covid doesn t do much to ya now you re just backpedalling since your shit take wasn t agreed with edit lmfao the brave baby brained poster did the reply and then block me https://i.imgur.com/be0fnx3.png)

i could get covid and it kills me i m just more likely to die driving to work than dying from covid a better way to look at it since it is also a similarly transmitted illness is that you are roughly ten times more likely to die from covid than seasonal influenza but you are also far more likely to suffer some level of longer term life impacting effect from covid even if you were previously a healthy person it s not death that one needs to be concerned about with covid dying well that sucks the bigger more important issue is longer term health impacts that regardless of your prior to covid state of healthy that may not even be recognizable for years like if you lose your sense of smell from covid it s very likely that the virus got into your brain as it will chase olfactory nerves straight into the brain breaking through the blood brain barrier thus you could end up having a brain fog memory issues that all seem to go away days or weeks after having covid and then bam it s been to years you are now in your s or s and you now have early onset dementia even though you were always a super healthy adult and have amazing genetics always worked out always ate well but your brain was irreparably damaged by covid it just took or more years to really become a problem that s the thing we don t fully know yet because we aren t even years after covid cross the whole globe we won t know the extent of the long term permanent cognitive damage from covid in healthy people for many years we do know that some people whether healthy or not who had really bad covid cases have serious cognitive issues even years after their initial infection people who can t work a full hours if they can even work a total of hours in a day the numbers are very hard to track on that but if you ve been looking much deeper into things like employment numbers available jobs vs numbers of people who were employed pre covid deaths by age early retirement dual income with children households that went single income there s still a shortfall of workers that cannot be accounted for even when you add in far lower immigrant worker numbers a lot of the media are claiming well people are still living on their stimulus checks as if given to people nearly years ago is keeping that otherwise invisible loss of workers from needing to find work i suspect if the numbers were easier to pull that there s been an uptick in ssi disability all i have been able to find is that researchers are seeing that between to of covid patients have long covid and are in various states of being able to work a full time job if they can work at all to circle back around for a moment i don t give a shit if covid could kill me i will if it does so that as it is an extremely uncomfortable way to go but i am far more concerned about becoming permanently disabled which has a much higher statistical possibility for me or anyone really and i m a healthy somewhat active adult i recommend stop looking at the risk of death and start looking at the long term you still live risks of covid the ceo founder of texas roadhouse got covid he survived but killed himself months after recovering because he couldn t live with what it had done to his body and mind that s the shit that i don t wish on anyone
you are also far more likely to suffer some level of longer term life impacting effect from covid even if you were previously a healthy person i can t find any data that suggests this the cdc itself lists the main factors that put you at risk for long covid as basically identical to the factors that put you at risk for covid long covid does not seem to impact many people who aren t impacted by covid in the first place you talk about brain damage olfactory damage tinnitus and those are all very real they re just pretty confined to the same people who covid was confined to the elderly the obese and those with conditions
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs\_press\_releases/2022/20220622.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220622.htm) nearly in americans who have had covid have some level of long covid even without looking deeper at the numbers statistically speaking healthy adults would absolutely fit into the in number again i m not remotely trying to convince you of anything you re already convinced and i am quite certain even if data showed that you had a risk even a risk much higher than being in a car accident not dying but simple being involved in a car accident you re responses are clear that you will decide that is not an actual risk that s fine again i wish you the best of luck
nearly in americans who have had covid have some level of long covid yes and we re still on the same point that some form can mean anything from debilitation to mild symptoms even if data showed that you had a risk even a risk much higher than being in a car accident not dying but simple being involved in a car accident you re responses are clear that you will decide that is not an actual risk it is a risk just a small one
it is a risk just a small one in out of that s not a small risk and as i said you would decide it s not really a risk now you re going to quibble over how bad that could be i get it you are likely younger still feeling indestructible kind of person that s normal
even the supreme court justices need a part time job to make ends meet
ai created title
gasp
every accusation is a confession
no im just dumb
ai probably would have made a more coherent title
isn t glassdoor anonymous though it would be impossible for him to pursue that even if he is right i d ignore his request
ianal but i would leave up the review and ignore their email
in the u s all disparagement clauses and non competes were just invalidated also ignore the email act like you never received it you owe them of your energy attention any longer if he wants to fuck around and find out he can if his ego can t handle negative reviews then he shouldn t be in business adapt or die
so concluding just don t reply he is assuming let him
the key is in the wording they can only imagine it was you
he could only imagine the review was from me in other words he recognised the shitty treatment you got
he has no right to do that for as long as you are not exposing confidential conpany data telling that management makes bad decisions or treats employees poorly or similar is not an issue so just ignore him or tell him it is not your review and him accusing you is unacceptable and legal actions would be taken if that continues but best is to ignore
i signed a non disclosure agreement in connection to a severance payment this is of course hiliariously and explicitly illegal forward them https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-rules-that-employers-may-not-offer-severance-agreements-requiring and ask if they understand that their request breaks the law including retrospectively or of course ignore the idiot lol
don t lie and say it didn t come from you don t respond ignore the email altogether if you wrote an honest review about your experience anonymously there is very very little they can successfully do
reply back that you didn t write it so you cannot remove it he doesn t know it s you he s just guessing
tell them to remove the negative experiences they gave you and you will remove the review
i can only imagine means they know shite as others said ignore it just like when they send those pesky notices about pirating no response is good and f that a hole in the nose hole clearly they need to be exposed
alternatively you could go way above whomever sent the email and contact their boss showing them the email you tell them you re unaware of what the email is pertaining to and ask them to just leave you alone you already signed an nda why would you go past that what you could tell them
ignore the email but don t delete it
op you re getting a lot of bad and even illegal advice in this thread it may be within your interest to have an employment attorney review the agreement that you signed and the review that you posted source am employment attorney
do not take it down
i don t know what you are talking about please don t contact me again
if your former boss had a legal leg to stand on with this they d be communicating through lawyers
admit nothing and do not respond they re fishing and any additional info out there doesn t help op and block the entire company domain from future contact in whatever your email handler is
isn t an nda only for company secrets and maybe the amount of severance pay hush money you get how one experiences working there is not protected unless their brand of toxicity and abuse is patented who knows these days
obligatory ianal but if the nondisclosure agreement and thereby your glassdoor comment was related to any kind of abuse conducted by your former employer it seems to me that the agreement itself is not enforceable besides the only answer if you answer at all that you should give him is what review even if there is enough uniquely identifying information in the review for him to be completely certain that it is you he would have to file a court case against you in order to prove it since he clearly doesn t want those abuses to see the light of day any veiled threats he might issue are completely without teeth because suing you would lend credibility to your review and more importantly it would invoke the streisand effect and in the end your lawyer would be forced to prove that your statements are accurate in court removing all doubt not that it would be hard innocent people don t offer severance payments when they fire you he should probably consider himself lucky that he s getting away with just one negative glassdoor review i mean seriously if he s so confident that the negative review was unwarranted all he has to do is very nicely ask a few dozen current employees to astroturf and suddenly your review gets buried in roses and doesn t even matter anymore
the nlrb ruled that non disparagement clauses are unenforceable leave another negative review citing how the company reached out to you in a threatening manor over something that is unenforceable tell him to go fuck himself
were you a manager or supervisor all employment ndas have been retroactively voided as of you can forward your asshole boss nlrbs new guidance and their legal departments phone
ignore the email but also block their email address request to continue toxic relationship denied
i thought the nda non disparagement non compete clauses were illegal now
ignore and block these people they have nothing on you
don t reply and leave it alone
i ve been off this sub just lurking around and jumped in where i felt i had some knowledge that could be helpful to op and possibly anyone else facing this situation when exactly did r conservative show up to be trolls here the corporate shills capitalists overlords who really are barely middle management all in these comments just acting unduly harmed by ndas being lifted i m sorry to be a bitch but since when is antiwork pro hush money and coercive control over employees when have we ever considered how it may negatively effect the employer who paid money already in ndas that were retroactively lifted who gives a shit these aren t even the basic principles of a free market under capitalism the retroactive lifting of ndas tied to employment regardless of when it was signed these are basic principles of the societal contract humanity and collective bargaining we aren t here to defend employers who paid hush money in the past and if we are let the members know because the trolling and shit posts are annoying af and takes away from workers who are seeking assistance and guidance
i have no idea about what you are talking about but if you persist i m gonna write a review where i ll state you are bullying ex employees
reply and say i have no idea what you re talking about but the fact that you saw a negative review and thought of me just proves that you re aware of toxicity in your company and do nothing to address it
non disclosure is not the same as non disparagement non disclosure usually cover trade secrets and useful knowledge personal connections you made in the course of your work non disparagement covers things like saying i was emotionally abused while i worked here you probably didn t sign a non disparagement if they take you to court two things could happen you both lose a lot of time and money fighting it or you counter sue using anti slapp and lose a lot of time and money but then get awarded a bunch of money if you win
ignore his email you never saw it plus you would never leave a negative review
no response here is the best response they have no proof or evidence
i would ignore the email don t acknowledge that it was you nevertheless these agreements are caput https://www.natlawreview.com/article/recent-nlrb-and-supreme-court-decisions-may-significantly-affect-severance?amp
simply block him say nothing do nothing
didn t the department of labor strike down those clauses recently
non disclosures do not cover this in fact non disclosures were found to not hold up in court ironically it is thanks to trump https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/04/trump-campaign-settles-lawsuit-voids-ndas.html
remind them that most nda s are legally unenforceable and that you don t know who left the negative comment however if they were to pay you fill in the blank amount you will gladly work as a private contracted detective work to see if you can get it removed
i d ignore that email for the next six months then send them a quick reply something like i hardly check this email anymore i don t know what review you re referring to sorry i can t help you if i replied at all you have no obligation to if the review was anonymous it s on him to prove you left it he can go impotently harass glassdoor about that if he really wants to you don t owe him information an admission or an apology
sadly glassdoor is no longer anonymous and they will reveal your details to companies with very little prodding
just tell him he is mistaken and many other must think he s shitty too fuck him
whatever you do don t give them confirmation that the post is yours seems like he s trying to get you to acknowledge it
definitely don t reply i can t believe they had the audacity to even ask you
ask for a consulting fee of paid on a promise the old boss that any posts you placed will be taken down immediately cash check leave post up insist to old boss that there are no posts by your on glassdoor insist that they prove you posted it without invading your privacy
don t admit to anything they re fishing i d ignore
and no don t remove it it implies you wrote it
it would be one thing if this person reached out and asked you to remove the post because they genuinely tried to understand the issues you raised and demonstrated that they had attempted to change their behavior instead they chose intimidation tactics so fuck em
ignore and block
i don t know what review you re talking about but i did look now that you ve told me about it i don t blame you assuming it was mine since it does sound a lot like the awful way your company treated me i m not going to be able to help you with that review but i would suggest that maybe you stop treating people this way if you don t want it to get out if they email you again just tell them to stop and block them
man fuck them employers get all the protections and profits we should be able to fairly review them online without being bullied about it
whatever you do don t acknowledge you wrote it
if he can t prove the review was from you he can t really pursue that
do you have evidence it was me
give me the link and i ll leave another negative review saying that they asked you to remove a negative review
i m sorry what i have no idea what your talking about in about six months go back and update your post on glass door to explain the company contacted you asking to remove the complaint
do not take the review down you d be doing every future applicant a disservice they also can t prove it s you that posted it so any threats are bullshit
employers can t get glassdoor reviews taken down and they know it so this is some pure retaliation which should be reported especially since they have no proof
delete the email you never received the email from your former employee fuck em
don t respond delete the email they aren t your boss anymore
wasn t my review but i worked for a company that received negative reviews from previous staff they couldn t prove who it was so they just asked existing staff to write positive reviews to push down the bad ones this brought our attention to the reviews and most of his staff agreed with them only the ceo s family wrote positive reviews best just to ignore it don t add fuel to the fire by responding
don t admit or acknowledge this in any way they can conclude it was you and go after you could be just a fishing expedition
you need to update your review to include their threat so potential employees are warned what type of company they are considering working for
fuuuuuuuuuck no do not take that post down don t respond
edit your review to add that they asked you to delete it
i had this exact same thing happen to me a few years ago i started in my position in a person dept with one senior person leaving within weeks to pursue her masters and the other hiding liquor bottles inside of his desk he knew the directors bestie so he was essentially skating by on the daily i was never trained unless you count the previous associate s tiny little notebook missing pages and the few pages that were present had dark coffee stains on them i kidd you not and spent the first several weeks twiddling my pen asking what i was supposed to be doing as you can imagine the chic who was leaving was fully checked out and the other dude was drunk anyway i made it nearly years there bf finally and thankfully being terminated i waited a good months and then gave it to them in a gd review my old supervisor who was legitimately a sociopath narc emailed my personal account to threaten me with defamation of character as i mentioned a director being a complete and utter lunatic who spent more time asking me about my social life than guiding me through my position she said and i quote no good deed goes unpunished as i tried to help a single mom start a new career the next sentence outlined that i only worked the hours i was hired for and failed to go above and beyond as was expected ahem meaning staying late every night my commute and at the time my son was was hours each way on a good day railway transit is never reliable and i was never late and never left my desk early i left my house at am and left my desk at pm on the dot never took a lunch break as i either brought every day and consumed it at my desk or didn t eat period my new coworker the drunk was still there until maybe months bf i was finally termed saw everything that was happening but in an expected display of self preservation did absolutely nothing to back me up i understood it as much as it sucked anyway i removed the post never replying to her dumb email and posted an even better one less than a month later didn t hear back after that one though bc my ex sociopathic boss was fired i never heard the actual details but from what i did hear it was not a pretty sight sweet karma baby
i bet i ve never worked there i am willing to post an anonymous review on your behalf and i haven t signed anything
it s too bad after quitting that you changed your email address and never saw his email to you
hey op the truth is this none of us are lawyers so the advice you receive here is only as good as that
why because you are the only one they treated like shit and they know it you should thank him for putting that in writing for you i d post a pic of the email too
tell him to go fuck himself and take that unenforceable nda and shove it up his ass
write another review co founder is now harassing an ex worker because of alleged glassdoor reviews respond to him new phone who dis
report them to the appropriate federal agency and tell them if they continue to attempt to communicate with you then you will file criminal charges for harassment and stalking the national labor relations board has recently held that non disparagement clauses unlawfully conflict with the rights of all workers not only unionized workers to engage in concerted activity on the terms and conditions of their employment source https://hbr.org/2018/01/ndas-are-out-of-control-heres-what-needs-to-change
its a shame that you never got that email from them must have gone right to spam delete ignore whatever
non disclosure does not mean you can t ever talk about working there
leave it up nda mainly most of the time deal with proprietary knowledge if the behavior which he seemed to confirm really happened then it should be shared the non disparage clause in ndas is no longer enforceable it was just recently ruled on if i m not mistaken
shaggy it wasn t me
if you respond with a yes or a no he has evidence that you posted it you might respond with if it was mine i would take it down but it s not mine so i can t sorry
ignore it mufugga ain t gonna spend the money to take it to court
if that joker of an employer had you sign an nda i believe he deserves his shitty review trying to hide he sucks is the norm for crappy employers
nope he has no evidence it s you
nda s believe it or not are not legally binding in some states
never admit to anything and stop responding
i m sorry but i didn t write that review
bloomberg states act to curb employer overuse of non disclosure agreements https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/states-act-to-curb-employer-overuse-of-non-disclosure-agreements)
if they really cared they d bring legal measures in because it s an nda if they re lying about the nda whether it expired or doesn t actually cover this then nothing will happen
it s a trick send no reply send no transmissions of any kind
except for the fact that nlrb said that those non disparagement clauses aren t legal due to it infringing on the right to discuss workplace conditions
do not respond and do not take it down he s guessing it s you you violated nothing if you didn t give specifics which you didn t because he is assuming it s you and doesn t know it was you there is no way for him to prove anything leave it alone
i would suggest ignoring it if you engage with them at all you risk letting something slip even telling them to pound sand could be seen as not denying that it was you unless you get a certified letter from an attorney or served some type of court paperwork i wouldn t bother responding
ignore the shit out of him dude
listen don t acknowledge it was you they are just trying to bully you for a service glass door allows on their platform
i d email them back what lol
leave it up if you remove or edit the review then that will likely confirm to them that it was yours prompting them to sue you for violating the nda by using your delete edit action as proof on the other hand they could ve sent emails worded like yours to all of the previous employees so casting a wide net do nothing and admit nothing until you consult an attorney heck don t even reply or in any way acknowledge receipt with anyone
do nothing say nothing let it ride
i get that ndas are standard in some industries but i would be so hesitant to sign one for a job lol
he s trying to threaten you because your in a severance agreement too bad disparagement clauses aren t enforceable anymore
no doing anything will confirm that it was your review i wouldn t even answer the email
lol no as a matter of fact you should report that to glassdoor and update the review
he has no proof just ignore it you acknowledge it and you have an nda you open yourself up for liability
nda is pretty much non enforceable in just about any circumstance i would just ignore him otherwise as frankly a lawsuit from them would only expose them for their idiotic behavior and give them a ton of negative publicity
i worked at target years ago they acted like giving me a cent raise was amazing such bs
got my review yesterday eight cents after giving my best efforts all year and coming in staying late when asked no raise would have been less hurtful than this is a joke
i will never forget the following two performance reviews i had with my supervisor year supervisor you are the top performer of the team unfortunately you re also at the cap for our salary so we can t give you a raise me okay year supervisor i feel like your performance has dropped off significantly from last year me given that i m at the top end of the salary and not going to get a raise no matter how well i do i wonder why that is
several years ago i was in an annual review meeting where i was told my performance was well above expectations and i would be receiving a raise i made about hr at the time my boss who in all honesty was a good guy i m sure this wasn t his decision just sat back in his chair clearly expecting me to blow up at him instead recognizing the futility of the situation i just said okay he responded aren t you going to try and argue with me over this i asked him would it do any good if i did is this negotiable at all he answered not really what s the point then i said and so i left his office went back to my desk and half assed my way through the rest of my time there
i got a bigger raise from my current job for a cost of living adjustment than three yearly raises in retail retail will never be a respectable line of work because the industry doesn t even respect itself
job hopping often pays off career was always a buzzword now you gotta go where the money is you do toil for the money right
i agree fuck these places after climbing my way to the top as manager to get then get noticed i have a degree i got a raise and a week later they hired a person really close to my wage and at this point i had a full plate and the newbie needed lots of training bullshit proof inflation is faster than wage gain
better than my last job i started at year years ago when i left in january they cut it in half to 90k over the years gradually i hear they are about to do another major cut in july from people that still work there a cent raise is better than a pay cut at least
i once had a boss tell me that i was getting a raise and i was amazed turns out that s because minimum wage was going up by that much he had me convinced for over a year that it was because he was such an amazing boss
i worked for stein mart back when they were still brick and mortar from mid to late i left the company for an arguably worse one after we were gathered for a group meeting and told that they lacked the needed funds for raises i was making hr and was hoping for at least but the hours kept getting cut and stores began closing earlier and earlier they ended up filing for bankruptcy when covid erupted across the us
worked at a target for yrs when i was younger sh t pay and toxic af absolutely hate setting foot in the place
same except me and a lot of other people got told things like well we were going to give you a raise but you were minutes late to your shift a few months ago so you are no longer eligible
what do you mean that s an extra a year
i worked fast food for years during college apart from working during a literal virus outbreak guess what this is about my raises were only hr on top of a we only got bumped to hr due to le pandemic we should have had like hr without going through a once in a lifetime global crisis
i work at walgreens and if my memory serves me right we get at minimum that s not great but i m sure it s at the upper echelon of industry standards
never work any harder than you need to
sheesh what a painful precedent to set
toil
with the loss of union agreements there s no reason to stay with a company longer than you have to when i started in the s in a union job you could work for years and have a guaranteed pension the s and the vultures buying companies to raid their pensions ended that
why would u stay after such disrespect
uh why would anybody take a pay cut i mean i ve never experienced that but to my mind everyone should immediately quit and i do mean everyone
is this even legal i feel like there must be certain ramifications for this i know there s a difference between ethical and legal grievances but ethics still matter
many years ago a friend and colleague of mine was denied a bonus due to being late one day by like or minutes he was so fed up he found another job and it was a big pay bump and nice so he recruited me and about other employees 3rds of the department that cost the company thousands in hiring and training
these reminds me of a recruiter that wouldn t let someone sign an i bc another candidate ran into them with their vehicle in the parking lot and they ended up minutes late while dealing with insurance exchange and calling the cops they apparently have a zero tolerance policy that disqualifies all late applicants there may have been other reasons behind this but it is what i overheard
we had to up the prices by to keep the same profits but oh we can t just get money from anywhere you have to work for peanuts and be happy about it
yeah and then i was told the well you see target didn t meet it s numbers for the year and we can only give out so many higher percentage raises
i ve learned that already being year into the full time job market currently waiting on a task to do hence why i am on reddit and youtube on work hours
yeah they are a huge company with employees i m sure if it was illegal it would have not taken place they would not gamble that for profit in my country usa most states are at will employment they can change or terminate any offer for any reason at any time there are penalties that their insurance covers and they pay a slight premium for wrongful terminations that then in turn pays into unemployment benefits to support the terminated employee but it s all perfectly legal for them
mm this is all too familiar same happened to the staff when i was working for stein mart low profit margins miniscule or non existent raises lol
yes first one would be a great tattoo
thank you
clowns like this guy don t understand that europe does not care to have the biggest and the best company there is we are fine having a good life and a high happiness index without being treated as slaves and expendable at work and still the european union is the 3rd greatest economic power if it is so hostile here why do us companies bother and not stay in their united states of paradise like walmart
treating employees like yesterdays trash how dare the eu deny the googleamazon
damn those europeans and their job protection
i never understand this viewpoint it s like saying slave owning cotton plantations were more profitable than plantations that didn t own slaves what an amazing revelation
how dare they value their fellow man over growth s
go duck yourself edit quack
oh no companies can t hold termination over their heads to force them into submitting to terrible working conditions they actually have to have a reason to fire them other than they refused unreasonable demands therefore they should be fired how sad anyway i hate us based companies they see workers as peasants to make themselves rich instead of as a valued asset that has thoughts feelings and desires of their own
if growth is something you want want in your society but society doesn t recognize the benefits of this growth then you re encouraging the growth of a cancer another way to see it is condoms prevent the growth of stds firefighters prevent the growth of fire and law enforcement prevents the growth of human trafficking healthcare has grown in the us both in cost and as a percentage of gdp over the last years yet the lifespan has gone down so growth is not the automatic positive stance you think it is
ceo s bring the jobs back to america it s so much easier to fire people and deny healthcare
oh no anyway gif
enough stupid people getting that verified check mark is eventually going to make it worthless
the us consistency ranks as number or in employment flexibility among eu and oecd countries this impressive statistic is in part or wholly due to the fact that you have no fucking rights
sounds great to me i live in the country with the biggest gdp in the world and barely any worker protections and it fucking sucks
because an economy can have it all happy workers and good industry you just have to regulate what the arseholes can get away with in the name of profit
if it is so hostile here why do us companies bother and not stay in their united states of paradise like walmart because they can pay europeans less than of the cost of employees in the us a senior swe for google in germany makes usd in france usd that same person working in the us makes when i left g years ago i was making more than europeans or levels above me and i wasn t working in one of the high cost of living areas in fact its below national avg cost of living i bought my house the year i started working there and it cost less than my first year salary
no you have to support slave companies and rich people right now it hurts you but when you re rich you can have slaves making money for you s
fvck plantations and its landlords viva castros che cienfuegos and others
okay but if you re an ordinary person that doesn t have to worry about dropping two years of salary for an unavoidable medical emergency how does it look
as a worker i am in full agreement with you but to the corporation that doesn t really have any impact on the decision to hire workers
i ve never had more than 10k as my max out of pocket expense for my insurance the median american worker has better insurance than that
i am in no way interested about the wellbeing of corporations if they all go bankrupt tomorrow and have to sell their assets to smaller companies and family businesses i would not shed a single tear
it s meaningful both that most americans would go 10k in debt over a 10k expense and that there are still people with worse coverage
the question i was replying to was why do us companies so you are going off topic you are just going off on a tangent
the average u s employee paid out of pocket before hitting their deductible coverage quality is indeed all over the place
yeah people are just realizing that most things we hear about life and jobs are bs hopefully bs is promoted by people who want everything to stay as is
there is no reason the overwhelming majority of jobs in the year should be anywhere near 40hr week we need to get to asap to help alleviate a lot of problems that we have
ceos making million profits in the billions and thousands of employees struggling with poverty and living on welfare should be alarming to people and make them furious but it doesn t at least not enough of us when someone hears x company made billion in profit how are they not hearing millions of dollars of employee wages stolen
we re not going to be happy until we unionize kick the corpos in the teeth and regain some semblance of the lifestyle that boomers and gen x took for granted as being theirs
america has been on a downhill trajectory for some time now the system has worked exactly as planned for a select few the rich are now too powerful and protected for us to try and even the playing field we are on our way out while the oligarchs retreat to their island villas
pandemic made a lot of people realize just how far modern slavery is permitted to go by our overlords not the people
the other are extremely unhappy and struggling just to keep their heads above water the last are laughing their way to the bank after skimming a hefty chunk off the top of the profits the made for them
only half
making others rich will do that to you
that s because work used to be fulfilling taking pride in your work used to be a real thing now corporate america is filled with despair covid proved to everyone that corporate america was the dystopian reality that we all knew it was instead of working to get ahead we work just enough to be ready for the next company there are no promotions and no raises just more work all that matters to the greedy boomers is the quarterly profits they don t care about the future they will be gone by then
capitalism must be destroyed
as some just slightly too old to be a millennial i ll let you in on the secret we ve never been happy but we were raised and then managed by the boomers not to expect happiness that s why it s called work that s why you re paid to do it it hasn t been until the more recent population shift and the arrival of reinforcements that workers have been in a position to demand more even now the stockholm syndrome is so ingrained in me that i feel anxious and guilty when i use my vacation time or call in sick the greatest generation understood worker rights and unions the boomers set everything back years
hey dipshits in the media and corporate ass clowns it will never fucking stop
i mean look at everything is there any wonder why
anti work is the wrong phrase the vast majority of people want to do a whole ass lot of work for themselves their communities etc but we live in a system that employs slavery to produce goods and services so we are opposed to being slaves not working no surprise we are then given a narrative that we just don t want to work anymore which is a lot less damaging to the ruling class than admit those of us that have to work are slaves the slaves produce the surplus the master takes the serfs produce the surplus the lord takes the workers produce the surplus the owner takes it used to be divine rule that gave kings the right to be the master instead of slave and now we have the equally fake system of meritocracy why would anyone want to perpetuate a system like that
and the other half are unemployed or retired
have you guys seen the cost for the 4pk of redbull used to be now it s for the same pack hate it everything is an extra grocery shopping is a nightmare now and don t get me started on gas prices going back up after going down for a little while like what s up with all the fluctuating prices
i am glad the retirer me early because of substances i say the pidmie years ago i was gonna go into robotics to upkeep robots that are doing most of the work everybody went on line with banking shopping food i just added my dbit card online who own s majority of the business in north america most have also outsources overseas this should never been allowed you sell in canada and they does not go back to pay canadien employes it goes overseas and oay salaris and the rest invested by the company i dont get much pension but i have  husband and together i think we ll be able but i can t splurge i am so sorry this is happening
no shit i know my pay hasn t been adjusted for inflation
working to make enough to continue being able to work
look at the labor laws in some of the happiest countries lots like night and day
as anti work trend continues yet certain elements of reddit wont get tired to tell us how this movement is dying
watched the whole american world be exposed as arbitrary bullshit in and people are just being forced to get back into it it s stupid
as an american who moved to western europe last year i can attest to how much less stressful my life is i don t even work but i will at some point
from denis leary happiness comes in small doses folks it s a cigarette butt or a chocolate chip cookie or a five second orgasm you come you smoke the butt you eat the cookie you go to sleep wake up and go back to f ing work the next morning that s it end of f ing list
ok everyone gather around we have to vote on which member of the mod team we are sacrificing to the media this time
we need to push for a day work week at every sector agreed
if ot weren t taxed i d bet my left nut more people would be happy to go to work
op did you change the title or was this the original one and did fortune change it because the wording is like the anti work trend is causing the unhappiness
ever wonder if the antiwork trend is an astroturf psyops to fix the ecconomy without crashing the stock market got to bring the damand down so you can raise rates until the layoffs begin or you can convince people to quit so you don t have to raise rates to get the desired result
hate to break it to you guys i m in the ibew and even in the union things like working through breaks working way more than a and being treated like crap by superiors are becoming a norm
fuck it
i mean look at everything the country is a wreck people can t afford to live let alone enjoy anything or look forward to anything i don t make enough to afford a shanty in my area i literally just work to work and it s like running on a hamster wheel it s getting me nowhere other than paying for rent and groceries you used to be able to link working to bigger goals in life like buying a house investing having a family even affording a vacation home at some point or even a vacation twice a year with all the transplants and retirees moving here and raising the price of homes plus employers underpaying i ll never afford a house or children i ve lost all interest in dating or doing much of anything because nothing is feasible for me i m running in place and there s not even a carrot being dangled in front of me just air
keep up the good anti work
anti work trend we made it
the subreddit gains more subscribers everyday it s amazing and beautiful
imagine not being happy at poverty pay workplace bullying and unreasonable demands
checks out likely in most of the westernized world capitalism will fall it s only a matter of time
lol those interest rates are really helping us out fucking pathetic economic policy to protect the wealthy what a shitty scam this country is
i currently work hour days at a beverage production facility and it is killing me i just found out today that they want to move us to 12s and i have no idea if i can do it the funny thing is the people in the office are rarely here for full hours a day and they are never here on the weekends also i work the night shift and when i need to take a day off to get shit done they try to tell me well you re off when things are open so you should be able to get it done and i m like oh ok so fuck sleep i guess
anti work as no jobs available because the computer simulation has replaced us
does a pizza supper would help
you aren t happy because you re doing nothing with your life
are we finally recovering from the u abolishwork fiasco
it s basic sociology and history resources are limited pay power etc there are environmental concerns and the masses are starting to go into survival mode violence theft anger it all ties back rebalance the seesaw and work on the environment crime will reduce abuse will reduce hunger will reduce homelessness will reduce mental and physical health will improve a stronger smarter healthier workforce or keep the seesaw imbalanced and the negatives will increase
also promoted by the people that got brain washed by it
ive definitely felt this us work culture is a scam and needs to change first with fewer hours max
not happy i have a good job and i am fucking furious with how shitty my life is fuck this
getting down to is my dream
this but a revamp on the economy has to happen as a whole as well prices need to adjust accordingly to how much people are then being paid with stricter regulations regarding price gauging will the government ever do this no
a livable wage with hrs would be nice i don t want to work two jobs forever just to get by it s ridiculous
i ask myself this same thing
yeah i feel like that s a messaging issue with the left we hyper focus on the moral right to housing healthcare food etc and then on to environment and equality which is good but we never lead with just the basic fact that their money is not their money it is ours simple it should be the established bedrock fact of any discussion around wages and wealth if isn t established then the rich and their defenders get to discuss the issues as if we re trying to take their money when in reality we are arguing about money that was taken from workers profit is theft
is such a thing even possible in a world that must degrow its economy if it hopes to stave off complete ecological collapse the standard of living in the global south must be raised though i don t know if the global north could hope to retain all its luxuries a healthy lifestyle is decidedly not the kind the generations before us indulged in the lint on our clothes contains carcinogenic microplastics gas stoves are a multifaceted health risk north american cities are designed around the automobile all are fundamentally unsustainable we need a more accessible society for disabled people as well as one less dependent on both low wage labour and redundant appliances
i m a little torn here as a gen x i m mildly pleased to be included but definitely pissed about being lumped in with the boomers we ain t got shit
yes
gex x never had that position trust me source gen xer
sharpen your pitchfork i ve got mine
shrinkflation is also more rampant and bullshit with inflation and grocery prices going up at a time when people are struggling my regular toothpaste shrunk two times and the price went up switching toothpaste but this is an unnecessary burden on people trying to work and make ends meet seriously they going to shrink my toothpaste to preserve profits yeah fuck p and g
your time will come but it never comes but the person saying it improves his her life ps and they say that sh t like they are some character from lotr
i have said it before but there is just absolutely no reason for billionaires to exist period every single penny over straight to taxes and that includes assets you hit a billion we give you a modest statue and throw a short parade you made it you won the game of life you make over a billion and want to give it to your kids sure why not make as many people almost billionaires as possible but you don t get to be a billionaire period
the young people somethings in my life cannot be fulfilled or take pride in their work when that work even if full time and professional will not pay for their basic needs they see no hope of ever owning a home or being in a position of anything but indentured servitude the idea of raising a family is understood by them to be only a means to a life of corporate slavery in order to support said family the cannot get ahead because rent will always be due because the ownership class is no longer the middle class e spelling
you sound like my parents my mom is vehemently anti union and lets her vacation and sick days accumulate my dad worked himself to death and wound up with not much to fall back on needless to say i am a high performance worker but i still love the hell out of my wfh situation and vacation time i learned early on in my career that there is no such thing anymore as worker appreciation and the only way to get the raises you deserve is by moving to another company
nicely said and accurate i too am of your age range and feel exactly the same i am embarrassed by my decades of regurgitating quotes like you have written due to my younger self s workplace and educational brainwashing
or as my old boss used to say if you re enjoying your job you probably aren t doing it right
even now the stockholm syndrome is so ingrained in me that i feel anxious and guilty when i use my vacation time or call in sick this is one the worst feelings in my adult life like you i recognize that it s a messed up response to have but i can t help it that is my physical feeling the sinking stomach pit etc ugh
i got gas today it went up from last week
the price on granola got real wackadoodles fast used to be for a 16oz pack but now it s for a 12oz pack anyway i started making my own for a lot less but the shrinkflation is the weirder one for me
yes the outsourcing really should have been outlawed the corporate structure is t9tally imbalanced am glad you got a pension 401k inus are another way corporate structure screws the worker
it auto picked the title
so being exploited at a shitty company with a shitty manager is what you people consider doing something with one s life got it
speak up for the kids in the back
older generations have fucked us over and are still trying to fuck us more that s what s happening
first with a living wage but then yes fewer hours to reflect the thousand percent increase in productivity we have achieved through the industrial and then computer revolutions
mine dream as well i have always been i work as a tech in media so it is normal not good good luck to you
right i work a salary position i usually work every week even though im only paid for
it depends what you mean by quality of life can we still buy an insane amount of goods for next to nothing no not without exploiting the environment and the third world can we revert housing back to the point that people can rent without losing of their paycheck yes can we revert business back to a state where it isn t completely dominated by a small number of corps maybe can we revert back to a time where workers aren t expected to work random hours at no notice or ridiculously long hours with no vacation yes very easily
ok but have you considered that the rich won t make as much money if we do that what s a few billion lives for profit
i m also gen x and literally about days ago i was just telling my gen z son how back in college early 90s we saw a lot of articles about gen x vs the boomers and then about years later we started seeing millennials vs the boomers and now we are starting to see zoomers vs the boomers i m noticing a pattern
it s because a lot of your generation has sold out and never got past the radlib phase my brother fashions himself as a socialist but he still succumbs to tds and flogs himself for biden likewise a lot of his friends got paid during the com boom and just act like dipshit libs a lot of your generation has been firmly integrated into modern norms my other brother s best friend legit sent me a cia podcast sponsored by palantir on the the war on ukraine you are fine sounding but your generation by and large has no respect from me
yep it is boomers fucking up the place a few gen x and about three millennials but mostly fuckin boomers
can confirm another gen xer
did you know that if you use the word that starts with a g that cuts people s heads off reddit gets very upset lol i learned my lesson hahahaha i got a ban for saying bring out the g
shrinkflation aw that s just another word for robbery shaq s dad
was stocking shelves the other day upc didn t line up with the tag i read the tag and it was supposed to be a pack of granola bars the new box is a value pack assigned to the home now same sized box it s half empty
as one of the unfortunates who work for them i agree with your last sentence
my mom notes this with bacon we all know where that money is going
the one thing that bothers me about this and always has is assuming the government would be a good steward of that tax harvest straight to taxes to then not be used to help people out with shit lol government is all too happy to not redistribute a goddamn thing as it is
oh i m way lower than that you got a paid off house worth up to million million and you don t need any more money it s the next persons turn
either you ssy this on millions of posts or your copy pasta ing and claiming ownership of unoriginal thoughts
you start a company it s initially worth nothing then it becomes successful and your is now nominally worth 2bn and you re restricted from selling shares what exactly do you propose happen in this situation the government takes half of your stock and ends up owning essentially all private companies in time i always find these proposals very ignorant like you re imagining that billionaires have a vault of gold like scrooge mcduck or something
how would you tax that nobody really has a billion in cash it s generally in the market or scattered across bank accounts when people talk about how much someone is worth they are talking about the amount of shares they have at what price not what they have in the bank they can actually get out also by the time you are making a few million and have significant assets depending on what you are doing what you would generally do is just take leans against your assets and pay it off with dividends or by selling some shares you don t have to pay tax on that also and most important putting a static number into law isn t my favorite thing like minimum wage is super low because it s set as a static number so if we went through super high inflation lots of people would kinda jump up to be a billionare and while it would still be very rich people so not that big of a deal you kinda have to think about the change of inflation and the worth of a billion usd
even if full time and professional will not pay for their basic needs it didn t use to be that way that s what the boomers did they fucked the system it worked pretty good for them but they went scorched earth on everyone younger and yet they don t seem to comprehend what they did in search of every penny of extra quarterly profits
i m certainly not anti union
also how come wendy s can still have the for on their menu but mcdonald s can t keep their prices low
yeah so again made to look as if the trend of workers being vocal and aware about problems around the workplace causee the unhappiness
when there are generational shift the question of free will is questioned of people here would not have the same thoughts ideas and values if they were born years ago and let us not talk about the new entitled me generation of narcissism that will be the new poision we have just as much of a fixing against our other extreme of our generation that i think might be just as awful in many ways
always have been
oh my fellow media person them hours days suck it out of you
laughs in hour weeks at understaffed state prison then cries because i can t afford to quit for a few more months
i read that as old people cant afford to retire and are the only ones desperate enough to take shit jobs for shit pay
they didn t mind getting exploited their entire life anyway
well some people from older generations seem to believe it is a virtue to die from hard work the only problem is that this culture won t last
there may be some truth to this but it s only because the older generation was lucky enough to live through a time where hard work really did pay off that s no longer true and the old folks are in for a serious wake up call it s only a matter of time before they figure out they re being exploited
all the olds in my company are incompetent and can t work in a digital age

we recently got that same we re family speech absolute worst if we are family how about sharing equity in the company with me and all my brothers and sisters so we can take it over when you are gone just like a good founding father would want
i want a divorce i am going out for cigarettes be back
i have a handful of co workers i can consider to be friends i have never viewed a co worker as part of a family
fuck that i already have a family and unfortunately i spend much less time with them than i do with my coworkers people who say shit like that have empty meaningless lives and they try to fill that void by working long hours and expecting their coworkers employees to do the same no thank you fuck off
yeah cause people working at the same place can t be nice to each other it s either you are enslaved or you are nice you can t be both dont worry i m certain they don t talk about you when they say that you sound like a nice person to work with
what kind of family is that exactly the kind of family that exploits you underpays you demeans and harasses you and then threatens you with expulsion or detention in an ice facility if you dare talk
really have to look at the level you re hearing it from your floor manager in retail is just trying to be nice and make people feel included at a job they have to be there in close proximity for hours if the ceo on the other hands starts talking like this then you have all the grievance in the world one has the power to change structures one is just getting through the day like you
a real family member would want what s best for me emotionally and financially without making it about themselves
lmao one time when a call center manager said this i laughed out loud and said yeah a dysfunctional one
i have friends and work friends i e people i m friendly with at work but don t go out of my way to be friends with on my own time i had those at my old fast food job but very few if any i kept in touch with regularly after leaving that job
ummm this was ment to express that exact sentiment it s a huge red flag for an employer i agree with you fully the title is sarcastic
hahaha yeah i got your sarcasm i wasn t telling you to fuck off i was telling the concept of coworkers as family to fuck off sorry if it came off the wrong way
my bad lol i initially read the tone wrong no worries
an audit is just some 3rd party association that verifies the paperwork and that the numbers add up according to the laws of wherever you are if they find missing shit they need to either fix it find it or they get fined
the audit is going to show just how much wage left has been going on odds are someone is embezzling and going to lose their job depending on the state you live in they are going to have to pay more than they shorted you and fines with some luck someone may even go to prison
hey im accounts payable and deal with that shit all the time if you have any info you can send the school district with specific documents or where to look like your summer pay they are going to get them crawling all over their asses and its gonna be amazing
hopefully shit will hit the fan wait and watch
really oh she s definitely going to get fined then the guy that sent the audit told me that her numbers don t add up that s why she s receiving the audit that s good to know thx
hopefully
it s also against the law for you to not have access to your paystubs even if you have direct deposit they should be mailed to you or emailed to you or something
update us too please
oh i will

when we see ourselves as fighting against specific human beings rather than social phenomena it becomes more difficult to recognize the ways that we ourselves participate in those phenomena we externalize the problem as something outside ourselves personifying it as an enemy that can be sacrificed to symbolically cleanse ourselves against the logic of the guillotine https://crimethinc.com/2019/04/08/against-the-logic-of-the-guillotine-why-the-paris-commune-burned-the-guillotine-and-we-should-too)** see rule no calls for violence no fetishizing violence no guillotine jokes no gulag jokes i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r antiwork if you have any questions or concerns
i retired months ago and can tell you i have not been bored at all i sure as shit don t miss work
it s because at least in the u s a many of us have been raised to believe that our work defines us from being a milk helper in kindergarten to getting work co op credits in high school we ve been taught that life and work are linked in deeper ways than just a way to feed oneself then as adults we are told to find out passion or calling which is always something like teaching medicine accounting etc and mostly pushed away from the things that we love but can t support oursleves with this doesn t accounts for everyone but it is the norm for many which also explains why so many when finally able to retire don t they can t wrap their heads around life without having work to give them purpose just an opinion based on almost years working
we have been culturally conditioned to believe there is such a thing as boredom in reality we re overly stimulated in unwholesome ways and don t know what to do when we have to sit with the dissonance people should be allowed to be bored now and then
some people are brainwashed to believe that their value comes from having a full time job even with money it s not enough the guilt around enjoying their existence keeps them trapped perfect brainwashing
this is how i felt during the pandemic when i was still going to work everyday but all my friends were just sitting at home complaining about being bored like i can think of a hundred things i could have done with that time my husband and i both work in restaurants his temporarily closed down and put everyone on unemployment mine stayed open i d come home to him complaining about being bored when i d spent all day getting screamed at about masks or not allowing people to dine in even though it was literally the law that we had to be to go only or asking people to stand in designated spots one day i blew up at him telling him how we have entire bookshelves full of books we haven t read yet that i would love to read or how we spent money on binoculars and a bird identification app so he could bird watch like he said he wanted to we have a switch and games he could play to his hearts content he could have the laundry done and dinner made without me having to think about it when i got home we have painting and art supplies out the ass he s always wanted to watercolor he could start actually learning any of the different things his adhd brain has shown interest in he could learn spanish like he d been saying he wanted to for years hell just being able to relax for an extended period of time like sooo many things we always say we want to do but don t have time for but then people suddenly have all the time in the world and it s booo there s nothing to do i would have thrived being stuck at home not having any kind of work or social obligations but i was one of just a handful of people in my social circles still having to go to work it was like a cruel joke i m glad that we had money coming in and didn t have to worry about falling behind financially and that my job was doing everything possible to keep us safe so we never got covid but damn was it frustrating even worse when i think about all the people in healthcare working insane shifts and actually dying i bet they have some choice words for all those bored people too
anyone who says that is coming from a perspective of having no job but also no money
i think there are some people who define themselves by their profession those are the people who worry about being bored after retirement my dad retired and within a few months he said he couldn t figure out how he fit a hour work week into his schedule
my kids are on break now and i can take them to museums or to get icees in the middle of the day we can go to the park after school gardening is starting to pick up because it s getting warmer i can make bread or read there is literally no shortage of things for me to do around the house
as much as i understand that the amount of pain and suffering is not worth it this is why i miss i picked up over half a dozen skills caught up on every anime tv series and book series i wanted to grew my own food connected with my wife even more helped a roomie get over their family issues lost lbs and actually refined my writing a bit there s so much i could do if i wasn t shackled to a job
boredom is in the eye of the beholder one persons hell is boredom the other persons boredom is freedom i would give anything to be bored and have nothing to do anything
looking back the two months i was on unemployment beause of the covid lock down were the best of my adult life the first week was stressful but after unemployemnt went through and i got a safe rotunie to go grocery shopping i really enjoyed my time we completed house projects we never thought we get done we ate together every night didn t waste food cause we had time to plan meals i became a morning person i never was one before or since i didn t get tired or draged down in the afternoon i still rember my heart sinking when i got that email saying congratulations were opening back up sooner than we expected it was mostly fear of getting sick and my family sick but also thinking of all the other projects still wanted to get done then my job gave me around hours so i wouldn t qualify for unemployment so i got a second one then they moved me back to full time life just moves so fast now sorry for the rambling and poor gramer
because without funds to pay for these things it s hella bad i m disabled i ve been there without a source of money enough to pay for these things not having a job is hell on earth
i m dealing with this now i m about to go on long term disability for cancer i m still healthy but need lots of time off for chemo so i have the prospect of retiring when i was diagnosed at thought i d never get to but it s weird i hate working always have but i am a bit nervous about finding things to do first off hobbies cost money and i ll be getting less on disability so that s an issue but there s something else at play i never had my identity tied with my job i clocked in worked clocked out that s it but being told you can t work anymore doesn t feel right somehow maybe it s because i m not choosing it i worry without deadlines or a reason to do something i just kinda won t like in school i d never get a paper done if there wasn t a due date kind of thing maybe it s the structure and routine that a job provided i don t know i m trying to figure it out i hate working i should be happy i m being forced into retirement in two months
yeah these people have no hobbies or lives i can sit on my ass every day for hours and hours for years doing nothing but watching anime and playing video games if i get bored of that i enjoy swimming biking goong to the gym playing basketball eating and drinking out and a zillion other fucking things that have nothing to do with working
i would just seriously clean my house for like a month straight i used to be a sahm and now i don t have the time keep it up to the same standard i did back then and it drives me nuts at least i can listen to audiobooks at work but there s definitely no time for hobbies
stuck at home for a week from covid i sure as hell spent a lot of time thinking about all the things i could and should be doing whilst bedridden if i didn t have work my productivity would just change tasks
people might just create things for the fun of it art video games software they wouldn t be confined by the necessary to live i d love to just repair circuits when i m not fine tuning my battle station learning ham radio and hiking
those who say that are so conditioned to not having any time for themselves they literally can t imagine a life filled with time because whenever they do happen to have an extra hour or two they are genuinely bored probably due to their lack of hobbies interests outside of their job or they re just saying that because they think that s what whoever they re talking to wants to hear
i m getting my gallbladder out later today i m looking forward to my couple weeks off
i m more bored at work than i could ever be at home obviously have to have some money to finance my activities at home but i m not giving work any more hours than i have to
if everybody were unemployed tomorrow i e guaranteed income we d see a massive increase in creativity arts music etc because people who are currently exhausting themselves to survive could apply themselves to higher things yeah fine some people would f off all day but many would not
i stopped working from october to february this past year i got extremely depressed i did not do any of the things you laid out going back to work after getting on an ssri has helped me it s not even boredom it s soul crushing time spent not having a reason to get out of bed
i think it s becusee we re so conditioned to work that we wouldn t know what to do with ourselves if we don t
i have so many hobbies i d like to be able to dedicate more time to i d work out everyday starting playing guitar again spend more time in nature man the dream
it totally baffles me too in all the extended times when i was without a job i never got bored because there were so many interesting things to do great books to read cool projects to get involved in
i quit my job about a year ago after recovering from the burnout i started taking some college classes while working part time on campus to buy myself time to figure out a gameplan getting to take college classes without the stress of working towards a particular degree was actually really relaxing i m pretty sure that if i didn t need money i d sign up for a class or two every semester and just keep taking classes until i ran out of interesting classes to take mix that in with a few other hobbies and i would have plenty of interesting things to occupy my time
i had a job where the manager didn t get the concept of having a life outside of work i worked 10am 10pm monday through friday one week we were supposed to inventory the client s equipment which is a job that takes about hours with a staff of that week we had practically nothing to do in the evenings we need to come in saturday to do the inventory why can t we just split it up over the next few nights so we don t have to come in on the weekend there s nothing going on otherwise what do you have to do that s so important on the weekend not be here we ended up coming in saturday
i retired about months ago i don t miss work that s for sure but it is hard to get to those things you want to do for me it s the negative feedback loop i don t do anything so i don t feel like doing anything then i don t do anything it takes a certain amount of discipline
a while back i started a new job and due to a mixup i wasn t on any projects for about weeks i was working from home and had tasks at work each day consisted of me sending an email to my boss and getting told nothing yet just hang tight some friends family comments were along the lines that sucks you must have been so bored and wow i would have gone insane after days boredom was the exact opposite of what i was feeling there was just sooo much i could and did do i rode my bike around i started gardening i played video games i practiced cooking i made pottery from scratch i hiked i exercised and so on there s a million things in this world to keep us entertained
only boring people get easily bored
i hate when people start competing about how bored they get at home in the same brainwashed way that people compete about working the most hours or sleeping the least amount i worked hours last week oh yeah well i worked i only need hours of sleep a night yeah well i only need five hours ugh i had to call out last week and i was so bored by the third day i know what you mean i can t have more than one day off or i go absolutely stir crazy like it s all capitalist brain washing to compete for being the most cog like in the system
i am on a path to retire in my early 50s about years from now i mentioned this to a similarly aged friend and that was her reaction why would you retire that young what would you do i didn t even know how to answer it s like enjoy life do hobbies go on walks just because
i d assume most people who say that probably would be bored because they generally don t have hobbies or activities they enjoy outside of work enough to fill the time or probably a bit more accurately they have so little time already for their lives outside of work hours they don t have enough time to discover hobbies or activities they d enjoy doing outside of work so they can t imagine what they d do to fill their time i know for me i have a very regular work schedule but i still have a hard time coming up with things for me to do outside of work hours that aren t video games and watching tv but i ve started doing more puzzles getting back into reading books bought some lego sets and have been painting mini paintings and dnd miniatures not to mention trying new places to eat and shop especially cafes
i retired in have yet to be bored we don t even travel much i read books per year
i would definitely still work if i wasn t employed i like carpentry and woodworking and working on cars and painting and lots of stuff i even like helping other people work on things i do kinda hate being forced to get up every day so some stock owners can get rich off my work and so that a bank can make money on taking care of my money and take interest on my mortgage and i hate commercials and ads and products that exist only for consuming and planned obsolesence
living on disability reading books including textbooks because i m a nerd discovering new bands meeting people studying in various academic areas learning horticulture teaching myself how to write improving my cooking skills with recipes from around the world becoming a coffee snob and operating on my own schedule sleeping eating exercising socializing is that wasting time for a while i was a good friend and a full time activist who had fun memento vivere remember to live
i never get that argument either those people lack imagination and basic joy in life
i m retired time just flies by
i m an in home care nurse for my brother we do at home dialysis it s a almost full time job still gives me full days off and tons of downtime during treatment i can internet or read or knit a wierd new hobby plus it s almost outdoor season here even with all my free time i don t have enough to explore or build or grow or learn about all that interests me
i live abroad after escaping the us i work hours a week over two days for full time benefits and decent pay i even get a pension if i stay long enough if i m bored i do something or learn something i definitely don t do more work because it doesn t define me or interest me i have friends and whatnot that have told me that they would use all this extra time to grind out a lot of money and retire early i told them i m basically retired now why do all that extra shit just to get to where i am now anyway other posters are totally right people are brainwashed to think the number in their bank account means anything and they re willing to trade the healthy part of their lives to see the number go up
my best friend leads a very simple life he just went back to work part time after taking almost years off he gave up the corporate life years ago and is very happy he has no stress and works when he wants if he wants there s something to be said for rejecting consumerism and living life on you own terms
those people spend of their energy on work come home only to eat and sleep asks do it again they can t imagine activities outside of work because they never do them
one of these days i ll get to the scrapbooking photography and crafts i keep telling myself i ll do but never get around to i ve always found people whose entire personality and life is their work to be really strange unless they created the company or are really passionate about this particular job subject but these people are rare
if you like cooking and reading you can easily keep yourself entertained no problem
i had cancer for two years where i was on disability through my work i will never ever ever get to have that much time off from work ever again and i wouldn t want it cause i enjoy being healthy but literally the best time of my life not getting up for my for years i would take cancer again if it ment not having to work just sucks cause i went into debt hard to live when you get after bills and are too sick to do any side gigs etc
because of disability i ve been largely unemployed for many years i have hobbies many hobbies in the words of that lion king song more to do than can ever be done i still wish i had more time in the day even now
i hate that even when i have free time it is tainted by the knowledge that in days i am right back to work it makes it hard to really relax and focus on long term hobbies and goals
when asked that question ask them back if they have any imagination x200b if they cannot seriously think of activities and things to do they ve lost all imagination and cannot think outside their cage these people have a form of stockholm syndrome where they think work is a necessary activity in order to fill up their day because work is the only thing they ve been taught through years of modern slavery
people who have there whole identity based of their job career say this i work to pay for shit i need and want not because i would be bored or want too
i think most people who say that struggle with having a solid identity they have made their job and their coworkers into their identity they re the people who stay late and stress themselves out for the company people are so incredibly distracted and when you don t have a real identity and you stop being distracted then it s existential crisis time and nobody wants that i think that s why so many people are fine with keeping on keeping on with horrible jobs
medically retired at or some sort of hiatus for a couple years to figure things out the amount of freedom i have now is unreal sure i get bored some days like anyone else might but overall i m pretty much a always finding some way to spend my time that feels like i m doing something i find personally fulfilling if i do end up managing to make my way back into the workforce i m hoping i can make a living with photography or some other artistic pursuit
the only time i m ever bored is when i m waiting for something like to leave for an appointment or my friends are meeting at my place before we go out when i have absolutely nothing to do i m the happiest clam there is because i ll exercise read catch up on tv shows play video games go for walks around town like i love having an open schedule
i haven t worked for a bit over a year now not entirely by choice and i can verify that while sometimes i do occasionally get bored i do not wish i d rather be working i ve been able to complete projects around the house spend time with my baby help my wife more with chores and errands be able to plan weekend activities etc having one income in my personal situation is a major stressor as we re living paycheck to paycheck now so i ve been applying over applications out this year already and only one interview but man i m not looking forward to going back to work
your life has to be pretty terrible if working is the only entertaining interesting thing you have to do
i was one of those people who thought retirement would be boring then my lifelong arthritis got me good and i needed hip replacement at a relatively young age and rehab took forevvvvvvvver except for the physical pain i absolutely loved having all of my time be my own so when i ended up having to take early retirement five years later i wasn t bothered at all i get up when i want do what i want at whatever time i want and go to bed when i m sleepy
my mother in law lives in ottawa canada and has worked for the govt since the s she s been able to retire with her full pension for years and she won t do it because what would i do all day umm i don t know literally anything you felt like doing whenever you want to do it this woman is working every day just because she doesn t have a hobby or thinks she will be bored how about get a fucking hobby then travel join a book club think about all the things in life you wishes you had the money and time to do and do them i get so annoyed that she continues to waste the good years of her life working because she would probably be bored after a week millions of people out there would kill to have had the security of a million dollar pension and the ability to retire at years old
i would rather be bored than have to work
i agree and don t understand that mentality at all i always hear people wanting to work worried about being bored when not working wanting to get back to work etc and it doesn t even compute in my head the only way i can rationalize it is that these people either don t like their home life or do really like their job or both i highly dislike work and love my home life so i guess that s why i just won t ever understand it to me life is way too short to even consider the idea of being too bored if not working
always winds me up when people say they would still work if they won the lottery yeah well you re a fucking idiot then
i d love to just spend time being with my family i spend most of it working and sleeping and i genuine think working overnights is lowering my lifespan
as someone that actually enjoys their job first job in my life i have felt this way i would still rather be at home with my family i would venture to say i even love my job but again not more then spending time with my family if you would rather be working then not you either have no hobbies or no family
my mum says this to me some of my coworkers have said this i want to slap them do some people have no creative incentive in their mind what so ever that is incomprehensible to me i could take several years off work doing almost nothing but playing video games and be happy with that and that s not even touching the creative things i want to explore
i love hitting the ones with kids with you wouldn t spend more time with family and watching them backtrack or double down on being the type of person i should avoid
i feel this in my soul when people ask me what i want to do i never have an answer because lots of things isn t an acceptable answer i have several weird completely different passions in my life and i just don t think i m wired for a career mindset i ve had hobbies that make money but as soon as it becomes a job i stop wanting to do it i can only truly enjoy things when i m doing them solely for my enjoyment and nothing else i would be content waking up and just working on what my heart desires around the house i found something i can tolerate raise a family on and focus my energy on what i do in my free time i ve seen countless people work their whole lives to be let go years before retirement they don t care about you stop caring so much about them
retire every day is saturday
i was going to say that my understanding of this is that work is stuff like hobbies and reading and learning and all that so yeah people want to work and do things but i see that most people who complain that people don t want to work are not arguing about this specifically not wanting to do activities that require energy being spent but that they literally want people to do work even if its detrimental to them because they genuinely think that that s all you need no fulfillment no personal growth no anything but that you just need to keep working i use to approach them with anger and annoyance that they do not understand now i approach them with pity and sadness it hits the people meant to understand and annoys the ones who are being difficult win win in my books
part of it is the loneliness more than an actual boredom i was laid off back during the great recession and did my best to keep myself busy like you said the first month was amazing or so then it became like i was disconnected from the world if that makes sense i would wake up late no one would be home spend my day reading or watching tv maybe texting a little bit then after work everyone would be back and talk about their day but i didn t really have anything to mention while i didn t miss work i was super happy when i started to attend graduate school because it felt like i was rejoining the world
i think that lots of people never have the time to fully self actualize and look inwardly as to what they want to do be beyond their work career a few days back there was an askreddit thread titled something like how do you balance life with a and a few of the top replies had people literally having hours of free time after weekdays and it wasn t framed in a context of necessity follow ups of what all is there even to do it s sad when people are stuck on the lower levels of maslow s hierarchy of needs esp in developing countries but it s also really bleak when people seem to willingly do so i did the math on the hours of free time folks and assuming they have hours of free time on saturday and sunday after errands chores that s a total of hours out of a week that s for them their so and any family friends of their entire life that s free and most of it is centralized on two days off for five days of the week they only have of their time for themselves their so etc 120h even with a h a week and a minute commute i have to round robin my hobbies every week or two i d probably need to go down to hours a week to be able to do a little of everything i want to do each week
i make it a priority to take as much time off as possible i am never board and out side of the excess drinking to forget my job i always enjoy my time off
it depends on your financial situation if i had time off and a ton of money to travel and do whatever i wanted i d be on cloud but i was laid off last winter for months from a job i really disliked and i was depressed by about day barely making ends meet so i had to force myself to seek out free stuff to do just to get me out of my pajamas i ended up trying a ton of different recipes and i was cooking and baking every day the last month of it
been doing my job for years its not a great job by any stretch but it can be challenging and the challenges are fun i have lots of hobbies for my free time but without the job i dont have money for my hobbies so then yes id been bored out of my mind without having my disposable cash
so boredom comes in because you don t have any money you might have time but the ability to live without the devastation of no income creates boredom
my house would be so fucking clean and organized if i didn t work full time
i actually like working and do get bored if i m just relaxing instead but you don t have to work for someone else to work carving wood is work making a website is work mowing lawns is work but if you re mowing your lawn making your own website carving your own lil figures that s all energizing enjoyable work there s something about doing work for someone else that makes work suck way more
i just got through a year long cancer treatment that ended with a divorce after that i quit my job and this past year has been the least boring of my entire life
i d be bored if i had no money to go anywhere or buy things need a job to be able to have the money for some types of hobbies and travel
my job isn t too terrible and i have hobbies outside of work people who say that sort of thing are just stupid
i was fortunate enough to retire a little more than three years ago i will turn in a few weeks don t miss working not one bit
literally my favorite time is when i m forced to stay home because i test positive for covid and get time to clean my house take care of my hygiene cook all my meals catch up on shows i like work out etc
people who say they wouldn t know what to do if they retired need some freaking hobbies
whenever i m on a layoff i always wonder when i get back to work how i have the time for work when i ve got so many important things to do
ex coworker s dad who was a systems engineer came back to work after his retirement as a part time contractor when asked why he said because if i don t the only thing i would do all day is sit around and read i was like dude yeah that s the dream
i ve been on short term disability lately due to a surgery and yeah i agree i ve been practicing drawing every day and actually improving and having fun i ve been writing and designing my own ttrpg making good progress and having a blast i ve been practicing guitar some more and learning new techniques i would love to just go about my days at my own pace practicing skills and working on passion projects instead of working a every fuckin day anyone who says they would miss work either has a heart job or lacks passion in other fields
i personally like having my job to regulate things around it really helps regulate my sleep but i also enjoy my job and like the company so those help a lot but that s just me and only applies to me i m glad you were able to recover and make use of your time also i m curious how did you improve your hand writing mine has always been horrible
short term disability is completely different than other long term situations you always knew your time was limited and eventually you d have to go back to work imo people are meant to be productive and if they aren t more serious problems can arise many times when people are in a negative state it can become more positive with productivity but productivity doesn t mean you need a job it can be measured in many different ways some of which you listed even if i won the lottery and was able to quit my job i d probably find some other productive thing to do
i was unemployed for weeks between when i got out the military and got my first post military job i drank myself to sleep every night and was tempted to do bad things because of how bored i was one can only play video games and watch tv for so long
i don t work i haven t for years never been bored ever
anyone who is bored without work is just a pathetic human
lol op is prolly a teenager
and yet we all know you aren t doing those things
honestly i would be bored mainly because i need something to occupy my time it s not bored cause i m not working it s bored because i can t afford to do things besides sit in my house all day without money
excuse me having your gallbladder removed and staying home for a week maybe two as recovery is very short without any complications is not a disability an opposite of your gallbladder experience would be mine i on the other hand ended up in the icu for six days along with blood transfusions a shunt in my pancreas a very painful needle in my neck scar still there yrs later i had a commode directly next to my bed and every single time i went to use the toilet i had to be held up by two icu nurses who had to stand next to me while i went because every time i went i would empty my bowels and fill the entire commode with blood nausea vomiting blood that was my disability gallbladder vaccination any questions
it s impossible to be bored when gives you old and new tv shows movies every month and you can cycle from service to service plus call of duty mobile browsing social media reddit youtube videos and etc this really applies to older people who grew up before the internet took hold they are the ones who don t go to wikipedia biased on political stuff when they hear a topic they don t know about things did get boring just with tv
in the past year of work i ve had trumpublicans make threats to where i ve had to call police and get solicited for sex for a half year til the fucker got fired
eh i would like to work but only because we could use the money didn t have any luck finding jobs i ll be doing passion projects now as i ll be staying home with our firstborn
i haven t worked in months std not the sex one lol and it s been great my pay is cut by but i ll take that stress tax any day i saved up money during that time and now i m about to go to thailand and live in a temple in a month hopefully
just on a personal level i haven t worked in four months because the film industry is mostly down right now and i did those things and am so ready to get back to work i m incredibly bored
i took a year off living on my savings and unemployment during covid one of the best years of my life until i realized i could do minimal online university and live off loans not the best financial moves but the time i ve spent being able to focus on me and enjoy life has been great especially after never taking a holiday in years working since or w e
my dad drives me crazy i think since i was ten every day i can t wait until i retire i hate work complaining about all the stupid stuff at work he retires and after a couple weeks i wish i had a part time job i m so bored
i wont get bored but i will suffer high anxiety because i m way too aware that if i have unlimited free time is because i m a pos who should use this time to do something meaningful instead of smoking weed drink beers and play the same video game over and over
i used to live in mn wild hearing about cub again after all this time i second the notion of having bots flood the site with applications
will they be striking at the quarry in minneapolis
good luck show those arseholes you have power too
unfortunately people have to experience this after being in the work force after things like this their view will change
quiet quitting
quiet quitting is a bs propaganda laden term designed to shame workers
it has for me she has begun giving projects that should be mine or other colleagues to a new employee that is a major kiss up
auto spell check strikes again
i put it in quotes because it s view of corporation when in reality it s people no longer looking to beg and kiss up at work for me it s an exchange of services skills talents for pay i no longer care to give away skills or talents that they won t pay me in return for providing
unfortunately that person will need to have their own experiences as well to see just how far that will really get them
it s true she hasn t given him any promotions but i know he s wanting a particular position and that s why he s steamrolling everyone else so many people have zero respect for the guy and the boss knows it so she s scared to promote him and potentially lose the people that actually do the work
hell i d let the postman use the can at my house if they asked that s just being human
i was an environmental mobile chemist that tested soil air and water around the state i had the same problem i ended up getting one of those camper toilets because i could not use a toilet consistently also the portapotties on the job sites were disgusting and i did not want to be caught with my pants down around some of those men on the job
if we had snacks in at the office i will usually offer some to the couriers at a previous place of work a courier showed up while we were having a staff barbeque and i made him a burger who doesn t let the courier use the bathroom
any vendor or delivery person that comes to our place is entitled to use the bathrooms wtf is wrong with those people
check state laws some states have now passed laws stating that businesses are legally obligated to allow truck drivers to use their bathrooms this applies to the business you re either picking up from or delivering to i manage truck drivers for a living in pa and i m pretty sure pa just passed that law along with a few other states
wtf i let a armenian truck driver use our shitter and grabbed him some water home boy was not used to that southern humidity lol in a secure area i had to wait outside the door and escort him everywhere but it was easier than filling out paperwork about why an elderly truck driver died on the job site
you are delivering product you are an employee i hate people who are like this my mom gets weirded out when people who do repairs on the house ask to use the toilet like they re there for 8h let them wee although i agree it s shitty when they don t flush
stop the delivery close the truck up and say you ll be back in about minutes as you need to take care of a basic human need screw with their time and maybe they will see the error of their ways but i doubt it regardless do what is best for you and your health
imgur https://imgur.com/b30xgsx](https://imgur.com/b30xgsx)) i can use your toilet in the building or i can use my toilet at your front door
she wees are trash as someone who spends a lot of time out where there are no facilities i use a p style it also makes using porta toilets more pleasant much sympathy for your struggles
i would start peeing on the floor inside of whatever store shop you re delivering to that s just me though peeing is kind of my super power honestly though that is very petty of them you don t deserve that
as someone who works at a truckstop that is beyond ridiculous and there is no reason for anyone to deny you a safe place to go to the bathroom
delivery is contingent upon use of your facilities
at my last job i wasn t supposed to let drivers in to use the bathroom they were worried about theft i always let them use the bathroom anyway
tell them to get fucked
just bring a bucket and pee and spill that shit accidentally everywhere
fellow trucker here deny the delivery if they won t allow you to use the restroom can t use the restroom ok you can t have your goods
surprise no one has suggested this yet but as someone with ibs i have a little card in my wallet telling them that is can be a medical emergency works more often than not multiple images online for a card you can use these cards also exist for people with other restroom issues chrons colitis urinary issues some states even have laws forbidding businesses restricting access to anyone with these issues most of them ain t going to bother checking you for a quick pee
people are shitty
it s probably because they had truck driver trash their bathroom or try to take a sink shower now they are taking it out on all truck drivers
i work in receiving not only can you use our bathrooms you can use our break room too grab a soda whatever but i m also treated very well so good employers just trickle down
time for gatorade bottles a funnel and some wet wipes
what the hell our shop let s truck drivers chill in the break room with free reign of coffee and cold water and they get access to the single toilet bathroom i don t even get that
they won t let you use their facilities go around the side of the building and just pee and i m speaking from experience i have had to use the bathroom way too bad and they are being elitist jerks you got to do what you gotta do
take a look at videos for females doing vanlife or living in cars likely find several quality of life improvements
you can thank the dirty fucks that don t care i drove for years the amount of times i saw truckers dumping piss bottles on company property or going in to a restroom only to find it smeared with shit in the friggin terminal made my head explode jesus fuck some lowlife mouth breathers ruin it for everyone the solution i used was a bucket and special bags coupled with the toilet seat attachment for the bucket x200b i feel for ya
where i use to work they allowed everyone to use it and then a few truckers ruined it shat on everything stole paper and clogged the bowl from then on employees only
next time you get denied to use the restroom ask the manager for the phone number for corporate
you re a trucker let s be real there s plenty of asshole drivers who have destroyed fucked up or done some messed up shit sometimes literally inside warehouse employee bathrooms there s often very good reasons they don t want outside contractors using their facilities i once had a driver fling his own shit at my customers employees because he was waiting on site for min to get unloaded
too many nasty truckers have messed it up for the average driver take it from another driver lots of over the road drivers use restrooms and defile them and leave big messes
i m over near college station and i had the same damn problem in houston recently my friend who drove me to the airport there who is an uber driver full time said that s par for the course there as bizarre as it is apparently it has something to do with crime rates and such i had to urinate behind a fucking dumpster
what part of i m delivering stuff to you makes you not on the same level as an employee btw not all female stand to pee accessories are equal rei has a fantastic one that i use when hiking along with antimicrobial towel it takes a little practice try it in the shower first but deffo worth it also check your rights you probably are entitled to use the restroom
just get a large cup and squat pee into it
call osha you have every right to use the bathroom document times your werent allowed and report it
if it were me all their future deliveries would be wet and smell of urine
if they want the delivery you can use the bathroom
pee on their front door if they bring it up later tell them about being denied the bathroom inside
are you talking about the places that you deliver to or just rando truck stops and such
i d feel like saying ok i m going to piss next to your building instead then
i let anyone that supports my place of work use any of the amenities we have soda machine bathrooms shower room whatever they just have to ask support workers get the fucking shaft and since i came up through support i treat my support staff like i wish i would ve been treated
in america that s really strange
i would just go looking for a bathroom if i find one i m using it forget the asking stuff
it should be basic human decency to let people that have to work at your place useyour toilet be it delivery drivers craftsmen mailmen cleaners or who ever the fuck else
i have a flushing camp toilet in my truck i recommend it to every female driver i meet it s been a huge lifesaver
any driver that comes by asking to use the bathroom im like of course even during the pandemic when we would allow nobody into the restaurant id allow bus drivers or truck drivers to come in and use the bathroom kinda evil not to
u vanstrucker2222 do you deliver to shopping centers or do u get access to public facilities cause if not then you could ask to speak with your manager about getting time to use the bathroom
every time i end up on us reddit posts i m always baffled by how fucking crazy you guys are imagine having to piss yourself because you re being denied entry to a random restroom
i m home every night but i have a customer that locks trailers to the dock until they finish loading claim to be done by more often than not they lock the door to their facility and by extension restroom before they finish loading my trailer it has happened many times if it keeps up evacuating myself at their door is going to be the next step if you treat us like animals you shouldn t be surprised when we start behaving like animals
hear me out get used to squatting and just hold a paper cup up to yourself you can totally use one arm to balance on your truck or a tree or whatever if need be have toilet paper or napkins on hand it s total bullshit they won t let you use the restroom but at least you ll have a cup of pee you can dump on their steps
i work at a wineshop liquor store and we always let the delivery folks use our bathroom sorry the people on your route suck
i spent months otr with my husband and i never thought i would do this but eventually i had no choice we would get a fountain drink cup every morning and i would use that i kept tp on the truck for this too then when we would stop i would go to the end of the truck and dump it out and throw the cup away sometimes you gotta pee in the middle of the night and truck stops can be huge and scary and i wasn t waking him up to walk me for a tinkle and sometimes there just isn t anywhere to stop i m sorry they are doing this to you it s amazing to me how disrespectful people are to drivers
i 40f was a truck driver for years i kept a coffee or fountain soda cup in my truck for this weekend if they refused to let me use the bathroom i would just pee in my cup and dump it in their parking lot the men just water a tire so same thing i also made a lot of anonymous tips to their county health departments
i m not you but i d pee in the parking lot by the truck where they can see
i recieve all the trucks at my place and they are all welcome to use the restrooms or my fountian machines
shit on their doorstep
say you re on your period in my experience men will be baffled and embarrassed by that and won t say no woman will be understanding and will let you use the restroom might be embarrassing for you the first time you do it but it s nothing to be ashamed of it s stupid to not let someone use the restroom might as well lie to get what you need just be very blunt and direct i m not a truck driver but i used this lie a couple of times and it has always worked
just pee on the side of their building idk why anyone feels the need to deny a toilet
i used to work in gas station my boss told me to lock the restrooms after certain hours he actually would take the keys and i wouldnt even be able to pee at times i would just go to back and pee by the garbage since it is dark enough not to see some guy asked to use the restroom and i told him what it is he went outside and peed to the window
i stay in houston what company you work i needs get put on
i know it sucks but there are some alternatives i used to work as a cable guy and frequently needed the bathroom with nothing available i kept a gallon bucket and some plastic bags in the back of my van for emergencies you could also get those camping toilets that really don t take up much space
that s awful i would let you use an employee washroom it s a bodily function to say no to anyone is just rude i ve let delivery people use my washroom if it s summer grab a cold drink too it really costs nothing to be decent to each other
this is some bullshit our drivers were our lifeblood we had regular ups fedex and cargo drivers we knew their names we talked about our families if we were having a dreaded pizza party they were offered food and drink they were definitely allowed to use the can op ask for a new route so you re not delivering to absolute shitheels
what s your houston route tc jester and i shell has a dedicated women s bathroom
my work had an outhouse for truckers only no employees allowed we also let truckers use our washrooms if they asked and they always left it cleaner than they found it
idk why but this reminds me of an episode of cops i was watching with my retired police sergeant dad cops had arrested a dude for possession and was talking to his supervisor the arrestee is standing behind the cop doing the i gotta pee dance and asking to pee the cops told him you can t do that here my dad burst out jesus let the guy pee there s cops on scene he isn t going anywhere and if he pees in the back of your car you gotta clean it up
get one of those big red folgers coffee containers and put cat litter in a grocery bag inside then put a roll of toilet paper on top when you gotta go take out the tp open the bag with the litter inside the can and just squat over the container when you re done just pull out the bag with the soiled litter and toss it in a trash can definitely do not throw your waste outside the office where they won t let you use the bathroom that would be wrong
why not have a bucket in your truck that you sit on and that you dump on the side of the road
i let every
no this is for employees only then i guess i won t be delivering your order then
tell them you re pregnant that ll usually loosen them up
i couldn t imagine saying no to a delivery driver asking to use the bathroom i just give them fair warning it s pretty rough
get one of those automotive funnels the long ones meant for oil they re around and have a large funnel the long tube part that normally goes into the oil fill fits into the thermoses really well you can hear the liquid filling the bottle and you ll know if it s close to the top i use thermoses because i don t have room to hide a pee bottle and the thermoses just look like a normal thing to have as does the automotive funnel when i empty them in the morning it just looks like i m emptying old coffee or tea then i put isopropyl alcohol in them i suppose in your truck you could just have a regular pee bottle but idk i ve lived in my car and peeing is no issue for me
while i was in college i did some part time work as a security guard out front of a pasta factory i had the midnight to 8am shift and was responsible for weighing trucks as they entered and exited the facility i had a tiny little guard shack with enough room for two people to sit in and not much else it did have a small little room with a toilet i let a trucker use the toilet once and they proceeded to decimate the thing the smell was unbelievable and the guy just let er rip like i wasn t feet away from him in the next room i had to sit and stew in this guy s stink for the remainder of my shift never again
holy shit i would let anyone pee that needed it what the fuck o o apparently that will be a policy at my brewery everybody pees
i was eating in a restaurant and a delivery driver came in to pick up asked to use the washroom they said no customers only so he told them he wasn t delivering their food order and left i walked down the back alley afterwards and it looked like someone pissed on the restaurants backdoor
i worked in a corporate office and someone reported to upper management that the mail carriers where using the restrooms i went ballistic and made a big deal within the entire office about how obsurd and self righteous it was to report something like that they are delivering our mail for a whopping fuckin cents per letter the least we can do is let them use the bathroom
just use it if they say that what are they gonna do to you
it s not ideal but there s the amazon bottle method
we need more public bathrooms
most people are too elite to permit servants to use a resntroom that s just how our culture functions
i let someone once and they shit all over the place never again
i d probably think twice but only due to the shame of letting another person see the state of my bathroom
my friend who is a truck driver long haul did this but eventually just switched to adult diapers
lots of places a lot of restaurants won t even let 3rd party delivery drivers use them it s ridiculous there s this perception that if you let someone you don t know use your shitter they re gonna destroy it
seriously if you want good service from courier s you give them some benefits in return
one place i worked at delibrately had the werehouse toilets near the loading dock for that very reason
i ran into the same issue going into houston early early in the morning like 3am to catch a plane per the friend who drove me who s a full time uber driver that s typical in houston i legit had to relieve myself behind a dumpster yet another reason to fucking hate houston
it is the first thing i tell people working at my home i show them the hall restroom and tell them they may use it without asking and to help themself to the sodas and water in the fridge basic human dignity is afforded to all
incorrect truckers are contractors unless handling in house freight
add some kitty litter to the liner and you have my setup for a camp toilet better than nothing tbh works pretty well
osha would have nothing to do with this it is a business telling someone that isn t a worker of their business they cannot use their bathroom as bad as that is the business has the right to do so while the truck driver is allowed to be there the business can dictate where the person can and cannot go as they are not an employee of the company that also includes bathrooms me personally every time a truck driver has wanted to use the bathroom and asked i told them to go ahead as holding it in can cause far more problems however if that driver destroyed anything in the process that specific driver would be banned from using it again as that is a different issue altogether
sorry osha requires a company to allow employees of other companies to use their bathrooms that s a bizarre take
almost assuredly the receivers truck stops make their money from truckers and would not dare deny them use of facilities although an ever increasing problem is truck stops taking money for reserved spots and not kicking the non paying douchecanoes out
or the tipping bs over there i feel like half of those issues would be non existent if people just were more assertive
as a lone female at home i m not letting anybody i don t know personally through my front door that s not elitest that s not wanting to be robbed strangled or god knows what else
our culture is a giand dumpster fire
i had a roof worker at my apartment ask to use my restroom i said no i m not an elitist i just don t let complete strangers into my apartment when i m home alone
after nearly years bartending i can say with absolute confidence that if anyone is going to destroy the toilet it s either a customer or the owner the delivery people were perhaps the most chill folks i ever had to deal with no nonsense no guff in and out quick as you like
i was a delivery driver and one time i had no choice but absolutely destroy one restaurant s bathroom i felt pretty bad cuz i knew the smell was gonna spread but i had no choice it was the highest level code brown emergency and my other option was to shit my pants
you were in houston looking for a urinal the whole city is a urinal
i feel you my last job i was working hours a week and was always exhausted broke and couldn t afford anything outside of bills now i m jobless and broke and can t afford anything outside of bills at least i m not exhausted but having a job and not having a job is pretty much the same
the billionaire that owns your company wants to thank you insert employee rest assured your voices are heard we will be having a mandatory company pizza party insert slow day here the nominal fee will be discounted to this year
i feel you i make what is supposed to be enough to live on but only have a few hundred left over after bills and food a lot of that few hundred goes towards gas since i have to commute minutes to work
you are generating surplus value for your employer that s number priority your ability to exist is is not in that calculus hence these results
pro tip work less hard get a job where you are sitting on your ass at a desk all day so you do not exert nearly as much physical energy you metabolism will drop thus making you less hungry less often i did this and was able to cut down to meals a day i am getting ready to go down to meal a day so i can save some money also if your stomach growls just ignore it as it will eventually go away
sh t dude can t you find help with your family or friends i would stay with them and help with home expenses if i wasn t able to afford food ps no job has a point unless it s volunteering we are probably working for shareholders or some rich a hole who doesn t care about us
this sounds like multi step problem to sort out on an immediate level you literally have no food option for a meal for tonight
eat the _ _ _ _ _ _
squidward gets it
there was a woman in our office that used to show up to meetings with a shirt that said sorry i m late but i don t want to be here she was the best
i got one for my brother a few christmases ago it was pretty big just like squidwards lol
google man they make everything https://www.amazon.com/instabuttons-really-werent-pinback-button/dp/b01fboc36s) now not official spongebob merchandise
what s wrong with the ad i can find plenty of job posting looking for non white candidates
year old company pride culture is bullshit too
true
don t be that co worker that has a question when the boss asks does anyone have any questions at the end of the meeting
this could have been an email
the meetings must continue until morale improves
so many meetings could be an email or preempted by an email so that we just meet to cover any questions as a senior project manager i haven t run a meeting that lasted more than minutes in my last two roles
i once was on a team that had monthly status reports ok not that unreasonable but these status reports would be the entire team of people sitting in a room and each team would present in order the boss would constantly interrupt with tactical questions that were esoteric enough to be completely meaningless to everyone not directly involved in the work the meeting would go for hours break for catered lunch and then the boss would give his remarks for another hour or more i calculated once how much that meeting cost it was easily million each time we did it at least we got lunch and most people used the time to get work done instead of listen
if you have hair that can cover your ears get cordless headphones and listen an audiobook or podcast
also don t be that boss that insists on asking every single person by name if they have anything to add ok folks round table steve any questions no ok steph how about you no come on people don t be afraid to speak jill any closing remarks
yeah i just had a question about the month roadmap can you talk a little about how we re prioritizing projects
i literally have multiple hour long meetings every week that are just meant to get everyone on the same page or otherwise share information no thanks
i ve literally been in meetings to discuss what meetings we should have
in my decades of work i ve only worked one place that did really good standup huddle type meetings they were often minutes long you were expected to be punctual or you might miss the entire meeting and then each person would say one or two sentences about their work you were only supposed to share things that were relevant to the group if anyone had questions or wanted to discuss further they d sync up after the meeting it was beautiful
that s like the human centipede but with meetings
i m don t have kids and have zero regrets about it
why would anyone want kids nowadays most people can barely afford a roof over their head
i have kids and have regrets i m constantly worried about the state of the world that they will be inheriting
i d never be able to offer kids the kind of opportunities i got from growing up in a tradesman s single income home even though we were a family of
wish not wanting kids could be normalize some day
no kids never wanted still don t how can you raise a child in this economic environment knowing that they will be worse off than you because that s how it works
why would i bring kids into a country descending into fascism which i myself can barely afford to live in
well when the average cost for raising one child in america from birth to is then yeah no shit more people are opting out of having children
no need for crotch goblins to leech your fun and finances in this sad world we re in
i want children but i wont worry about that till im ish
is is unlikely for us to live to live up to years anyway even if we could our kids will not be able to care about us as they will struggle themselves
can confirm
i have one child and i do not want another my wife wants another but we are in no position to have another
don t want kids never have my brother once told me that i d change my mind if i had some and if i don t change my mind are you going to take them and pay me back for everything i spent
we are all actually quite happy that you don t have kids
this plus i went to school it was horrible i won t do that to a kid
well tomorow is gonna be filled with someone i would prefer someone who share my origine and my culture to take my place rather than someone that would not
i dunno a lot of our parents did it
ngl that sounds like a very good insult
controversial take but i d rather corporations automate vs hiring people to do tasks and then exploiting them no business model should be allowed to be profitable only on the basis of exploitation
honestly my biggest gripe with the self checkouts is there are no fucking bags to put your items in like holy fuck is it that hard to supply cent bags
and drag every industry down while you re at it recently saw a job post to become a walmart therapist for like below market rate with a masters degree minimum
they are eliminating the poor but paying the people higher up more money
how slums are created
yea then they kick out half the applicants due to bs lie detector test results
is this posted on indeed please say yes
do not get me started regarding tsa i have a relative who applied for a position with them had to take a test she failed was told she had to wait months to take it again months later she signs up to take the test has to reschedule and did so before the hour deadline to do so site did not process the request somehow even though she has a printed copy of it so she is done forever applying there it is impossible to speak to someone so as desperate as they are they just fucked her over big time
i think indeed just posts all federal jobs from usa jobs
hey bill we re overthrowing libya on saturday please be here at 8am sorry jim i put in pto for this weekend to take my daughters guinea pig to the vet oh right hope all goes well see you monday then
lol denied as soon as they find your commie antiwork account
i ll only help them if they let me investigate ufos
please tell me you re not planning on becoming part of the state apparatus of political repression https://harvardpolitics.com/fred-hampton-assassination/
there s no way they actually use a lie detector on applicants that s some pseudo science bullshit that the courts don t even accept
yes it is
i m just frustrated reading this all of the companies cooperation and even the government need people but make them jump through hoops or won t even give them the time of day
i wouldn t pass the drug test anyway
nope this just popped up while i was scrolling through bartending and automotive jobs i thought it was funny
all fbi employees are polygraphed on two issues the first issue is on drug usage the second issue is on counterintelligence national security polygraph those are the two issues that all fbi employees have to pass a polygraph on source https://www.fbi.gov/audio-repository/news-podcasts-inside-background-checks-for-new-applicants.mp3/view#:~:text=all%20fbi%20employees%20are%20polygraphed,to%20pass%20a%20polygraph%20on.%e2%80%9d
the fbi and other alphabet federal agencies do things that are generally not allowed by private companies my understanding is that depending on your security clearance you can expect to get polygraphed regularly
i don t know why the fbi recruiting on indeed is funny to me they re like we have zero name recognition we need to get this out there lol
even worse you can send them a dm on twitter and all it does is ask what language you want to communicate in you pick one and send the message then the reply once again asks what language you want to communicate in a never ending vicious cycle of imcompetence
that s fucking bananas
if you re a foreign agent tryna infiltrate the fbi wouldn t you be trained to pass a polygraph i mean the tv shows i ve seen say so so it must be true
i m convinced it s some sort of phishing scam i can t believe the fbi would legitimately post shit on indeed
all federal jobs are posted on usajobs com https://usajobs.com). they routinely crosspost those vacancies on monster indeed linkedin to get broader reach
that s insane in my 20s i lied while on a lie detector for a job it s not hard
cars always explode
the fbi application process is specific and wouldn t be carried out through indeed but they absolutely post job listings on career sites to spark interest and direct people to their website they also recruit for instance they had a table at a hacker convention i went to a few years back they have a tough time finding what they need especially things like computer and science engineering backgrounds due to the very strict personal conduct policies i knew a guy who got bounced from the process because he occasionally took a migraine medication that was prescribed to his mother instead of him you also have to be under and the physical is no joke
indeed
yeah it s not indeed easy apply have to go to their website
i m still waiting for the ups union to snake up
i explained unions to a young coworker and she said why isn t everyone doing this and i had to them explain union busting and it was like i had told her santa isn t real which is how i also felt when i learned about union busting
a little unsure of the snake metaphor when the workers are mice or also rats
maybe my brain s broken but the way the comic reads it looks like it s saying that the union is worse than the bully corporations
i m in a union but because the good people of ontario gave the conservatives a majority government if you strike the government just legislates you back to work which makes the union pointless because management knows we have no leverage oh and the government has capped whole industries at pay raises per year inflation and a raise whoopie
rats are actually quite cool in experiments where they had doors to unlock behind one a stranger of the same species door a treat they were the only animals that freed the stranger first and then brought the treat to share they were the only animals that did that also they have fun driving tiny cars and play doom bosses are pigs not rats
wobblies represent
source for the artwork
wouldn t the snake eat both the rat and the mice aren t snakes usually used to represent someone who is untrustworthy
the k m
this is a great set of panels except it needed at least two more ending with boss rat being swallowed head first by the union snake
oh this one goes hord
union
apes together strong
we also need to make unions some kind of political force unions need to be collectively putting up pro union political candidates

i remember my first interaction with a union i was working at a casino in las vegas as security there was a culinary union who decided that our casino organization should have their cooks unionized there was a vote and they lost they then showed up and started throwing eggs slashing tires and there were even several arrests when they attacked a manager and put her in the hospital thats how you know unions are the moral right because if you vote them down they resort to violence very upstanding
my experience with unions is absolute trash though i ve honestly had way better luck in my non union company yearly union dues plus percent of my wages union dues then servicing fees that came out to like percent of my fringe pay awful healthcare unions are all shams run by crooks these days
unions aren t always the answer we unionized at my last job and they cut my commission of which i was making close to month on top of my hourly wage the day the contract was final i lost my commission and free show tickets and got a dollar raise not all unions are bad but be mindful of what you sign up for
i know construction unions are ass backwards compared to others i know an owner of a non union company in the midwest he is consistently fighting against the union they picket his jobs they slander his name by saying he pays his guys in drugs and traffics women and none of it s true i ve know him my whole life and he s an honest hardworking man who built the company himself yet if you are not part of the union all they want to do is tear you down until you don t have a company anymore he s one of the larger subcontractors in drywall in his state and the union can t stand it because they want all of the jobs while he has more than enough jobs to keep his guys busy the entire year many unions around here have guys sitting on the bench in slow months so they go and try to tear down companies like his in the years he s been doing it he s seen multiple big subcontractors fall because of the union not to mention any guy who used to work for the union and goes non union has nothing good to say about them they talk up the pay but you end up paying half in union fees and dues and if you don t finish your time you don t get your pension they don t treat their guys well and it s a big scam in the construction industry
source
usps union took a25 pay cut unions are useful
makes me think of mouseland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkoklxczbu0), a speech by tommy douglas its more about social democracy than unions but the two are linked in solidarity
part of a state union and honestly i m questioning quitting at least every week if not every day there are a million issues that have been ongoing and stacking upon each other for years and i ve only been here months i ll be out of here as soon as i can find a job that pays better but there s just nothing around here without heavy qualifications i want to be a part of a union that cares about its workers but my own coworkers are narcs from a different generation and don t care about my situation they care deeply for the company the one thing i can say in favor of this union is that the benefits are unmatched and while i am barely making enough for the insane rent i pay i d have a lot more expenses in a non union job
an injury to one is an injury to all
right as the usps is dissolved like there can only ever be one unionized logistics agency in the united states at a time
its not the same thing though if everyone joined a union union busting wouldnt be a thing where i live being part of a union is considered essential to work i used to be in an american company we had one of those meetings all managers invited full day thing about unions naturally everyone went and 3minutes in when it was clear it was bullshitting about unions everyone walked out saying bullshit
it speaks volumes that public education in north america white washes or completely ignores the violent and inhumane history of union busting corporate corruption and the criminals who attempt to subvert democratic processes through lobbying and mercenary violence never forget the battle of blair mountain doom to the pinkertons and all their vile spawn solidarity forever
wait santa isn t real

yeah it s not a very good metaphor but good art
snake owner who has had to deal with both mice and rats and pest i have oddly relevant experience mice and rats are both territorial rats can and will push mice out of their territories owners exploiting workers snakes especially venomous ones like rattlesnakes are one of the few creatures that will take on an adult rat regularly almost everything else is a more general hunter hawks other birds of prey are unwilling to risk a fight with a rat since they re vicious little asshats that carry diseases and will gonafter easier prey cats especially and foxes too i believe or they re too big for rats to be worth hunting wolves mountain lions a bit of creative license but the mice form or get a snake the one creature who can and will take on the rat and kill it or in the union version force to company to capitulate
i believe it s saying the rats the boss have power over mice the workers but togeather as a union the workers are a snake which would eat a raw makes sense in food chain terms somewhat
as individuals we are mice but together we are a snake the snake is at the top of the food chain the snake wouldn t also eat the mice because the snake is the mice think of it like a mech suit if it helps i guess lol
yea agree would have made more sense if a union was a rat mouse king
the best and simplest explanation of how unions work was on law and order s18 ep16 anthony anderson explains how they work using a muffin and can of soda as props
only if you bite the snake
imagine how they d have to explain to their corporate bribers if y all just said fuck this shit and walked out anyway
how will government force everyone back to work again
wild rats are territorial aggressive and carry diseases they push mice out of their territory and few creatures are willing to hunt them and venomous snakes are about the only dedicated hunters cats are frightened by them and birds of prey are more general
we need better animal metaphors bosses aren t rats or pigs they are skunks skunks are mediocre hunters who aren t really good at hunting anything bigger than them stink are unpleasant to be around and generally act tough but actually aren t
we re doin it in texas
jonas goonface on ig
as a snake owner i find this is to be poor representation of snakes snakes are stealthy yes but they only strike to defend themselves or to hunt unlike many other creatures cough cats cough snakes don t kill for no reason generally only to feed or defensively they eat rarely and consume it entirely rather than only pieces and leaving a carcass venomous snakes are also one of the few creatures in the us especially that is able to willing to and finds it worthwhile to hunt adult rats regularly most other predators either can t are unwilling to risk rats are very vicious and of course carry diseases cats and such will generally avoid adult rats and go after easier prey or are too large to find the worthwhile
except for the one you don t want to step on
unions aren t random groups they have a representative from your own work place that will help negotiate then everybody at your workplace need to vote with the new negotiation and if the majority agrees then the new contract takes place so probably your teamworkers were ok with a raise and there is a chance they didn t had any commission before to fight for
certificate the exception along with police to the rule
what s the name of the company
oh i forgot the other reason i haven t quit our union puts the responsibility of finding a cover for our shifts on my boss not on me or my coworkers so i can call out with basically zero notice and that s all i have to do seems pretty basic to me but i know that s not super common
problem is with a national union there s less people for corporate to bribe
i m curious what could other reasons be
voltron with mice that turn into a snake now that we ve spelt it out in terms that i can understand vive la revo union
i bite snakes every day
wildcat strikes are always good
they have ludicrously serious fines attached to continuing to strike i think it was like 10k a day for each person and 100k a day for the union
by fining you in to oblivion
sounds also more like how rich talk about working class people aggressive carry disease dirty than how anyone would describe a capitalist
pouring like an avalanche that was coming down the mountain
a wobbly union
yeah the vote was for yes and for no at the time of the vote they hadn t introduced this as something they were planning to negotiate the came hard with pushing for more pto and sick time but never mentioned taking commission away before the vote a few months after it was final they introduced this contract that them and the company agreed to edit i failed to mention that everybody was entitled to the commissions some just didn t put in any extra effort for it
i would worry that a big union would be just as corrupt as a big corporation
there was a fair amount of labor corruption in big unions several decades ago that eroded the trust of unions among rank and file labor that and the rigidity of some contracts and union structures left a political opening for government to come in and make an argument for curtailing the power of organized labor which in turn left it even more exposed to the subterfuge of union busting of course there s nothing inherently wrong with organized labor but it stands that the quality of the organization reflects the quality of the leadership and the intelligent involvement of its membership just like any democracy the initial organizing is only the beginning of the work not the end of it and for many types of work that have traditionally been fairly transient such as retail and service work it s not worth the time and effort in many workers minds to go through all of that trouble if there s the idea that another better job will likely come along in a few months or years
removed
do they taste like chicken
that is how the uaw got it s start
didn t they just strike anyway and say fuck the fines
then quitting entirely and finding something else to do telling me i can t strike means i say fuck you and your entire business sector
play dirty aggressive and exploitative and carry the disease of ambition
thanks for catching that
iww or industrial workers of the world
one big union http://www.iww.org)
depends how it s structured but yeah
unions are only as effective as the size of their membership bigger is necessarily better unions that represent workers across different industries or crafts and which aren t racist inherently wield more leverage
any powerful position will eventually attract people looking to exploit that power if a watch isn t kept for these people and rules aren t built to make exploiting a position a how fast can i get fired sued arrested speedrun it will swiftly become rotten and the rot will start spreading outwards the reason that anti corruption agencies and etc exist are that neither the public the media etc can be relied on to maintain the required vigilance forever there is a recurring trend that shows when union corruption scandal story breaks the public their membership holds unions to a standard significantly higher than the behaviour they allow from politicians and corporations once the corruption breaks trust it s typically quite easy for capitalists to sway a bunch of public sentiment through their mouthpieces making sure the public is told the most anti union version of the story they will also start making arguments that basically boil down to at least we are honest about our bastardry so why not accept this bribe and deal with the devil you know
propaganda worked well on you
propaganda my dude not a valid reason against a union thats just propaganda my dude they incentivize knowing your worth and not killing yourself for a company easily proven to be untrue by the simple fact that on average union workers have wages higher than their non union counterparts
actually yes
i think some teachers did for a bit
igm a german union for metal workers is currently pushing for a day work week they might just succeed which would actually be pretty amazing
there are also company unions that are fake they basically just call the hr department a union
what propaganda the government loves unions everywhere i look i see people cheering unions on do you have anti union propaganda where you live
that s just propaganda please explain this claim what form does anti union propaganda take what does it posit and how does it apply to what i said i don t know if i ve ever seen anti union propaganda in my life but maybe that s because i can t recognize it
what
quick reminder that during the great depression ceo compensation was like to we are in worse inequality times than we were in during the great depression if you re wondering at all why everything is fucked this is why this is the entire reason why
pay a living wage there s no reason to cause so many people to live in poverty so you can own yaughts mansions and luxurious vacations
anti union consultant cause fuck them workers
so they spent years worth of average employee work years to fight this that s how much they hate workers
amazon should have a union the work conditions in their warehouses are atrocious at best
time to bring back eisenhower s top marginal tax rate
i feel like we re having the wrong argument if amazon can t exist without inflicting harm on employees we don t deserve to have amazon i don t believe that amazon couldn t exist with union employees but if it truly can t then it shouldn t exist at all
who tf grows up and thinks i want to be an anti union consultant how fucked up must your head be
and then the politician who was largely funded by big business via super pacs then turns to you and says but this is how we motivate and incentivize innovation i dont give a damn about innovation if most regular people are wage slaves and have a a declining standard of living and life expectancy why innovate if its the that benefits and nothing changes for the
amazon is too big not to have unions at this point there s too much risk the drivers have to go through on the daily basis and alot of boxes all employees have to handle which is hard on your joint health if not given proper breaks in between
so given that amazon has about 5m employees if each employee was given a raise that would equate to about 15b extra annually spending 2m on union busting is still significantly cheaper its still not right but this is the corporate business math that they all do
and the consultants were a tax write off
i cannot for the life of me figure out how anyone working for amazon would vote against unionizing it s absolutely baffling
in the times of christ people only worked to hrs a day they rested in the heat if the day and enjoyed the earth for a govt to allow this greed and say they are christ minded when people starve and steal to eat us a travesty against human kind it s beyond greed it s hatred
i wouldn t work at an amazon warehouse if they paid me ten times what they re offering
it s always tricky that they use compensation instead of pay because that s usually stock options and those are kinda fake money the second they try to realize the value it tanks bezos salary was notoriously a dollar yes amazon stocks skyrocketed during covid it s also true their profit margin is basically break even labor organizing and raising the cost of labor by some substantial multiplayer for jobs that in any other sector would get paid half of what they already are paid at amazon is most assuredly an existential threat
why do i feel million is a lowball number
if you capitalism hard enough you end up with feudalism
if you make 6400x more the your workers you are beyond greedy it s fucking insane thinking your 6400x more valuable then your workers generating your revenue imagine all the tax that didn t get paid the economy is eating itself like a snake while these greedy fucks build shelters to survive the purge zzzz
so 2m divided by 6m amazon workers like per person if you took the 2m 212m ceos salary and divided it by the 6m amazon workers it comes to per employee i m not saying the ceos salary is justified i m saying isn t shit for these workers we need regulations in place to control price gauging and corporate greed
amazon is actively firing most of their work force how about instead of these shills actively shipping propaganda to keep poors working in ish conditions we stop companies from becoming powerful enough to get you pissing in bottles they are pushing you to fight for a union how about the government get off its posterior and get to work breaking up faang companies oh that s right because actually getting things done would mean that dont spend all day on twitter riling people up to keep them in office
even better is that company like all companies will spent million of that profit on lobbying the single aisle of politician that exists in america to ensure they stay afloat
it s clear that andy jassy failed to run amazon properly if he had done a good job he would not be laying off their incredibly talented work force but would be overseeing innovation that matched or even exceeded what had been achieved in the past someone needs to put him on a performance improvement plan i m the meantime he should get no more than 2x the median amazon income and no bonuses whatsoever
put that million towards your employees and improve there situation and watch them work harder for you and provide more quality
amazon had employees if you took every penny that guy made for the year and distributed it among the employees everyone would get an extra for the year if your focus isn t on how badly the government is fucking your currency you re just doing their work for them for free
so how much would each worker get extra if amazon spend this extra million on their workers according to statista they had about million employees worldwide in so that would average to a pay raise of per year or a month before taxes of course wouldn t really change much for anybody
don t worry saving capitalism author robert reich has great ideas to remedy this issue i m sure
of course they can t because is a matter of power
million is only the tip of the iceberg
it s not that amazon execs can t afford a union it s the ostracizing from their neoliberal peers would be too much to bear
this is why i avoid shopping on amazon go to the retail or vendor site and order the item from there instead amazon s goal is to kill other retail whole foods used to be an awesome grocery store even though it was a bit expensive after amazon bought whole foods i ve been boycotting them too
i read that the former ceo of bed bath and beyond was being stiffed out of his severance and that payments he was getting have stopped headline bath beyond s ousted ceo says he s not to blame for the company s failed turnaround and demands his million severance my gums bleed for this poor guy see https://www.businessinsider.com/ousted-bed-bath-beyond-ceo-defends-legacy-suing-over-severance-2023-4
5m employees average 32k giving the 212m evenly increase salaries by each
how many employees does amazon have in the us would 14m have been better invested in employee compensation rather than union busting if they had instead divided the 14m between all non executive employees would it have made a significant difference in pay performance
tbf that is less than bucks per employee per year
at interest million would get you per year how can you spend million without just accumulating asset let alone mil per year may be we need a tax on wealth over a reasonable limit i ve had some pretty good jobs in the last years and still in my working life years i ve probably earned a total less than to date but here s the rub how do you agree on what that limit is how do you legislate that limit without people living on the poverty line voting you out because the believe it will some how effect them
he s worth it once you become such a great ceo you can be more modest and take just million until then
i m not in any way excusing amazon s behavior and i agree this whole system is fucked here s a big reason it is fucked management of a corporation has a fiduciary obligation to do everything legally permissible to maximize shareholder returns shareholders through the board of directors of the corporation can instruct management to do other things e g treat workers well pay them more let them join unions etc in privately held corporations this is routinely done in publicly traded corporations this is almost never done because pension funds hedge funds individual investors etc only want increased quarterly returns on their publicly traded stocks the really fucked part is that once a corporation is owned by a threshold of shareholders it has to comply with public reporting requirements which make it essentially a requirement that the company conduct an ipo by us regulation the whole system is fucked and what is good for companies and workers long term becomes irrelevant
and then you remember that there are million amazon employees so that price discrepancy would result in everyone only get dollars more over a year it sucks but it also isn t really that relevant
the worst part is worker wouldn t even need unions if you just treated them right
that s false that comp package was over years not a single year that s not to say amazon can t afford to pay workers more just let s get facts straight here
just fyi you can look up executive compensation on form def 14a here is amazon s https://www.sec.gov/archives/edgar/data/1018724/000110465922045572/tm223357-5_def14a.htm) scroll to page name and principal position year salary stock awards all other compensation total andrew r jassy president and chief executive officer represents a special grant in connection with mr jassy s promotion to president and ceo this award vests over years with more than of the shares scheduled to vest between and years after grant and is expected to represent most of mr jassy s compensation for the coming years of his compensation is restricted stock that has a decade long vesting period
look i m not advocating that people shouldn t get paid better but i hate this argument so much because it s so stupid just on a math level like basic math just utterly obliterates this argument amazon has employees if we re to distribute that to every employee that means they all get a whopping the math doesn t work out to anything substantial if we distribute all of bezos wealth which remember is tied up in stocks and not liquid it s an additional per person still not great rather what you should focus on is where total company revenues go i m sure there are things amazon can cut out to increase employee wages one of those being executive wages of course but at the end of the day it s a more fundamental shift than just omg ceo makes big money also amazon workers make pretty good money at least around where i live they are pushing hr or so based on what i see on indeed so quit with this bs argument and find better ones because there are better and more valid ways to argue i m utterly convinced that of you don t understand how money works in companies which is why you stick to this low hanging fruit when there s much better ways
based on million employees if they gave an hour raise to everyone that would be over billion
what the heck even is an anti union consultant i m not american i do know what a union is but that sounds like a ridiculous job lmao ceo union bad consultant yes yes union bad profit
this may sound a bit insensitive but do you think it s acceptable to compare the compensation of an employee who stocks shelves or loads boxes to that of a c level executive you re just deflecting the argument that you should be having about folks who need it when you should be comparing cost of living with wages of those who are not c level i think you need to compartmentalize the problem to have a meaningful discussion
it s so weird they re probably spending more money than if they just paid people it s cruelty just to be cruel
all the money in the world won t stop fire from burning the rich alive
actuary tables consulted by their legal team probably show that million on anti union consultants is cheaper in the long run because they save more than that by paying shit wages here s the hack around that instead of working at amazon become an anti union consultant then act like a double agent and recommend unions
don t get me wrong amazon is awful but amazon has around 6m employees their consultants cost them less than person
absolutely disgusting that s all i can say
robert reich lecturing about the importance of labor unions is pretty rich considering that as bill clinton s labor secretary he helped the president sell nafta to a reluctant unwilling congress and as a reminder the passage of nafta helped lead to a fatal weakening of american labor unions physician heal thyself
nearly all of that is in stock options that vest over years he was not handed million dollars for whatever that s worth
amazon has over 800k employees let s say amazon has employees that would be covered under the union pretty conservative estimate million divided by employees is do you believe a union will only extract from the company to a worker or do you think amazon fighting against unions for million has nothing to do with what it can afford for employees
also do not forget how many people came to amazon from fedex amazon s mgmt mindset is probably influenced greatly by their decisions and experience there fedex is famous for union busting
i really don t understand the argument against ceo s making money the alternative is being able to dictate what that company is allowed to pay their ceo s which isn t fair to them if a company thinks a ceo is worth a stupid large amount of money why is it our right to stop them what gives us that right
is that compensation or stock appreciation
the ceo of amazon andy jassy livable salary is 175k base 600k in other reported income so 775k which is less than card b or a run of the mill mlb outfielder his theoretical compensation was million but since the stock price has fallen from to share he has lost in the last months million but it was theoretical anyways it s not like that money exists it s sitting in shares that maybe in a few years he can sell considering the economic conditions here that isn t as certain a number as the tweeter seems to think it is now amazon has million employees so he runs a pretty large organization each of those employees averages 33k year in base salary but they also get 401k match which is and most employees who work over hours year also get rsus i e a stock package so it s really disingenuous to make the comparison above what bothers me the most about this is that it appears no one in the us is financially literate anymore and that no one in the us understands what game is being played amazon is really two distinct ideas there is the entity that sells you shit and the entity that exists to sell shares the entity that exist to sell shares can go to zero ask silicon valley bank in case you don t put two and two together here those executives and all workers who had stock based compensation and perks were just wiped out totally the cost of union busting equates to worker per year that s it it isn t like amazon is trying real hard here that s it amazon is just going to automate as many workers as it can if you unionize you just will speed up that process unionizing is actually going to speed up being unemployed in fact the pro union movement isn t very honest here either because they know that unionizing will speed up automation union leadership make a shitload of money and always have as each industry dies they make a lot of money off of the death of it
so go invent an amazon rival and pay your employees hour it s pretty simple
this is a disgrace
mainly don t tell me because i don t actually care if they can afford a union we can t afford no union
hey look an angry balloon with such allies why would workers fear enemies
who is the typical worker in amazon if you work in amazon warehouse a general warehouse associate earns around 37k if you work in the software division the base salary starts at 160k stock options a senior sde in software earns 242k in cash and 242k in stocks amazon delivery driver earns upto per hour
there is no way the average amazon employee makes amazon engineers get paid a ton this tweet is lying when they could just be honest the ceo still makes a ton compared to the rest of the employees
amazon has about million employees and at 32k each were paid a total of nearly billion million is about per employee
i think that anyone who comes in a thread like this to make comments about how evil or greedy someone else is solely on the basis of their salary is just so unbelievably jealous i cannot think of another reason that someone could feel justified and confident to publicly state that someone else shouldn t have something
don t tell me that amazon can t afford to allow workers to join a union the total amount of money mentioned in the post adds up to less than a pay increase for workers can we try a little harder to come up with good ideas
if the amazon workforce unionizes it s going to cost the company far more than million in the form of out sized union pay and benefits possibly pensions overtime pay reduced productivity difficulty in firing problem employees etc as a shareholder i want them running lean and profitable not bloated every extra dollar in the pocket of a union goon is a dollar out of a shareholder s pocket
while true they are not the epitome of evil people make them out to be our friend is a warehouse worker and gets weeks of maternity leave meanwhile my wife is a nurse and gets a big fat zero don t mean to detract from the post cause amazon is shitty but some warehouses are better than others
typical worker yeah no cut out all the low tier hourly wage slaves who should have been contracted out to third party staffing agencies and you are left with a much higher number probably around 125k those are the ones who add value to the companies those are the real employees the rest are just holding amazon over until robots can replace them
yeah but people won t stop using amazon even though they sit here and bitch about the disparities because fuck everyone else i got mine
just thought i would point out that amazon had total employees in if you paid the ceo nothing and returned those funds to employees evenly they would only make an additional per year or about hr unfortunately when it comes to big big business people have no fucking concept of how little million dollars really is or how quickly you blow through it compensating all employees or highly comp d ones the real meat is what was the companies total profits from revenue not what some hce got paid for their work
lmfao anyone who works for bezos
i wonder how much employees amazon has world wide that could get a raise with those 14m spent against them somehow
million is a bit low for how unionization would cost them they have million employees so that s only per employee unionization would probably cost at least per employee in higher wages and better benefits that puts it around billion a year
corps just do everything they can to maximize profits within the framework of the law and it s their job to do that it s the politicians jobs to adjust the framework in favor of workers so they re the ones failing miserably of the blame is on politicians for letting corps get away with murder
while i agree amazon should and could pay more this is generally a crap argument amazon has around million employees even if the ceo and consultants got paid you take that million dollars and split it over the maybe million people that need it most it s a one time payment of
haha gopro ceo woodman made more than that in
unfathomable where the hell have you been also million is a drop in the bucket for amazon potentially doubling their labor costs make their makes their entire economic model unsustainable so it makes sense that they would spend a paltry amount to keep their costs in line
wouldn t it be cheaper to allow employees to unionize pay benefits etc vs blow more on anti unionization consultations idk
completely unrelated to the content of the tweet but that s the father of sam reich ceo of college humor
if they can keep people down for only mil they are never gonna have unions gotta make it expensive enough for shareholders to care their employees aren t even in the game let alone got a chance at winning
removed
amazon has about 1m employees after you weed out the corporate big wigs and the tech part of the company getting paid figures 14m to spend towards labor means every would get a year or at an hourly rate and increase of it s still way cheaper for them to spend million on anti labor than anything a union would negotiate i m all about union power and getting people the right compensation but stupid numbers like this undermine the cause and make people look like rubes and hillbillies who fail to understand anything about math the economy or business don t let them slander you as idiots by falling for these types of arguments the real argument is that you are a human and deserving of a good life in exchange for your labor
unfortunately that s how it ll always be the little guy will always get squished money talks and pay offs always happen

to who would win in a fight who could produce more products who has more labor power if the didn t come to work tomorrow would it have more or less impaxt than the not coming to work could those people manage to generate all the same ideas or more as the
exactly why i never ever use amazon for anything
and the money spent on blocking unions is tax deductable
it s just so wild to think about all the potential we have to be great and it s a few greedy assholes who hold us back it would be amazing to see companies like this organize a company wide walk out
fun fact monopoly hasbro profited off the highlight of this problem
your giant corporation doesn t care about you and only sees you as a drone who would of guessed
there needs to be a worldwide end to right wing ideology whatever it takes no matter the cost
they wouldn t need unions if they did something honorable like not getting paid more than x than your lowest employee
just to play devils advocate if amazons ceo was gruesomely murdered and his salary dispersed over the entire companies employees they would each get per employee in anti union consultants
i have lived in a right to work state for my entire adult life i am also a teacher and belong to the local teachers union we are at the mercy of the local school district and are not allowed to engage in any job action because we are critical workers if we do we lose our jobs and our pensions as time goes on i have watched my children and other young adults struggle to earn a decent wage so they can start families and adult lives while these goals move further and further out of reach i have become more and more pro union because that s the only way i see workers gaining any kind of leverage in this hyper capitalist economy also amazon is up there with microsoft and musk world as the modern version of the evil empire imho
why pay people who work for you when you can pay other people instead
i mean this basically could mean they have employment law attorneys on staff yawn
or why they can t take a piss like a civilized human being
these shithole globalist corporations need to be shut down
dude in the picture has half the money the richest person does dudes poor in comparison no wonder he only tips s
are they using a photo of him waiting in line at the local drive up burger spot with that complaint lol
a picture of billl gates standing in line for something along with someone claiming he s a bad tipper weird combo
the richest man only tips and doesn t waste money on avocado toast that s why he s the richest
it looks like he s at a dicks drive in i ve heard many stories of him being nice to patrons etc but who knows he visited a company i used to work at they told us to stay at our desks while he was there for the illusion effect i suppose he seemed ordinary
iirc it s the wallingford dicks and he didn t send someone else to stand in line for him
r wellthatsucks
we have got to start telling employers to fuck themselves when they post shit like this in a job ad call up ask to talk to hr regarding the ad be like it is absolutely asinine to expect anyone least of all someone with the experience and education necessary for this job to be willing to work for no pay go fuck yourselves and then hang up don t introduce yourself or anything if they ask for a name when they re transfering you to hr just make up one but seriously tell these companies to get fucked enough people start doing this for dumbass job ads like this and they might get it one day
develop pricing strategies to maximize return on investment ok my first strategy is pay your employees so they can develop other strategies
qualifications trust fund or sense of navet
no pay and they want previous experience in the industry
this is what is under qualifications previous experience in marketing or other related fields experience in a managerial role strong project management skills strong leadership qualities deadline and detail oriented
they re going to find out really quickly you get what you pay for
it also requires managerial experience haaaaa
i hope someone fake applies and runs them around after getting all their passwords
people haven t changed in years individuals have pushed what defines to be human every which way since then but people as a collective have not changed in years people are greedy and will choose themselves over the benefit of others every time it s so consistent you can practically set a watch to it only the increments are in thousands of years and not minutes or hours people who hoard wealth and resources never seem to learn that they ve taken too much until it s ripped away and redistributed
people are greedy and will choose themselves over the benefit of others every time citation needed
read the article
citation still needed
do we work for the same company this sounds like something my current managers would do
if a company can exploit you they will of the time
truth i ve been that hardworking coworker i ve busted my ass for years at my current employer taking on more and more responsibility and teaching myself to use multiple pieces of software because training and professional development is nonexistent i m damn good at my job at this point my responsibilities are on par with a position in the administration but at half the pay and with no change in position what have i gotten for all my hard work an unmanagable workload burnout and worsening mental and physical health issues we got two new hires both with more than a decade less experience than i have and they were hired on at the same salary as i am currently in fact my salary was bumped up so they could pay a kid fresh out of college with no experience the same as me so i m fucking done and i m currently looking for another job i m the only person who does what i do or knows how to do it and i haven t written down a shred of documentation when i go all that knowledge is going with me petty and unfair to the other employees maybe but idgaf this organization has shown me time and time again that they don t give a shit about me i owe them nothing ok rant over
coverage isn t your responsibility if they re going to pull a team player card then you should expect the team captain to have a big enough team to play the game
nope start sharing responsibility to care for your elderly grandmother sorry i have to take grandma to her doctor s appointment i m busy today taking care of grandma she s starting to have more health issues and needs a lot more help these days etc
well they can expect it until their ass bleeds doesn t mean they are going to get it
coverage for the store and someone else s kids aren t your responsibility i never offer to cover either
when i was in high school i worked for walmart my primary role was as a cashier i was one of the top cashiers as far as speed and accuracy when our cart guy would miss i was tasked with going out and retrieving carts before those nice powered devices i didn t make as much as some of the people that were only cashiers and i was one of only a couple of guys that were tasked with having to go out and retrieve carts from the parking lot i m sure if i had made the money that reflected my versatility someone would ve cried foul my point in this is that managers don t know how to pay their employees based on ability you should be making more money based on your flexibility as a matter of fact i would insist that i get a raise or threaten to leave one thing to remember if you are going to present an ultimatum to your manager then it is imperative that you have something lined up or enough money to coast till the next job comes around
tell them you need the extra time to figure out how to get busy making kids so that you can take advantage of those sweet benefits of having other people do your work for you disclaimer i have a kid but do not understand why management does not maintain extra staffing in order to accommodate people rather than just unfairly pushing others harder when life happens
this quickly devolves into hating people who have kids don t do that the reason you aren t getting flexibility is your employer not your colleagues
you dont have to do it for your manager but how about a little solidarity with your coworkers who are in a pinch and need covered
i have a child now never asked for time off to take to ball games chess tournaments scout things i did tell my supervisor that i needed the weekend off because of eagle scout project no problem if he was sick i would stay home first day dad would take family sick days for the rest so yeah i get it just keep shouting from mountain top i deserve to have as much time off as the people with kids keep telling your boss and upper management no i will not take extra shifts because a person with a child needs to go do something fun with their child children
that s the trouble with being reliable it s not praised it s punished with more responsibility
don t let them use you like this people who expect this treatment will take a mile when you give an inch don t give them an inch
at the very least offer double overtime
i ve thought about something like this before but i don t owe anyone an explanation true or otherwise no is a complete answer whether my coworkers like it or not
can confirm this works great or just lying about having a kid if you are not particularly close with coworkers
but do not understand why management does not maintain extra staffing in order to accommodate people they d rather hassle the people they have than pay for an additional person
i don t hate my coworkers with kids even though some of them are extremely entitled but they re not worth the energy a couple of them are very resentful of me though but again not worth my time or energy
i used to but i m older now and time is more valuable to me than ever and i m not going to spend a second more of it at work than i have to i also got tired of entitled coworkers always expecting sometimes even demanding that i cover for them
triple
sure
you have a hole financial burden you aren t dealing with i would hate you too
i m sure they re jealous of all the spare time you have to waste complaining on reddit
i quit after years of hr a week and started my own business in my profession work about 24hr week now and no bad management ruining my week
contact hr and discuss your grievance with them they will hopefully have a recruitment policy which doesn t include nepotism
they never move good workers off the shifts they find hard to fill it doesn t make short term business sense and they don t actually care about the future only today s profit people remember the politician that cuts the ribbon not the one that got the project off the ground in the 1st place
i left my last job for the same reason i was struggling after a new baby wanted off permanent nights at least temporarily they refused i was too valuable where i was i asked for a long overdue raise they couldn t do that either they were surprised when i quit
sometimes antiwork is really just anti shitty people sorry that your supervisor sucks
i hear you sometimes you have to adopt the mess around and find out attitude your manager messed around now he s going to find out
don t quit just yet bring it up with hr and if you can consult a lawyer
that s why we need unions
funny you assume hard work matters in this world it s all about nepotism make friends and hope one of those friends is a manager or ceo then you can get a great job for free but if you re like me and not relatable to most people you re probably stuck as a wagie
the problem is they probably need you on night shift because it s harder to fill so moving you creates more problems than it solves
good that you re leaving and tell him to fuck off on the way out the door
this is when i start taking one foot out the door but bring it up to them and say hey that s bullshit
when you outperform your peers you make yourself too valuable to be moved somewhere else why move you when you killing it in this department and the boss doesn t have to worry about it if you work smart instead of just working hard you ll be in a better position no one will replace you if you re doing something no one else can do right x200b i ve worked hard most of my life and i m now in my 40s it hasn t really paid off unless you happen to work for your dad
tale as old as time it s not what you know it s who you blow sorry to hear that s how things shook out for you op but you re correct in wanting to seek greener pastures
yup sadly a lot of companies thrive on mediocrity the only way you move up is either if you know somebody or kiss ass and the people who work the hardest either quit or get burned out keep looking you ll find something better
par for the course
lol
unless this job is covered by a union with clout he is not going to get anywhere with hr or anyone this is just one of the purposes of a labor union
nepotism only applies to family members this would be considered favoritism
this is the truth i was the only one who would work overnight audit in a hotel and they wouldn t let me move even to mid day no one wanted the shift
why do idiots default to get a lawyer every time they see any kind of injustice what legal claim to that position does op have none x200b what damages have been incurred by op on behalf of either the manager or the company none x200b what business does op have getting a lawyer involved none x200b x200b get a grip dude
this is accurate the thought hr gives two shts for op
nep o tism neptiz  m noun the practice among those with power or influence of favoring relatives friends or associates especially by giving them jobs friends are included
yep they are going to keep you on that shift until you refuse to do it anymore the other one is you are doing most of the work on floor because you are more efficient that in your team if they promote you they loose efficiency so they will promote a person less suitable if this happens to you you have to leave this company if you ever want a promotion because it ain t going to happen yes they do value you but they value you in this position
hey you just called that guy an idiot i m calling a lawyer
i m pretty sure suggesting calling a lawyer on antiwork equals karma minimum i work in this field when you call the receptionist at the firm will ask for details about your situation only if the lawyer finds it has possible merit and enough damages will they initiate a free consultation in general lawyers don t have an obligation to waste their time giving free consults to every karen who thinks not getting the extra pickles they ordered is a hate crime
a lot of lawyers will give you a consultation for free the op could ask if this could be a constructive dismissal the op is planning to quit over this issue i didn t say sue the employer so you are the one who needs to get a grip
ah okay that i did not know i stand corrected
you can always seek some grounds for a civil suit but legally speaking nepotism isn t even a labor violation it s not illegal even for public officials the guidelines in my own state specify spouse or dependent relative
exactly it s a complete waste of time and effort on both sides for this person to even bother picking up the phone and calling a lawyer s office the fact he thinks otherwise does nothing other than make him look delusional it s bad advice straight up
constructive dismissal in employment law constructive dismissal also called constructive discharge or constructive termination occurs when an employee resigns as a result of the employer creating a hostile work environment since the resignation was not truly voluntary it is in effect a termination did you even google this before you spouted off about it the resignation is voluntary in the scenario op laid out quitting because you didn t get something you want is not tantamount to a constructive dismissal being forced to quit because of a hostile work environment is this is not even in the same universe when you say someone should get a lawyer the implication is that they should be seeking some some sort of legal action you didn t say it explicitly but you implied it in the real world those two things are not wildly different the fact that you implied it instead of directly saying they should sue doesn t prevent you from being laughably wrong here hence my assertion that you re an idiot x200b don t like it get a lawyer lol
dude this b reddit you re supposed to double down and never admit your wrong you re doin reddit wrong
i said consult a lawyer not get not sue stop reading between the lines you dumb clown you must have really small hands you baby dick smooth brain go back to your mom s basement loser hahaha
wow you re a massive dick the person suggested a consultation i fail to see why your responsive is so hostile and aggressive if you re going to insist it s actually not that will explain the rest but you should know you come across as a massive asshole do what you will with that i expect it will be very little
nepotism is that ice cream that has a chocolate section a vanilla section and a strawberry section prove me wrong
yes please agree to disagree for goodness sake
wow i seem to really have upset you by not being super nice while pointing out that you re an idiot perhaps you should consult a lawyer
you expect correctly x200b people who come on forums like this and advise others to seek out a lawyer for day to day normal sh t are a menace nothing requires me to be nice about putting these people in their place if someone is going to go about their day acting a fool i don t see why i should be nice when pointing it out to them a rando on the internet thinking i m a dick does not concern me at all
i m glad you informed me how much you don t care i m sure you don t if only you understood the difference between a consultation and filing a lawsuit you re the menace lol get over yourself
you sound angry perhaps you should consult an attorney
elated that just reads like someone who thinks you can use a thesaurus to choose a better word to sound smarter and it doesn t change the meaning of the word at all there s a big difference between happy or comfortable with the prospect of monitoring and someone who is elated kinda laughing imagining someone actually displaying elation in an interview when this is brought up
what kind of exhibitionist weirdo would be elated they used such an unusual word for emphasis as in if you agree to this you are just the sucker they were looking for
i would sooner piss on my own face than pretend to be happy with this tone deaf productivity milking bullshit
i ve never been elated for anything involving a job
working with
i want an app at work that tells me how long i ve pooped at work annually
i orgasm by the prospect of
ah the study that ran for a single month with no control group think about this realistically these greedy executives and shareholders only want more money for themselves if they could get more with less overhead and turnover they would there s a reason they don t and it s not because they put evil above money the money is all they care about perhaps we need to consider that the study is flawed and re run it with better configuration
this is a common study that people refer to when saying that going to a day work week will increase productivity it s really not going to it s hard to measure productivity simply by sales which this study does sales can increase for many different reasons outside of productivity like inflation increased prices increased demand etc it s also important to note why employees may be more production in this case they eliminated a lot of meetings it s likely they took other measures to increase efficiency too there are many advantages to going to a day work week but increased productivity isn t going to be a real one it s more likely to lead to a loss of productivity overall as many jobs will lose production with one less day like mechanics or dental offices
i think you underestimate cultural inertia and hubris not to mention simply i had to work a shitty days so you should too regardless of what the data says
silence shill
i don t understand what you mean by control group isn t the control group the multiple decades that microsoft has existed i do agree that the study is flawed but having a control group isn t it
then they would be cycled out shareholders don t care what the ceo went through they care about money and nothing else if this was true every shareholder would immediately be for it and demanding it if their executives to make more money
since the market company policies macro trends and seasonality all play a factor a suitable control group would be having and studying a part of the group that remained days a week to standardize the workload and factors present by shutting down the whole office you miss this key part of any experiment
dude what magic world do you live in where humans always make logical efficient and fact based decisions look at pro sports for example most major american sports leagues have some sort of salary cap because these titans of industry can t be trusted to run the payrolls of their own franchises so no i don t think just because you can show some data you can easily or on a whim end something like the day work week once again you really underestimate cultural inertia this is the way we have always done it here at the sprocket factory
i think we re seeing that s not the case with work from home
your explanation makes no sense
because all the shareholders care about is money major league sports is non public unionized and heavily public subsidized they answer to no one so long as they line the politicians pocket or bully the city council that s why the union imposed caps this is not the case in most business in business you are either small which if you take too much you fail or you re large and have a structure where the board and shareholders are in charge they only care about money so if a proposal comes through that isn t flawed they will take the money every single time they are selfish and greedy they care not about feelings or culture
because all the shareholders care about is money right and since they re not human but a i that make absolutely rational decisions with no margin for error and no cultural or innate biases affect their decisionmaking this definitely matt wait they re human not a i and they do have biases that affect their decisionmaking potentially including biases like the simple acceptance of the way things are done a lot of those people are people who inherited their money and have continued to make more of it by simply doing what their dads told them to do with it and never really thought through the mechanics of an economy and how it could be improved to make them more money large wide scale change is hard and risky and most already wealthy people see the system as generally working and have little incentive to risk change to an easy stream of income my dude we ve already seen this with covid they had the chance after transitioning to wfh to cancel paying for office spaces they no longer needed once statistics showed workers often worked better from home and needed far less oversight and far less upkeep from the company to continue functioning at an accelerated rate so why are they so keen to bring people back to the office knowing that it will cost them money reduce productivity and increase turnover on top of it all because by and large most business leaders making those calls aren t basing the decision on numbers but on wanting a return to what they perceive as normalcy such is the power of cultural inertia you can cite numbers all you want but you re trying to argue away the human element and that s just not how the world actually works
the union imposed caps players unions fight salary caps why would they limit the earning potential of their members you re a tedious person
well said
well latisha as a shift lead who gets paid hr with overtime at a small local restaurant your hr shit pay and your belittlement to your staff is the reason why people quit your damn fucking job you have several applications to look at good for you once you tell them your pay then you ll see their asses out the door with better opportunities to arise ps latisha gth
i cannot get over the terrible writing in that notice that alone speaks volumes
dunkin bc i m having trouble with my dd rn never ends
threatening your hr wage as if it s some great opportunity that s the right way to treat people certainly won t make everyone who has to deal with you resent you over time
best part is i eventually did just walk out because they had fired my friend for a very stupid reason and now that woman messages me like every two or three months trying to get me to come back lmao i will open this store and close it everyday before i allow my employees to think they run my store direct quote from her about a month before i quit and the funniest part is she ended up having to do just that for months because she ran off everyone worth a damn not a unique story unfortunately
they are all the same if i can give you any advice leave as soon as possible i ve worked at multiple and have zero idea how they are for one open and two not shut down for breaking soooo many labor laws
the restaurant owner deserved it
why the employees who work there are out of work
to be fair the restaurant employees are also probably striking
the restaurant workers are probably the ones who torched the place
you are not alone
no wonder it was cut from future reruns cause it was all true fucking hell
if it wasn t posted already the folks at r obscuremedia would love this
wow that is extensive i d like to show this to some people
every tv funhouse ad and cartoon are on a dvd i have from the early 2000s quite avant garde even for the 1990s when the majority of them were released
how do you download this
adam mckay the director of step brothers and the other guys helped write this skit i heard him talk about it on chapo trap house he was very proud of it
how did snl go from this to being trash
unfortunately this is how most companies operate check out who owns the various food businesses yes there are different logos at the grocery store but if you walk backward there are only around four brands
many reddit video download services out there google it
i bet this had something to do with it

this organizing wave is so dumb all these waves are in singular pools it d be great to see a giant multi industry splash
i also work in industrial automation in an engineering position and i had to complete a competency exam exactly like that before i started the position i m in now was a bit annoying but not a huge deal
once i applied to a job did an interview that went well had a few drinks with my wife that friday night and nodded off on the couch i work up around am and checked my phone i saw the potential employer sent me a link i tapped it without reading the email and found myself half in the bag and really sleepy taking the goddam timed sat like a fucking nightmare i ran to the kitchen and drank some old coffee grabbed a pad of paper for the math portion and after screwing up the first few questions ended up with a good enough score to get hired i m guessing the job pays well go get it just be psychopathically confident it works if you can maintain it throughout the interview process
what does it even ask you
in my experience it was just a simple learning aptitude which was why it wasn t a big deal it felt more like a formality but it did take about an hour
it s not the worst they could ask and i m sure i d do fine however i think it s silly to ask so much extra with no guarantee it ll provide results i ve already shown my resume and my project code
yeah it absolutely is silly i wouldn t blame you for taking issue with that
you know what that s it no more buying from bezos here easy peasy if others will do the same but even if not done is done here no sense of loss salute
tyt railing against union busting is funny what with how cenk feels about his staff unionizing these bourgeoisie hypocrites only want your money and attention they don t care about the working class
why they would rather pay union busters then employees i ll never know it s greed plain and simple
wait till op finds out about tyt union busting i m not a fan of unions cenk
that s rich coming from them cenk did everything he could to try stop his staff from unionizing
tyt also union busts
i wonder if the anti union consultants are part of a union
didn t tyt bust their own union lol hypocrites
fuck tyt and cenk who also tried their own union busting
many people that shop on amazon are damn near addicted to it unfortunately some of those people are my friends if they aren t doom scrolling on fb they are just paging through a bunch of crap on amazon telling me about all the deals they see and adding it to a cart they have no intentions of actually buying it s really fucking weird imo and only brings up dystopian thoughts
genuine question why not invest that money into their employees just seems like a waste to pay dudes who teach you how to piss off your people
i thought we cancelled tyt kasparian when she recently jk rowling d or when she claimed to grow up working class to parents who owned multiple california properties or when her parents allegedly bankrolled a news network for her but yeah fuck amazon still
goddamn i haven t seen the young turks in a minute i can see how much the stress of her job has aged ana that is a woman who has been staring into the void a long time now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjuzkleneoo
the simple answer which i don t understand why common everyday workers don t understand is if they re fighting you this hard against something having you go to meetings that are hours long firing people from mentioning the word union hiring consultants then that obviously means the union is something worth having
amazon made workers pay back there 2k sign on bonus if they got any part of it and didn t make it a full year of employment which if you ve ever worked at amazon you know that shit kills ya legs and feet
how many of you are actually going to stop buying from amazon
canceled my prime almost two years ago truly evil company
boycott
i mean is this really surprising so what exactly is new and what are people going to do with this information amazon can do this in broad daylight with literally the entire world present and nothing will happen as long as there are desperate people amazon will still have a limitless supply of slaves
can someone validate that has to be illegal right but also fuck tyt
wait didnt tyt deny the armenian genocide
i don t know what about this screenshot i hate more the headline or the fact it s from the young turks
hell yeah tyt
there is alot of shit talking about amazon but reddit is a huge customer of aws
even as a liberal tyt is bigoted trash chenk is literally the alex jones of the left
i m usually bot happen when i buy things from amazon
good good direct your hate towards company x or y never towards the government that allows this to happen be good puppies and play the game the media makes you play while the real problem is free to do as it pleases
posting a youtube video as an ad
meh they have a point of view you have a point of view talk it out find fair if you lose the debate leave be brave just walk away the business will collapse then nobody wins no jobs no cheap groceries no utility clothes
that number is surprisingly low
now if they spent that money on their employees they wouldn t have to worry about unions
deleted
could you imagine a law that requires how much a company spends on lobbying on their web page
union
i ve never bought anything from amazon and i actively encourage others to do the same it s difficult it s impossible but i do it anyway fucking parasite of humanity
tyt is literal dogshit
wait wait wait i can pretend to be an anti union consultant and just give bad advice right
it s really not that hard i order something from amazon maybe once every two or three months could totally go elsewhere and get the same stuff for about the same price just hadn t been motivated until seeing this i ll try to cut it to absolutely nothing from amazon don t have or want their tv service don t need to shop their website don t need whatever the hell else they offer as those are the only two things i m aware of sadly i know people that order from them practically every day but i m still going to do my part i can think of a few that i may be able to influence in a better direction as well down with billionaires they do not deserve our money or respect or time they are parasites actually worse than parasites as atleast parasites die when they kill their hosts
it s just too easy to get what i want delivered in a matter of like a day and a half but i mean if people just stopped working for him it d be a different story
i may get downvoted for this but it is hard and will progressively get harder because we ve allowed amazon to have a virtual e commerce monopoly
e commerce is only like off amazon s revenue more than half comes from web hosting which includes reddit not saying you should buy from them but there s more to it
i stopped because it s just a glorified flea market with shit products oh and ya fuck besos
im surprised people don t troll amazon by leaving union fliers plastered outside their gates or under employees windshield wipers considering how crazy they go at the slightest hint of union activity this seems like a great low cost way to get them waisting time on an illusionary game of whack a mole
it s totally doable we went item by item and found what we needed either from local shops or other more ethical companies takes a bit of time and effort but it feels pretty good to know bezos isn t getting our money anymore one drop in the bucket but it all adds up
i haven t bought from amazon for years people will still find an excuse to buy from them though and that s the problem
i stopped buying from amazon last year
years ahead of you buddy
the true difference between neo liberals and progressives
just another liberal
because if you break the amount they spent on union busters down to the employees it wouldn t make enough of a difference that the employees would care it s cheaper to pay the union busters than the employees if that weren t the case they would it always just comes down to what puts the most money in the company s pocket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smlah2a87ek&ab\_channel=iatselocal700organizingdepartment
anti union consultants should be illegal if union busting is against the law why not the anti union consultants
wait you cant be working class and own more than one property someone makes one tone deaf tweet and shes cancelled it really wasnt that bad
what did she say far as i know which isn t much since i only watch that on youtube once every few months she s been doing her journalism thing for a while now and isn t exactly rolling in wealth because of it
what was the jk rowling move she blocked my suspended account when i kept calling her out on her views on crime and prison
its illegal to union bust but not illegal to hire consultants who can find loopholes around those laws
youre high af
can we have both ie calling out govt and amazon yes amazon had the permissive environment to do as they ve done but they still made the choice
yes until amazon we walked about unfed and unwashed for we could not afford the tallow to make soap and the chinese empire guarded the secrets of silk worms
youre brave or paid to shill
their retail division doesn t produce much profit for them as a percentage not buying from them isn t exactly denting them they make money whenever you go onto the internet so you ll have to give up internet
the problem for me is that there are things that i cannot find except on amazon
once or twice a year there s something i need delivered quickly that i can t buy locally so i use a friend s account for free day prime delivery i don t feel great about it but it sure is convenient when you re in a pinch if there were another option for situations like that other than paying a ridiculous amount for overnight shipping from somewhere else i d do that
hell twitch as well i imagine makes them a good chunk of change
wow this minute video with little to no fact based evidence completely convinced me that cenk is a union buster s
correct being a scummy landlord is not working class if you can afford multiple properties you are not working class and certainly not working class poor as she phrased it in the past and yes if you make an terrible statement you are probably a terrible person
that s literally fucking insane
not as high as you apparently if your listen to the insistent ramblings of tyt
most will make this choice if allowed
please have the maturity to recognize that my comment is within the context of the labor dispute also recognize the market share this behemoth commands that would be disrupted until another non union shop replaced it and then the madness begins anew mom pop shops aren t coming back
look harder
my mom bought a house and i m considering eventually buying land literally 10k most cars cost more than that so my family would have multiple properties my mom s disabled and i m a bartender i suspect we may indeed be working class
i work with guys in a factory who own multiple properties theyre definitely working class lol
my man no one on tyt has said anything nearly as crazy as alex jones least crazy take
maybe i was a little too snarky accept my apologies but i don t think the situation would be as cut and dry as you suggest amazon acts like a distribution network to some extent a highly efficient one for sure but if it collapsed we wouldn t suffer from a lack of products we d suffer from inefficient distribution also i don t think an overnight collapse represents a probable scenario i agree that mom pop shops aren t coming back without a significant political battle which i doubt will happen
that the armenian genocide by the turks didn t happen
accepted very classy you are absolutely correct in the role of amazon in product logistics it is very similar to fedex or the us oil pipeline network sure consumers could get products but at a price and with delays if there is a negative impact from unionization i anticipate like you that the effect will be gradual mirroring the decline in automobile mfg in michigan hagd
i think he recanted that but meh show is mostly talking heads bitching about other taking heads anyway
are you asking me
you too
no pay only work
the needs of the business what about my needs bitch
work more hours no not those hours
apparently nobody wants to work so good luck hiring and thanks for advising all part timers that they are better off elsewhere and should get their cvs out there
whaaaaaaaat
it s all bout the needs of the business until it comes time for raises it s really all about the needs of the shareholders owners
i had a manager puff up and say we only work 8s around here i just smiled and sad yeah i only work 6s
if a part time employee is qualifying for overtime they aren t a part time employee
we scheduled too many because we obviously aren t coming in so please stop doing that of which we asked fixing drones dude
pizza place
huh
i don t think that these are from the same break room makes sense since this is a repost bot
i mean the second poster makes perfect sense if your availability is restricted to certain hours then the employer needs to hire people who can work the hours needed to be covered which means less hours to be spread across all employees in the end that s just the way it works
tldr reliability works both ways
they sure are asking for a whole lotta giving a shit when they ain t offering any
this is a great demonstration of how greed works in these businesses with hours of your store being open you could hire two full time shifts and then incentivize them to be dependable by giving them good wages and benefits the scheduling problems would be gone because the employees would be invested in being good workers hiring full time workers would make things easier for everybody
won t pay ot won t work a minute extra pretty simple math
what do you mean you want free time
we only need you to work hours this week with no overtime pay if you don t care about your job just say it
pesky time half
we actually had an employee get fired bc she had an allergic reaction to her laundry detergent and couldnt come in after being put on a final for emailing hr about going on bereavement instead of calling the store or doing a paper request
we have a couple on overnights that come in and stay until the full timers leave and don t even get the benefits fts have
worse big retail
i can assure you these are from the same break room lmao
it is wildly unreasonable to tell a part timer to be available from 6am when the sun is rising to 10pm then the sun has long set this poster only makes sense if you re the asshole who made it
i can see the device id in the first picture i hope that doesn t track back to you
same
indeed though they do have more labor protections than we do so that gives them more security to do what they are doing our workers are also far more beat down it s going to take one hell of a catalyst but it will happen here hopefully soon
same
what really did happen to americans one moment their dumping tea in boston harbor or rioting after martin luther king was shot the next moment they re saying anything outside a permitted peaceful protest is illegitimate and not the way to change things what gives american s motivation for protest has been neutered
why aren t you out there
i sadly completely agree with you it s been demonized by both corporate mouth pieces
i don t live in paris
the management needs to remove their heads from their own bottoms although being up there so long they may need to be surgically removed
if these companies were drugs they would be class a and banned why is there no law against it too many of us suffer at their realm it has to stop bring on licenses for managers and ceos sort yourself out or you lose your right to operate we need an app that can auto record when harassment keywords are picked up and the ability to send their abuse to an independent employment review board for intervention to enforce retraining prosecutions or a complete closure of the company it will happen and their days are numbererd
i completely understand the importance of fighting for change but we also need to consider the impact that a strike could have on the children many families rely on schools to provide necessary care and meals for their children if all teachers go on strike there will be hundreds of millions of kids left at home alone some without access to basic needs this is especially concerning for younger children who may be at risk of abuse with no one to intervene i urge you to consider alternative methods of advocating for change that do not disrupt the education and well being of children we need to work together to find a solution that benefits both teachers and students
they robbed us that s why
this is no surprise
they re trying to cut their losses liability not sure of the legalities my father always told me when i was younger to never tell a potential employer that i take anti depressants
i think i would seek legal advice you didn t mention the type of work you did that might make a difference
never tell a potential employer that i take anti depressants i won t make that mistake twice that s what i get for confiding in a supervisor
they re gonna do whatever ever they can to get a leg up and make themselves look good
like they pulled a columbo and figured you out
i only recently joined the sub but i still try to do my part by only browsing and commenting on work hours
what s it telling you
million is still a very small part of the workforce
i was a complete capitalist supporter till i got into this sub it has seriously changed my outlook to the way i see work
honestly this sub was a lot more fun when it was anarchist and around 500k subscribers
eh it doesn t really mean anything
i think the base assumption all the members are idle is a misconception i actually feel quite fulfilled at my current job pay is decent in general unrelated circumstances around a death of coworker have my pay substantially low vs responsibilities but hope to resolve soon they let me have the flexibility i need etc media portrays quiet quitting as not doing your job my perhaps dated understanding is quiet quitting is doing exactly your responsibility list and nothing more i also recognize i am likely in the minority but strongly believe in workers rights the term idlers just hit me wrong i guess i m far from idle and don t want folks to give into the media bias that we are all lazy
a lot of people lost their jobs during covid when they went back to work they decided gee it was better when i didn t have responsibilities and could just do what i wanted all day
the news story brought me here i share the same hatred for the way companies operate though
the number of unhappy poverty living workers is staggering france is doing something about it what are american workers doing accept suffering as the rich go to space and waste millions of dollars that could house and feed our entire country
it s almost like the failures of capitalism are compounding on each other and more and more people are recognizing it
it s telling me that the workers of the world are finally realizing the hokum we ve been fed
all the subs supposed to be edgy and subversive got too popular which drug them back in line with our american overton window i got banned from fuckcars because i was upset with somebody who brigaded different subs to follow me across the site for the rousing crime of supporting public transit and saying that drivers will always say they need another lane i mentioned in my comment that got me banned that i was being stalked across subs but oh well the fuckcars way is rewarding harassment with tea and cookies now apparently
the term idlers is what the founders of this community call members i just recently noticed that under the about community side bar and it looks like those of currently active on the the site are not working i agree with you don t want those uppity types to be thinking we are lazy
i don t think it s as much about shirking responsibilities as it is realizing that the hamster wheel was not getting them anywhere
still not enough not enough until haze is too stifling too ignore from even the mountaintops of hoarded treasure but a start
oh we been there just waiting for the catalyst
it s probably a combination of both
if she lives in an at will state they can just fire her if they feel like it so yes it s probably legal in some states it s considered disability discrimination if they discriminate against her because they perceive her to have a disability i m not sure if being sick with the flu counts as that if they didn t put her on the schedule because they think she s sickly then maybe
does she have a contract or a union
your girlfriend s former employer is disgusting
it s legal but holy shit is it awful
it s wild to read about this stuff happening in america in nz the doctors note rules over everything else
in china if you have a contract just sue that school you will get compensation
that doesn t make sense getting written up for speaking to people in a language they understand what is management thinking
would be interesting to know if management does that for all languages other than english or just some cough racism specific languages
depending on the motivation it is generally not legal however in a broad sense spoken language is not protected by most discrimination laws in canada workers can be terminated or penalized if their language negatively interferes with the task they have been assigned if it does not interfere with the tasks assigned then you likely have a case of discrimination but it would be difficult to prove
sounds like a language and or racial discrimination complaint to me if your employer doesn t allow people to speak a foreign language even though the customers clearly need help that just seems wrong you city or province may have some kind of civil rights or human rights office you can file an anonymous complaint to
i imagine only if they could prove you were saying bad or threatening things otherwise flat out ask whoever is writing you up for them to point out in the handbook where it says english only
can t be written up for something if there s not a policy or procedure against it she should just ask the manager where it says in the handbook she is forbidden to speak another language
even if it s legal pretty sure it isn t legal this is a terrible business strategy being polylingual is a great strength it literally means you can effectively do business sales with more people the manager is a prick who is probably limited in general intelligence full of insecurities self doubt
i speak english a coworker of mine would start talking her native language when she wanted to talk to customers about me and how stupid i was well after about times i would quit bagging for her and she got mad and said it was my job i told her in front of store manager that i do not have to bag for her because she constantly puts me down and bad mouths me manager said he was on my side and just let him know if it happened again she eventually transferred to a different store and city
if the rule is against speaking then just write any customer using the language a note explaining that you understand them but management name drop for added effect has forbidden you from speaking their language the problem will soon fix itself
yeah ikr
a large chunk of our employees speak punjabi so that s the only other language being spoken
in this case it would positively interfere assistance in a language customers understand as opposed to a lack of communication
my manager is otherwise really great both to work with and as a person but apparently a non existent policy and customer complaints means it s required to give a written warning
is it some like racism stuff
cops it s cops isn t it
it s always cool as long as you don t need them as references do it
not bad of you at all like at all you owe them nothing you worked they paid you that s where it ends no obligation to them at all
no it s not horrible of you unless you signed a contract if you ve signed a contract then you re legally bound to work the length of that contract or there will be penalties the last place i worked at was so bad that after i put in my two weeks notice the other two people in my group gave a one day notice and quit if it s a crummy situation get out of there why even give them two days they don t owe you anything and you don t owe them anything unless you want to work there again at some point in the future and you don t want to burn your bridges just say i m all done i won t be coming in anymore here s where to mail my last check
i would be looking for another job already please don t stay in a job that you hate take care and good luck with your work dm me the name of the shop and i will write a review
why should teenagers get hr flipping burgers they don t need that much money that s not a career they should get an education ok let s make college affordable since you can t put your way through college by working part time in the summer anymore no that s socialism colleges are part of the free market and i m not paying for someones fancy degree if they want an education they should have to pay for it like everyone else ok you don t want people to live off minimum wage and you don t want to help regulate college tuition what would you do then get into the trades it s good money so you expect all young people to get into a trade if they don t want to starve live with their parents roommates forever or be indebted for life literally a conversation between me and my mom who retired with a pension after dropping out of high school and working as a forklift driver for years before effectively retiring to be a home maker the cognitive dissonance is insane
they know
they have real estate portfolios they know they don t want to do anything to make rent go down they cheer california prices coming to the rest of the country
part of the problem is the people who vote for those people still think rent is month the politicians know exactly what they are doing and who their audience is
had a conversation with my grandmother the other day where i asked her what she d do if she lost her house she said she d just go down to publix and get a job bagging groceries and use that to save money as a down payment for a new house i laughed and said there s no way she could afford a house by bagging groceries and she answered that she didn t mind getting a smaller house than what she has now i said no you wouldn t get any house and she just shrugged and said she wouldn t mind a small condo or townhouse then i said nope can t afford those either and she still just replied that she s not materialistic and would find something it s unreal how they just refuse to admit that housing is unaffordable now
many of them know rent is a lot more than a month because they are collecting rents
simple answer is stop voting in these old out of touch morons
old often wealthy politicians who are completely out of touch with the real world are a huge problem in every country
part of the problem is the politicians do know how horrible rent prices have become and they simply do not give a fuck
they aren t dumb they know rent isn t a month their friends are telling them how they re renting out their apartment complexes and charging per room
lol i can t believe that argument cause half of them are the landlords and damn well know what they re charging is insane
and the other half are narcissistic privileged fucks
where i live you can t even rent a bedroom for mo and i m not talking about a single bedroom place no i m talking about _just the f king bedroom_ in a shared accommodation situation you want a single bedroom place double it for an illegal basement suite with highly questionable liveability triple it for a legal suite that doesn t have mould or vermin issues and was built within the last
this assumes the politicians making these laws were ever subject to minimum wage conditions ever had to pay rent instead of collecting it
our rent has increased four years in a row it s now deposit also raised so another unexpected car repair another unexpected thing was most of these in jan feb my wages didn t increase my power bill is super high now calif been looking for affordable housing but mostly mobile homes and family parks here are expensive i am more valuable dead than alive
no they just don t give a shit about the working class don t give them an out
i believe it is more than half of our stupid politicians
nah it s mostly the capitalists who bought them constantly screaming every dollar you give them is a dollar you can t give me
no it s not the boomers please it s people who decided they know best and have zero empathy or understanding of the value of human labor zero
they re shitheads cuz most of the time others they prevent making more money has nothing to do with how much they could make themselves so there s no reason to say my first job paid x when they re making several hundred k now and giving someone a bigger raise has no effect on their salary look at california prop written by old people that don t want to pay their fair share of property tax so they said they won t pay shit and let younger poorer people who they actively prevent from making more money then foot their property tax bills for them absolute shitheads
i wish i could upvote this times
honest question shouldn t more of the minimum wage burden be place on the state i feel like the feds are just setting a super minimum safety net and i get that it s not enough but they also take all the flack why isn t that anger and energy aimed at each state s government if the fed minimum wage isn t enough to live on in a given state shouldn t its citizens hold their state level officials responsible
average age of an adult american is all political candidates should fall within years of the average age now how do i buy votes to get that passed
i just had like of my wage just go to bills and my manager just said you should consider that you shouldn t have to use your bonus to subsadise for bills and manage your finances better like what should i do tell my landlord to not expect my rent due to no bonus
a proper and livable wage depending upon area of the nation us is between an hour anyone who doesn t know the economics well enough to readily acknowledge this nor will to go learn for themselves is communicating they have a vested interest in denying the fact time to change this narrative a livable wage is the one responsibility of business to the greater economic whole and it s time to call both bullshit and shenanigans on anyone asserting otherwise https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/11hc3wj/comment/jauf15j/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/11hc3wj/comment/jauf15j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
this is giving those politicians too much credit they know they don t care or they welcome the further growth of inequality
of the politicians in dc pay no rent
jokes aside i wouldn t be surprised if that was the case like most of them probably haven t been to a grocery store in a decade or more they have all their stuff delivered bought by their employees staff for me it s the fact that they are constantly told that people are on the verge of homelessness and starvation and they just elect to ignore that is what drives me into rage
this true they have no concept of the real world either side
no they knew they are insecure about us taking what they ve worked for because they feel that there s not enough to go around and quite frankly with an ever growing population there isn t like imagine if everyone drive around in high priced super cars then old perverts wouldn t be able to attract hot young women with their wealth because men their own age would have wealth of their own if everyone had wealth then maybe more pele would get together out of love rather than who can support their needs
that s an optimistic way of looking at it i think it s more along the lines of that half our politicians are evil and think being poor is a moral failing that needs to be legislatively punished
they also are mainly self interested and growing their own wealth not interested in helping make america what it could be we have so many resources that are wasted by greed and fear
this is a very generous view of things they have shown their hand time and time again it s time we start assuming malice not ignorance
nah they keep voting to increase their own paychecks and or investing in markets they make laws for they re not too old they just don t care about everyone else
oh no they know exactly how much rent is and how much of a percentage of your pay it is they just plum don t give a flying fiddler s fuck if you re not lining their pockets you re just a pawn to be exploited by the people who do
i don t even know if rising the minimum wage by the government does anything if owners were to realize that their employees need to be able to afford a living and maybe gave up on some of the profits and forwarded that towards a normal wage we would have less issues problem is greed at the top level is immense and they would rather buy themselves luxurious items rather than pay their employees properly and then complain that there is no one who wants to work
yo male here when i was i delivered pizzas and was able to get my first apartment for what is in todays dollars a month kids nowadays either need roommates or still live at home doesn t seem fair
i do think it s partly to do with anchoring the brain does their thought on wages are anchored to wha wages use to be to what they are now and appear like your getting paid more one part is ignorance of the subject of inflation and cost of living and all the data involved another part is that many not all of an older generation since the cradles of civilization have thought they are better than the younger generation and have to pat themselves on the back
need i remind you who let inflation run rampant claiming it was transitory
i work hard i m somehow not wealthy the universe owes me who do i blame i know boomers
the majority of the problems started with eve eating the apple and women burning their bra in
it s exactly the problem
only half
nah it s per month for a decent room with all utilities paid
how much could rent cost michael
and it would cause all the other employees that don t earn minimum wage to ask for a raise
sweden doesn t have a minimum wage and don t have a problem
take a note from politicians and just vote for more pay another thing they get is tax payer funded healthcare i know that for sure i am unsure wether or not it s for life but i believe so i know they get paid for life don t worry if they don t vote to change it you can try before your if you live that long
yup
they are all lucille from arrested development how much could a banana cost dollars
back in i remember my best friend s mom losing her mind when her mortgage went up a few dollars to a month i just looked it up and that same house is valued at over k now
or we could be taxed less
where politicians are concerned never attribute to incompetency what you could attribute to maliciousness
either that or they dont care
most of them are landlords they know good and well what rent is
this is not even remotely true the people who decide wages know exactly what they are doing
pfft they know full well how much they re fucking everyone this isn t a problem caused by lack of knowledge it s a problem caused by lack of empathy and greed but that goes without saying lol
they know they just don t care no excuse for being evil
never listen to people who talk about muh trades i found out a construction worker breaks his body for an hour
i hate the just get into trades i m and i spent a couple years working in trades i was trading my physical mental health to get an hour and was still living with parents yay this is the future we all wanted
this exactly my spouse is in a trade i got the degree after years experience to their we make within an hour of each other we both have great credit we both try to work hard i unfortunately have limitations and we both are savers not spenders still can t afford a house every time we get close enough to affording something the bar is raised by another 50k needed and our rent keeps going up just like everything else so each year it feels like we make less and less thanks inflation and we ve been renting the same place for years there is no work hard and succeed there is no extra perk or rewards we still don t get more than a week of pto each year our health insurance is more expensive and covers fewer things my job doesn t even offer retirement death seems like a more welcome escape
they also really didn t work that hard many had harder lives which was true and i m sure was hard for many people but schooling required a fraction of the work many people didn t even go to finish high school and if you had any skills at all you really stuck out and did well now everyone is educated polished and has skills and hence that s why companies don t bother training anyone anymore there s no reason to cuz people come to them highly trained or at least smart enough to learn on the job if you see a boomer now who can t learn anything on the job or takes them forever that was always the case for them when younger they weren t magically sharp in 30s then 50s lost it all it was always that way back then a little bit of work and savings went a longgggg way and the biggest disconnect is the same work and savings goes nowhere now so since they re short sighted and not that sharp they just assume no one bothers to work hard and save when in reality everyone does that they just realize at different times in their lives it gets them nowhere again many young people are faced with do i not buy a house and get a nicer iphone or do i not buy a house and get a cheap android phone and if the answer is you can t buy a house either way of fucking course you re gonna spend on that iphone that s what many boomers don t get when they see kids with nice phones and god forbid avocado toast but with no house just one of many examples but it s the best explanation for why kids buy stuff seemingly in excess but also can t afford major life purchases
get into a trade and join a union sounds like a plan
get into the trades it s good money a few years later well i learned a trade but that work only pays minimum wage it turns out that since everybody my age went into the trades there s way more workers than there is demand for trade work well that s just economics supply and demand that s why you need an education now y all gonna make college affordable nooooooooo socialism
you forgot the get into the trades and make okay money but decrease your life expectancy by about years bit
you guys don t go to trade school
ok let s make college affordable since you can t put your way through college by working part time in the summer anymore the majority of colleges is free for single people who make less than 27k per year it s called the r pellgrant which pays per year for years with no repayment if you make more than that but less than 50k you should still get something
you gotta pull yourself up by the boot straps
they definitely know and a good amount of them likely own apartments where they charge ridiculous rental rates
we re talking about the people upholding the capitalist status quo always assume malice not ignorance
yeah they know what rent is because they charge it
the something that grandma would be finding is roommates to split an apartment or a carboard box to live in
well we are going to find out what the elderly who can t afford to stay in their house are going to do out of every people in the us is an elderly person in a little more than a decade it ll be out of every people hopefully whatever the govt decides to do will help everyone out here in california we are newly enforcing laws that will override the nimbys builders will be able to build wherever they want to as long as its safe i m not joking it s been pretty shocking the only thing holding back the builders now is that so many workers left construction it will take years for them to come back and build up their skills
the grocery store most likely would not hire her anyway they will think that she is too old slow frail etc
sounds like nyc has entered the chat
you just described most of the baby boomer generation
shitheads to the extreme can t wait until younger generations start to take over positions of power and these exploitative fuckers are out if we ever get there
a lot of states and cities do have higher minimum wages but other states and cities are in a race to the bottom to attract greedy employers they compete on offering zero to their citizens and tax breaks to the employers
boomers
i mean its not that bad of a claim also yeah the country is suppose to support
your misogyny is showing
what does that have to do with corporate greed and greed in general rather women burned bras are not the rent would still be too damn high housing and property taxes too damn high too
please elaborate thank you
i think my response to a boomer saying to get into a trade would just be did you
i spent the last years as an apprentice electrician i m probably leaving the trade because my mental health can t handle it i m currently making hr the only reason i m financially comfortable is because a friend let s me rent a room for of what an apartment costs a while back i got a minute ass chewing about how i in my 2nd year of as an apprentice wasn t doing the job of a foreman then in the next breath was told that i shouldn t be making material runs because let the people who get paid as a foreman spend their gas fuck that either i m a foreman and should be getting paid as such or i m not and shouldn t be abandoned and left on my own on a job figure it out
the pay blows when first starting out and you wear down your body so much faster yes there is good money in the trades but damn do you have to pay some dues in time and body to get there
you picked the wrong trade bud i know year olds making hr
that s the pay floor for where i work which is a warehouse
i would be garbage in a trade i have zero mechanical ability poor eyesight and i m a total klutz
i sympathise for me i was lucky enough to buy in i could not afford to buy this house from me today if i was not now i d be fucked
death seems like a more welcome escape suicide is my retirement plan
i m in the same exact boat and i couldn t agree any harder it s about the only peace of mind these days
if you have limitations do you think you might like wfh where i work we have full benefits etc if you want me to dm you
what skilled trade pays minimum wage
the other half own businesses and think oh not having slaves will affect my profit margin so it s way better to tell them they should work double the time for me to make double the money if they want to eat and sleep with a roof over their heads instead
this right here the squeeze is real anyone who thinks interest rates will help the recession more than taxing the rich is a fucking absolute contradiction of a capitalist the government picking winners isn t new they picked their generation to be the winners until death it s why they run it
the hilarious thing is we re just a tiny little tourist town of less than people more than four hours away from the nearest metropolitan area of any serious note and we have those kinds of prices
nyc might get you part of a closet dc might get you a room in a house of a retired person as a companion ie you do all of the chores and cooking for the privilege of paying less than the to get a bedroom with roommates
yet i m born and still a real woman
no it wouldn t the workforce would be way less demanding
oh sorry i am going out of town for the weekend x200b every weekend
unfortunately thanks to the system we live in this is kind of legit barfing is a big sign can t have you working if you re barfing gonna have to have a doctor s note to cover that if you take too long getting it they re basically unexscused absences sucks to have to but should ve gotten that nite from urgent care that would ve covered you for your missed days and would release you back to work
your former employer is disgusting
i would have but i had just payed my bills and couldn t afford to pay for urgent care visit
that s kind of weird unions work yet they were previously living out of their cars and using food banks to survive why did the union let things get so bad before
i ve asked some people who denegrate socialism what exactly they re talking about with the term broadly as far as i ve gotten they mostly use it as a term for policies they don t like when some of you blame capitalism for the worlds problems what is it specifically your talking about i assume you don t want to abolish capital money as a medium of exchange and switch to a barter based economy but i could be wrong
capitalism has brought more prosperity to the world than any other system
i m all for joining unions and op image doesn t mention social welfare policies which is also important but if you think capitalism is the source of your existential dread and feeling of doom that s a you problem not a capitalism problem
i ll almost certainly get banned for this but i absolutely love capitalism but it s not capitalism that makes me crazy is the government
we have the worst of both worlds with capitalism at the moment on one hand we have the corporations as people concept where they are allowed unlimited campaign donations and influence to strengthen their monopolies and meddle with regulations and oversight if they are people they re very wealthy and powerful sociopaths since their only goal is profit at the expense of all else on the other hand the government subsidizes them and picks and chooses winners and losers and sets up pay to play environments so not only are these powerful sociopathic entities allowed to change government and strengthen their positions and operate as people they also have dug themselves in so deeply they get bailouts when they fuck up so capitalism in this stage is overly influenced by extremely powerful sociopathic organizations that do not face consequences the rich get richer phenomena is a fundamental reality observed in many different domains not least of which literally with humans and power wealth capitalism works when we can foster innovation and put limits on when simple inertia and power begets power it becomes a feudalistic hellhole when it starts to actively reinforce power
when i talk about it i always like to point out that the usa is not a capitalist nation it is crony capitalism at best run by the multi billion dollar companies
for me capitalism per se is not responsible for the world s problems but when it becomes runaway almost fascist capitalism yes it absolutely is and by that i mean a focus on unsustainable growth share price to the exclusion of all other factors destruction of employee work life balance stagnated wages union busting political lobbying cronyism cartels monopolies and killing competition ridiculous executive compensation as a multiple of average employee wage disregard for and lobbying against regulations designed to protect the public and the environment and so much more
we ve only tried one system on a global scale but because some people got prosperous under it it must be the best system really that s the argument you wanna go for show me how well capitalism did against the global economic system of egalitarianism and equality for lifting people out of poverty and boosting prosperity to compare it against and then we can talk about how great capitalism has been
it s flawed and imperfect but so is every system ops title doesn t really match the link the link is about telling you a potential union you can join part of the labor market under capitalism is the employee demanding from employer this is much better if people are unionized and should be encouraged
capitalism has brought more prosperity to the world richest of the global population than any other system while driving almost into poverty ftfy
if i were to simplify your position it sounds like you re referring to the corporate corruption of the government against actual people am i on the right track
ok and how do you distinguish between the two if it s large corporations that are in charge i thought that was fascism
as annothher comment it sounds like a simple way to put it might be corporate corruption of the government does that sound right
we ve only tried one system on a global scale what exactly do you mean feudalism had a pretty good run long long before that socialism communism was dominant around the very sparsely populated world most places tried various forms of slavery for one time or another
go into a grocery store in a capitalist country go into a grocery store in a non capitalist country then tell which is better
cite your source for your numbers
slavery isn t at odds with capitalism slavery in the united states was absolutely capitalistic
i think the grocery store in star trek beats every grocery store you have ever been in
that s true for the us yes it depends on exactly what forms of slavery and capitalism we re talking about
ok an imaginary grocery store is better
