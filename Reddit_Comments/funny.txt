if people find the content funny it gets voted to the top isn t that how this subreddit works as a comic creator i take offense to you labeling our work as low effort and poorly made or saying our jokes are stolen you are directly hurting artists with these irresponsible biased labels this work takes a lot of time and energy and abuse and its provided at no charge you re free to downvote it and move on if it doesn t suit your tastes but you don t get to police what others enjoy and shame on you for doing just that clearly this sub isn t for humor it s for whatever the mods deem funny based on their own specific tastes you could at least mention r comics or r webcomics to help drive traffic there or redirect the users to that subreddit feels like that would solve a lot of things
finally we re free from anecdote
not to mention the authors who aren t so good lmao but seriously good change it was getting annoying
i hate rules
praise you
good comics are overwhelming this subreddit
good comics are overwhelming this subreddit
oh no it is sunday the reposts are going to have to contend with the comics for whole hours
the problem isn t limited to comics half the stuff on page is just super lazy cat pics or dick jokes maybe mods should do some quality control or idk how do we raise the bar here
ah the fun subreddit that has no fun allowed
boo
wow footnotes do not display well at all on mobile web lol
this isn t funny
you may only be funny on sundays and wednesdays until told otherwise
fantastic news i ve had to spend the last year blocking any and all comic accounts i m well past at this point so they didn t inundate my feed
this is just going to make it too confusing for everybody
seems to be completely the opposite the worthwhile content on this sub is comics original videos then there s a wasteland of shitty rehosted clips and forwards from grandma
thank god
going from no comic wednesdays to only 2x week seems like a rather serious jump for which i would ask a tiny bit more justification i o w dropping from wk to wk seems kind of harsh likewise i m surprised that footnote is necessary was it not the case previously that only comic creator could post their own work seems like a bit of an oversight if non authors could post for those authors who release material 3x wk or more what do we expect one post per day only 2x wk only their best work or two or posts all at once on the permitted day finally are you expecting explicitly or not that non comic posts will simply skip wednesdays and thursdays or perhaps i m just old and nave
i don t mind comics when they are funny the issue is that about of the comments are literally people just stating the obvious with zero attempt to be humorous and they still get upvoted
can t you just force comics to have a tag that is filterable for those who don t like comics
going forward they should also be funny
i support this as i come here not for the comics but mainly becuase of the genuine spontaneous humoristic content so it makes sense to me to appy that moderation
true
unless its calvin and hobbes
going forward is such an asshole thing only a boss would say i m outa here
that is a funny rule
the authors who aren t so good
so frag day and church
nice change i look forward to seeing how it pans out
how can we also avoid re posts as i can t look back in time
i have a funny story related to suicide years ago when i was in the 7th grade i had a fucking day i wrote a math test for that day i came home and my parents yelled at me harshly in addition to school i worked part time and was very tired then i felt fucked up and lonely even though i was a big wide kid i sat on the roof of our house and cried a lot at that moment i thought my heart would just burst it hurt a lot i sat on the roof for a long time but then when everyone was asleep i decided to suicide i thought nothing will stop me god himself wants me to do it i had already hung the rope on the very last step of the stairs made a loop and was about to leave for another world but it turns out my older brother was calming himself that night and did not sleep through the window he saw me hanging on the stairs without signs of life and how he screamed what the fuck are you doing go to bed you little fucker i heard it already from the other world and was very scared from which i woke up and changed my mind
everyone should get as many comics as you can find and post everyday
i came here on a bad day hoping to get a laugh i opened the first posts or so and i haven t seen a single post that made me laugh wtf is this sub
lp
i m fine with new comics on sundays gives you the whole week to perfect your craft
i hate rules
i feel like you re being too lenient with having two comics days but that s probably because i m in the comics bad camp
lets just go backwards then

comic artists get a verified flair will gif makers who submit oc get flair like this as well
that s the stupidest goddamn rule ever
deathmatch days pleeease
that s nice thanks guys

i think your husband is trying to send you subliminal messages
just how many dicks can you hold in your hand at one time
can you please ask where he got it i love it
cacdicks
at first i was like oh that s thoughtful what a pretty cup then i looked closer
that s why everyone laughs at mine
does he know
do you have a favorite
cocktus
plants suuuure
artwork by george o keeffe
new meaning to the term succulents
is he trying to foster new passions in you
fucculents
phallus chalice peter beaker plasdick cup skin flute gooner schooner thats all i got
wondering which keywords he used to find that
ballsy move
you can love your plants just don t love your plants
i can t believe they allow that at work
that s a penis
what a prick
if i had a cup like this they d take away dick shaped foods again
oh they re just trying to get a rise out of you maybe they have a bone to pick i don t know why they wood though it s just a bunch of poppy cock
as a kid i drew pictures of dicks
my what a long mug
nothing like some sweet amorphophallus titanum juice to wake you up in the morning
your coworkers are probably just green with envy over your awesome cup
his heart is in the right place mind is down the gutter tho
cute little cac dix plants
those look like tasty cockumbers growing some bang choy look at the size of the ball peppers hahaha penises etcetera
honestly it took me a minute to realize
my wife also loves plants
impressive cocktus
r theyknew
saying that design is a bunch of plant penises is technically not wrong scientifically i see several stamens including both anther and filament in those designs
man what a dick he is
oi did ya hubby have a link for this you can post i would love to get one
i m laughing because it s not a mug
i don t see the problem it s just a bunch of cocktuses
succulent dicks
looks like broccoli
he knew
he knew what he was getting lol
paige no
it is a cocktus
that s not even subtle just a bunch of green wangs all over that cup
umm i think he trying to tell you something lol
your colleagues have the same maturity level mine do i just haven t seen that mug at work
lol dickweeds
what a prick
i have a pun but i don t want to force it
better a gift from her husband than from her coworker
ah yes the mighty cocktus
guess he was a bit thorny when he went shopping
you sure it s cause you love plants
photosynthesis
where can i get this
that s a lot of dicks
plants
r theyknew
surely he knew
cocktus
he knew what he was doing
a cocktus is a noble plant
your husband got you that mug because he loves plants
you should post this to r succulents
guessing he gave it to you on the 1st
gives a new meaning to the term succulent
now to get the matching flower vaginas mug
as a manager of several levels of staff this made my heart race thinking about one of my staff having this at work and anticipating the call from hr before i do something to get you to put it away and take it home
r mildlypenis
i don t want to be that guy but if i brought the same thing but vaginas to work i d get fired
calling this a mug seems beyond stretching the definition of a word
nice cock cup bro
mark this n s f w op
r theyknew
i won t stand for the complete lack of uncircumcised penises i just won t
ok i need to know where to acquire this mug
your husband did not in fact get you that mug because you like plants
you must really love plants
is that paper covering it weird looking mug
i have a similar mug the mug https://i.imgur.com/fho1jrl.jpg)
prob a passive aggressive way to get you fired and be a stay at home mom
i do not think this is work safe equipment
can you ask him where hypothetically someone like me but no me can buy that for uhhhhh scientific purposes just hypothetically
i m prickle dick
r mildlypenis
r theyknew
i swear it seems that what ever is pictured people have to sexualize it i think that mug water bottle is really cute i hope the wife appreciates the thought that went into choosing it for her i also hope that she uses it when he is around
r mildlypenis
i can feel the discomfort already
ok did he seriously not see it
hopefully you work in a tall building because it i had to hear about your stupid mug while everyone laughs non stop i d jump off the roof
when you say colleagues it means you have an excellent job congrats

after using that lobster for ten years i would be also running away from it
she makes a beeline for that door you need to get someone standing out there in a lobster costume
ngl your wife looks for the whole years
it only took years but she s learning to fight back she probably needs more fire power than a dollar store squirt gun but it s a start look out op i think she s on to you
every year i see this video and i forget this is a thing and then i see the video again it s a vicious cycle that i enjoy
or as they call it in maine foreplay
is there something special about march
plot twist its the same lobster and he just wants to be accepted as part of the family
this is the video she uses at the divorce preceeding s
she seems to get younger
she evolved from an adrenaline fueled flight response and developed tools to fight and everything nature is amazing
version with sound https://youtu.be/x8d3yfmjcxw) note i always post on reddit without sound because the sound is all over the place first two years have no sound since they were actually photo burts a few other years have unpredictable sound levels from loud to muffled because i had a phone with a bad mic for a while so years and my son finally joined in on the scaring this year we were waiting for the kitchen to be all clear so we could get the lobster and surprise her and we finally saw our opportunity when she was outside setting the table the plan was for me to sneak around the corner from the front door and my son would jump out first from the side door closest to her and chase her with the toy lobster which would then run her into me well she saw me sneaking about and she started running for the door where my son was you ll hear in the video her first scream when she opened the door and had a toy lobster in her face and yes she thought it was real in the moment and i really wish i had that on camera all in all a failed execution that worked out in the end props to her for caching an emergency water gun this year
one of my favorite legacy comments on this guys posts is from u ok milk husband hahahah wife ewww lobster out out brief candle life s but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
officer on scene yeah we got a domestic battery with the use of a deadly finger snapping lobster over
i too choose this guy s dead crustacean
it appears from these videos that you have a great relationship congratulations love her smile and the joy the shenanigans clearly bring
this always makes me sad that i don t have a wife bestfriend to fuck around with
is your wife single asking for a friend
i envy this i want this type of relationship i m crying this is very wholesome
if chasing your wife over a period of years with a lobster isn t relationship goals i don t know what is unfortunately i can t afford lobster nor a wife
your wife ages like wine
pretty wife nice house adorable kid lots of lobster dinners yup op has it made
i guess chasing her with a lobster is better than chasing her with the crabs
and another year of reddit thirsting for your wife
i wonder if she starts feeling anxious near the end of march knowing that she ll have to face this exact scenario again
i can t believe i ve seen this updated every year for a decade always makes me laugh
how has it been years already
fear spatula cage pot lid she s getting better and soon she s going to wake you up with a mouth full of lobster and fluffy bunny speak in your ear now wha bisch
this is all i want in life not money not fame not even accomplishment just a family you have a very happy home
seems like it turns her on cause every third lobster chase she carrying a baby
imagine how terrible a year old dead lobster smells
i love the evolution of her reaction it only took five years for her to fight back that last one with the kid helping with the torture is premium bonding imo well done
this is what happiness looks like
we get it man your wife is hot quit bragging
it was less than minutes you liar
next year i suggest you up it chase her to the front door and have your son waiting with another lobster outside the door
also nice place you got there
man what is that three kids i m impressed and also depressed by how tidy that house is
man you ve had a house lobster and someone s baby for years you are lucky
i feel sorry for the lobster
the best part is when you boil them alive
you can chase me with a lobster times a day as long as i get to cook them that same day
and to another years of me never finding love cheers
it s family activity now
even though the economy prevented us from staying together i knew my last partner s love was genuine because he would troll the shit out of me with the same shit eating grin he had when he would tease the cat for fun
that is amazing it s true then what they say about marrying your best friend she is a keeper
i look forward to this every year hope you3 family continues to prosper for many years to come
good god has it been a year already
christmas decorations still up in april sort it out mate
it s become a family tradition the yearly lobster run
this is just adorable i want what you have mainly a wife and a lobster
poor lobsters
lucky for the world you thought to record it all so lucky
damn love is so cool
i look forward to these every year
that lobster already has been taken away from its habitat and now it has to be played with before being eaten
plot twist she s deathly allergic
years that lobster must be sick of that shit
man can t believe it s been another year always love this post glad your wife seems like a good sport
the secrets to a happy marriage
no lobsters were hurt making this film but dinner killed them
it s a good life
this is the dude that did that medal of honor meme
this is too damn cute man my favorite part is seeing your kids growing up smiling seems like they love their parents never lose that fun spirit
damn how old is that lobster by now
who needs sound
how old is this video i remember seeing this a few years ago
she decided to fight back
this is going to stand up well in court
good to see you raising the next generation of lobster terrorists
kind of gets me thinking i wish i had a hot wife i could chase around the house with a lobster
can t believe it s that time of the year again already
correction years of chasing our wife with a lobster this is reddit after all
u jontheboss i wait for your video every year can t wait for next year lots of love to you and your family xx
thank god you still can find wholesome out here in the wastelands of the internet thanks for sharing this was a delight
fun with the family before you torture the poor lobster and boil it to death wholesome stuff
all the lobsters that were harmed in the making of this movie
you do know that s a living animal
ten years of torturing lobsters
poor lobster reported
i remember initially thinking what kind of jerk chases their wife around with a lobster but that melted away the first time she flashes that beautiful smile she s clearly having fun and playing along and i look forward to the next decade of lobster day chases you guys are doing it right
that lobster is as old as the kid now they even play together
i may have something like this one day maybe you two are lucky
her slow mo run is hilarious
she s incredibly adept at grabbing something to protect herself which i guess makes sense considering how much practice she s had by this point
she learned to use tools halfway in
was my favorite so far
ten years i remember each and every one of these ahhhh the dayyyssd
each year there is more frames thanks for using your lobster as a way to document technology advancing
this is what the internet is for watching a complete stranger s kids grow up via videos of their mom being chased by a lobster
people are giving me negative likes but i meant that eating lobster in moderation is good for your everyone s health
man that is one old ass lobster
i didn t know a lobster could live for ten years
i m here for the list
it s cool how she progressively upgraded weapons and armor along the way
years later and the lobster hasn t aged a day
i love how the baby in couldn t be bothered x200b oh this is a thing how cute
years of lobster sacrifice ritual
i remember when years was posted

when i was four my family decided to move but i found them
i m about to go on my first child free vacation at the end of this month my kids are and almost it s time
wait i think i saw mike perform at borgata hilarious dude
loved the quick math
one of the funniest stories in the new testament was when the whole jesus family jesus mary and joseph accidentally left jesus behind when they were done visiting jerusalem for jesus s bar mitzvah it s like honey have you seen the son of god uh no i thought he was with you
i think you misheard she said in the car
good bit
rich arabs left baby with grandparents who have servants who do most of the work not unusual
can t believe he didn t make reference to the baby left in qatar airport it would have been a good line
that whole set just wrote itself you could tell the comedian enjoyed the exchange and was amused by the way things evolved he was probably thinking i couldn t have written this any better
lol i like this guy s energy on stage super likable
u mikerighthere great crowd work i m a stavvy fan if you know him great stuff man
qatari s vacationing in the us aren t seeing much of their kid at home either they probably have an entire staff taking care of them
jfc i m about to go on my first weekend away and my daughter is i can t fathom ten days away from a four month old
i can guarantee you that she cried over this that night now feeling extra guilty for leaving her baby
parents
i understand the comedy but the first half year with almost no sleep is actually awful any break is so welcome
rich people have nannies poor people have relatives
i m glad they didn t get into the whole wet nurse discussion
i m arab and i thought she left her baby in qetar train in arabic
they lasted months before needing a week and a half away from their kid i m betting a nanny will be the next expenditure
he looks like gabe from the office
i ve been enjoying a lot of improv comedians lately jessica kirson matt rife and matteo lane comes to mind very creative with their crowds
lol its funny but what many americans don t get is that grandparents are super close and sometimes live with these families so they are also raising the kids not as big deal to leave it with them but still months a bit early lol
i have seen my sister taking care of her twins day and night long i am still surprised that she haven t gone like ah shuck it who wants these babies
months roughly days so of the kid s life he was close lol
my parents went to california when i was months old and left me with my paternal not that it matters grandparents for those weeks the initial plan was to take me along but my grandmother said there s just no point i wouldn t remember it the travel time hours from uk would just be stressful so it was wrong for them me baby or other passengers to endure it and it would just limit the activities they could do on what would have been the most expensive and more expensive if they took me holiday they d ever had which is all true don t blame them one bit i don t doubt they did do love me but yeah after months take a break and enjoy yourselves they were only in their early s at the time
some cranky responses here ignoring that this is some great crowd work
i m noticing the 1st question was deftly avoided and the only info we got was that the child isn t home with the first person you d assume the father sus
chael sonnon s son is doing comedy
you better be at just for laughs this year mike
this immediately reminded me of this for some reason https://youtu.be/lp9eredus44
the people in the audience at comedy shows are another breed of species some of the stuff i ve seen in videos are absurd lmao
is this the guy from big time rush
this is honestly sad separating a child from its parents especially the mother at such a young age can cause serious emotional trauma
beast of a real comic
i m with ya i just have so many questions like you re new parents you ve been parents four months and you re just like nah let s pass him off to family and got to a whoooole other country one on the other side of the world for ten days like i get it but at the same time i m like nah man if i just brought a life into the world i don t think i m bailing for ten days when he s four months old maybe he s one of those babies that s four months going on four hundred years born wrinkled at a raisin and already shouting back in my day we had breast milk fresh from the tit none of this bottle fed crap i d leave that kid for ten days too
ha mike feeny
he was close it s about of the baby s life
feeney is that you u mikerighthere
child rearing advice from a standup comedian ha
his laugh is contagious good vibe also where are they like saudi if they are in saudi it d be normal to not be too surprised but he takes it like qatar is just an hour or so flight away if in american and they said qatar that d be bizarrely wild and the location would become a bit
anyone who has had a colicky baby cheers these parents haha it s nice to get a break here and there if you have grandparents willing to do it and or the money to do it i swear little man gets tired of us and needs a break on occasion
i went to a conference when my baby was about months old and couldn t make it half a day before driving home to take my husband and baby to the conference with me
i deeply support these parents this seems healthy as hell
yeah hard not to judge when my son was four months old my husband and i left our kid with my mom to see a movie i cried the whole time and then cried when i got home
bro the amounts of parents butt hurt and overly sensitive trying to justify this is hilarious
horrible parents
kids have humbled me parents gotta do what they gotta do to survive shaming them for it will just get you some awful karma
he really has a beautiful smile and laugh
trying to set up some good luck while i look for local tickets to this guy i d take anything in my state
mike feeney is hilarious
feeney love your comedy and the pod
boo
daddy left the baby too
typical badu parent have a kid leave them with a maid and thus a typical spoiled brat is raised
that title is the facepalm dad left the baby too you know
normalize breaks for new parents that shit is exhausting and relationships fall apart because it s so all consuming if you have the time and resources you should definitely get away for a break to do something for you you ve got loads of time ahead of you with that baby
who is the baby with literal slaves that s who the baby is with
i don t even like leaving my dogs with a sitter for the weekend
our respective parents begged us begged us to go take some couple time and leave our new baby with them for a week so we did nice little week in spain while the grandparents get to coo over the tiny baby i don t get what this comic is all in on but i can only imagine he hasn t spawned yet
that title sucks man and mom leave baby in qatar
my wife and i have only had child free night away together in years
left with the nanny who is underpaid most likely
will someone do the math
good job riffing off the crowd
this guys hilarious his standup never fails to make me crack up
i hate tiktok cropping stabilization so much
this dude obviously doesn t have kids
months in and they need a break shiit you got years to go although it is nice to drop the kids off with grandparents for a week but i don t think we would dream of days at that age at most it was hours so we could go catch a film in the cinema and have a nice meal the wife was breastfeeding to so she could not stay away too long it never felt right to take a long break until the first was
tell me you don t have kids without telling me you don t have kids
deleted
how many shoes did they force the baby to make to pay for the replacement diaper
he sucks
she cries everyday and needed the comedy to balance things out
no morals whatsoever
that s like of his life well that wasn t funny in the slightest shit my funny must be broken
terrible mom
so why and how and again why
ugh
i couldn t be away from my four month old a year old yes but not a infant or school aged child but that s just me
their kid will have a detachment syndrome young babies need their parent to develop properly
society is spiraling
crowd work is fucking lazy and lame
uhhhh wow good job managing to turn that into solid crowd work but like holy shit i wouldn t be able to stop just tearing into them like incomprehensible how shitty their parenting is kind of in awe at the level of scumbaggery
sounds like unwanted and forced pregnancy case in laws can be a bit assertive about a couple having kids quickly
jim carrey
when did harry maguire start doing stand up comedy
has he traveled back in time and talked to my parents
looks a bit like jim carrey
after the 10th kid my nana said ciao and headed off to italy for a day break this was month after my aunts birth i would rather a mother be happy and make time for herself children are fuckton of work
a family member offered to pay for a weeklong trip when our son is a little older and can stay with his grandparents my fianc was sitting there thanking them meanwhile i m just sitting there like without him
for once people going along and not throwing a fit
is op funnier than mike feeney
saw mike open for someone at mohegan sun the main act was genuinely pissed at how much funnier mike was lmao

i hope you facetime them every day
i m on my first vacay with my little guy and it s great my wife now wants to take one just the two of us and i m like i don t really want to be away from him for last long he s months never knew how soft being a dad would make me i love it

bring a bra to a stick fight everyone wins
i m appalled that the guys in the rear car weren t color coordinated they obviously lost that fashion battle
is that a mansier
i can support this
take note kids this is how a prank is done harmless entertaining and everyones laughing
funny how a man with a bra is nsfw but a man without one is not
i think it s funny that it s marked nsfw because nipples got covered up instead of revealed lol
damn everyone in this video was incredibly well supported
this video is banned in texas
when everyone is wearing a sports bra no one is
is there a video link with audio
lovely colombia
i thought you were supposed to stick a thumb in their butthole maybe that is just dogs

love it was definitely not expecting that i was waiting for one of them to take their shirt off though and realize they hadn t worn a bra that day and get embarassed
do these characters have a channel to watch this is damn hilarious
and best of all they all went home with a cup or two
when the first guy came out of the car with the bat i thought of tuco salamanca from breaking bad now i can t help it he s gotta be thinking this bra is tight tight tight

future plumber
it s all fun and games until he tells you to remove those paper bits with your bare hands
who else involuntarily flexed their cheeks
the reflex like when someone puts their finger into your ear
i literally don t understand how someone can have their asscheeks out and not feel it do they not feel the air on their butt do they just not care what is it
imagine being the kid sitting there and not knowing their pants are down and then realizing the jerks behind you have made a game out of embarrassing you
goooooooooooooaaaaallllllll
dental plan lisa needs braces
their ass looked hungry like it was waiting for the prey and then retreated into the depths like a damn zoobooks commercial

i used to play this game with my friends at high school basketball ball games never had that good of a reaction
i high school we threw bits of gravel down this girl s pants but apparently they didn t go into her underwear or asscrack they were just piling up in her pants and when she stood up and all the gravel fell out it sounded like a rainstick
hungry hungry hippo
high score bonus points
sorrryyy siirrr got the cookie in your bum bum

asinine but iluvs it
i threw a quarter in a girls butt crack during lunch in high school she clearly felt it but she was too embarrassed to do anything she was the girl who would sit by herself and my whole table was laughing i feel terrible as an adult looking back but i got knocked out once in a fight unrelatedly so i guess karma
i used to sprinkle saw dust in there when i would have to see that on the construction sites
hole in one
that s actually a video game forgetting if it s on pc or app store
me in high school boyes throwing erasers down my pants because my pants were always too big thanks for that repressed memory
this sound is stored in my subconscious but i can t think of what game it s from
i wanna see this reversed

i always thought it was kinda fucked up when alcohol companies use terms and sayings for a crippling diseases that ruins lives and causes so many deaths every year serenity pray has helped lots of people recover let s make fun of it and say we need wine hurhurhhr delirium tremens is a horrific part of alcohol withdrawal and is one of the only fatal parts of any addiction recovery let s name our high abv beer after it it just seems weird to me

if you d just laid all those eggs you d be tired too look at the size of them
when i first read this i thought it said euthanized instead of unenthused
that right there is an existential crisis in progress
that s not a schooner that s a sailboat
what do you want for easter little girl i want a pony best i can do is egg
appears suffocated in the suit
probably drunk
looks just like the one i saw in concord mills in nc this past weekend scenery setup bunny everything wonder if this is the one i saw or a company that uses literally all the same stuff setup and travels
i don t wanna be here anymore
don t film him when he s not on duty that dudes crotch smells like pee not his own and his ears are still ringing from weeeiiird requests from children that he just has to roll with not to mention that suit is easily swamp ass central i ve had to perform in one of those and that s probably the easiest way to lose weight and smell your worst for weeks straight you give him a say grab some panda express i ll hold down the fort and you will have literally just hired and assassin that guy will be so loyal
underneath that suit is a year old single man with 15k in credit card debt an apartment he can t afford and dreams of a life as a successful cartoonist with a wife and kids
i ve done that gig it s no easy for six hours of kids teens and weird adults taking pictures with you that suit was hot too
easter bunny has seen some shit
i was the easter bunny for a few seasons and the mall would be so slow i would just take naps in the suit lol pic for proof https://share.icloud.com/photos/03f6xa_rva3zf0o4krd6lhcyg)
met too eb me too
i can t believe i left my flask at home
there s too much fucking shit on me
i saw the easter bunny at a mall on st patrick s day i think of the multiple times we passed by only once was there an actual kid in there with them
i wore an easter bunny costume once for a business it s very hot inside and hard to see lol i had a blast though i was only or at the time
ketamine ll do that to you
he s probably hot as fuck in that costume and that fan in the bottom left corner isn t doing diddly for him
he s missing the masters
i feel the same way when playing animal crossing during bunny week
at least he looks cute rather than a horror show like some easter bunny outfits
male bunny dressed as female bunny and worried about the current war on drags best explanation for the defeated posture
appears euthanized
hello darkness my old friend
these look the same in every mall huh
i went to law school for this
the poor thing lmao
notice the fan dude is probably cooking
yeah he s in a mall who wouldn t be upset
this bunny is on grass
that edible at lunch hittin hard
well no wonder looks like you re shooting him from a snipers position
i had a flashback of both billy bob in bad santa and will ferrell in blades of fury i so want to see something like that irl
i am guessing he had a little too much carrot juice the night before
he s probably relaxing but resisting the urge to grab his phone out of a pocket that he cannot actually reach source wore a similar costume last weekend
or exhausted
i read that as euthanized
looks like he s got at least fan
pissed and tired
the one at our mall isn t hopping around either
having been an easter bunny before i can guarantee this bunny is taking a nap likely due to heat exhaustion
i saw the easter bunny at my local mall last spring while our animal shelter was promoting an adoption event and i legit felt bad for the person in the costume because no one showed up for three hours hopefully he she is getting paid a decent hourly rate to put up with the boredom while sweating their balls tits off
i read euthanized and tbh it still made sense
sean spicer should have known he was doomed to return to his old job
as a kid teen i used to feel bad if no one was hanging out with the easter bunny or santa now as an adult i just feel bad that they have to do it at all
you misspelled euthanized
i wore this exact same costume and had a nearly identical set up like years ago when i did it for a friend of my nana s and her company she worked for as i recall that costume is hot as heck and that box fan disguised as a table or something is definitely not enough especially with it being that far away he s probably exhausted from the heat
i read that as euthanized same thing i guess
i read that as euthanized
well duh do young families or anyone really even go to malls anymore
just needs a venti starbucks caramel ribbon crunch frappucino blended beverage with coconut milk an extra affogato shot cinnamon dolce syrup stevia in the raw and no whipped cream he pretty much looks like how i feel after typing that
is that like the world s most common easter bunny suit or am i like less than miles away from op
my dad retired anesthesiologist used to refer to himself as the ether bunny this time of year
but really am i hiding the eggs or hiding from myself i never wanted to do this for this long but how do you break from the eggshell that is yourself sigh i need a drink
you re not the real easter bunny yeah well that s not real dad either next
the posture might have something to do with that chair i would slump if i sat in that chair
looks euthanized
my ears feel heavy
they just look like they re sitting in a chair to me
vancouver mall
man i feel ya
the easter bunny looks like he needs some anti depressants
the bunny at the menlo park mall is more realistic
i have to do what tomorrow ah hell i m gettin hammered
hippitus hoppitus deus dominae
the easter bunny is always unamused
he s taking a hit
he s got too much shit on him and doesn t even want to be around no more
nope just drunk
just been beaten up by jay and silent bob the poor bastard
he s trying his hippity hoppity hardest gotdammit
he s sleeping
my brain automatically said euthanized my bad
the look of someone that has to boil and dye two million eggs by sunday
san diego
lol easter bunny all fent d up
somebody get the easter bunny some narcan
bro looks depressed contemplating suicide
that s the ether bunny
eff my life
probably took a couple oxy backstage before going onstage
san b
how much you wanna make a bet i can throw a football over them mountains yeah coach woulda put me in fourth quarter we would ve been state champions
the easter bummer
telling kids that rabbits leave eggs because god is stupid af to begin with
sad bunny
reminds me of this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sta%c5%84czyk_%28painting%29#/media/file:jan_matejko,_sta%c5%84czyk.jpg)
get him silent bob
silent hill
reminds me of zipper t bunny in animal crossing he s constantly bouncing from one foot to the other until you get a certain distance away then he basically takes the pose in this photo
the easter bunny at my mall was the say exact way but yellow
he s just resting his eyes
unless that s a teenager or a retiree they should be questioning their life choices that have led to this
drunk
ok bob now we just want you to sit there and entertain the kids oh and bob no cell phone the easter bunny does not use a cell phone so just sit there but
appears like an easter bunny at the mall from any angle dudes probably asleep lol

wait til he learns about n a
i see a bright future for him
worked about as hard as whomever photocopied that
no
future rocket surgeon right there
a whole mood
come on haven t you read the book no a beginners guide to self defense don t mess with this kid he no s
no
no
technically he s not wrong and i m all for it
gotta respect a man who can stand in front of his superiors and refuse
no
we ll take your word i guess
no
at least he is consistent
this shit isn t funny if it s real you better teach your kid to read
nobody wants to work anymore
on the upside he s excelling at malicious compliance
that s not funny that s passive agressive and rude i feel for this child s teacher
rorschach goes to kindergarten
he s gonna be incarcerated or in a shit industry ten bucks says this kid cures some disease or becomes extremely prominent like a ceo or philanthropist
future burger king fry cook
he s well on his way to a promising career in either the food service or lawn care industries congratulations
hopefully you don t encourage this sort of thing
oppositional defiance disorder
good luck he s going to be living in your basement or incarcerated as an adult and you will have no idea how he turned out this way he was such a good boy smdh
love him
he just wasn t having it today
if the kid put a period at the end i d have given him partial credit and then sat down and talked to him about his response figure out why he wrote no times and then let him know he needs to do better next time he d have probably screamed no in my face planet of the apes style but hey
i see he has read a book on no
we all had one moment like this tho right no just me and him okay
hire that man
i vibe with this lol
this kid is going places
one the greatest books i ve ever read
fuck you i won t do what ya tell me
look at that font i don t blame the poor kid
my son pulled something like this on one of his assignments this year i made him redo it he s got a bit of a rebellious attitude at times
sure it s funny but i hope someone is paying real attention i had numerous assignments look like this from about 4th grade onwards caused by depression and learning disabilities that no one noticed and i didn t understand
i did things like this too a i was bored and lacked challanges b lot s of things were uncomfortable or nonsensesical to my autistic adhd brain so i just refused to do things i think some of the worst things for me was learning french vocabulary my love for order and logic absolutely clashed with french orthography plus why should i learn french if there s absolutely no use for it in doing things i like doing there weren t even people arround me i had to talk to in french these days i wish had taken it more seriously but what can you do
as a teacher i like his thoroughness
it s idk where i m at
that s a whole extra letter
i love the poorly educated
no
do teachers still use ditto machines
he s technically not wrong
no
i d prefer not to
how is this compliance
yeah this has the same energy as people who post videos of their kid s tantrums to laugh about it with internet strangers it s a red flag that a kid this young is this mad about a school assignment
naw he s going to be living in their basement gaming the rest of his life
he did participate he wrote an answer for each question it just wasn t what was required a bit like when you re asked your sex on a form and you write yes please malicious compliance

i m it would make him drive into a concrete wall to erase the image from his mind
i ve obliged a few truckers but apparently most of them want to be flashed only by women
i hope he s ready for all the dick he s about to see
aight one flash bang with some fries comin up
he was not impressed by my butthole
its the spirit of the act that is important also if theres something unexpected i dont mean dick put a bird in your shirt and itll flutter out when u flash em
photoshop skills are worse than the pickup skills
he will either be happy or accosted
this has monkey s paw written all over it
flashbang out
the last finger on the monkey s paw curls as a crowd of men in trenchcoats emerge from around the next ten corners
hits hi beams
let me get my flashlight
years flashes bring back flashing make my life better
why put it on the back though how would they do it if after reading it
truckers in my state seem to be taking things into their own hands https://i.imgur.com/dsnhh73.png).
i would like to see a counter of how many people that genuinely worked on
got a man of the people says keep hope alive
commit a crime please please please
careful what you wish for unless they re bi and not picky
helpin out the trucker behind him he shoulda put that sign on the front if it were intended for him
nah we d definitely still look and give you the thumbs up might be a little ashamed jerking it later but hey wouldn t be my first this is weird wank
you ve never been to a truck stop before eh
keep up the good work never know
so much
are you the guy
i wish my photoshop skills could produce this i have no skills
might be his play either way

i saw a spider at the gym he said it was leg leg leg leg leg leg leg leg day
that s a cellar spider i m arachnophobic but i have an uneasy alliance with the cellar spiders in my house they eat house spiders even the hairy ones that are bigger than them they mostly chill the the corner of the room barely moving unless as this gif shows it s leg day so i leave the spindly bois alone and haven t seen any other kind of spider in my house for years
daddy strong legs
pretty sure they do this because they feel threatened spiders too probably
any spider expert why does he do that
whats the song
dude wipe that plastic shelf down with a soapy rag for christ s sake
yo what sthe name of the song
so is it doing squats or pull ups
what is this music i swear i ve heard it before
put on some music while gets ripped so he can kick you out of the house
what song is this haha
gotta work those legs
there s a spider spider spider he s deep in my soul soul he s lived here for years years he just won t let go he s laying around he s got a mean bite now he s ready to fight and stand up for what he knows i don t need your trophies or your gold i just wanna tell you all go fuck yourselves go fuck yourselves go fuck yourselves i really mean to tell you fuck you motherfuckers i don t need you in my bar
oh my god i want to be his friend so bad
it is prepared for food
i would like to see this with eye of the tiger playing instead
never skip leg leg leg leg leg leg leg leg day
since spiders are basically walking boners i m quite afraid to ask what those goals are
i m not here to fuck spiders but
bro please clean whatever he s attached to for ducks sake
so you wish to increase the strength of your anus
spider hiding in the corner super fuckin normal
you re weak dave get your shit together brah
always on those gains that fella will outlive all of the insects in your house
psh do you realize just how many pull ups i could do if i weighed less than an ounce like he does at least that spider ain t got shit on me
it s a sexual dance
ta tren tula
your hatchling calls me daddy this spider probably
do you even lift bro
any spider that has the confidence to come into my house and start flexing on me by doing push ups directly in my face is getting the house keys
homie doing kegels
those are spider man push ups
he just realized how tall you actually are and is preparing i would say always sleep with one eye open
dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dunnnnnn sings it s the eyes of the spiderrr
it s gonna be a strong spider
how is life working for you watching a spider workout
little guy is getting ready for mating season
in three months he ll be a tarantula
spider is becoming a personal trainer to help pat for rent
too hot no too cold no too hot no
this is what happens when the spiders get into your pre workout
swole der man
this is adorable the spider thought you wanted to eat it so it was trying to look big scary and too jumly for u lol
when he take your bitch
i have a spider living in my home office he works hard enough for the both of us heyooooo but i really do and man does he truck around in there
he s training are you one day soon hes going to throw you out of his house
here let me join
when he s done working out there will be hell to pay
i d play some music and start vibing with him
you my friend are a gem
it s alway leg day at spider gym
we should try plural like legs day hands day that way we have more inclusive language for spiders too
that doesn t make sense people don t say it s leg leg day so why would spiders make their legs their whole identity
i had one of these i d feed it ants and watch it go to town
this is opposite for me the cellar spiders in my house are the only ones that actively attack us like literally go out of their way to get to the humans and bite jumping spiders are our ally here though and the garden spiders they got our backs and we got theirs
i love them partially for how bad they are at being spiders on top of being generally very small and spindly they also create highly disorganized webs that contain no adhesive they trap prey simply by being a mess of threads roughly dense enough to tangle the unwary they also have a very silly threat display as shown in op s slow motion video they just go boing really fast and hope you feel bad and leave them alone lil goobers
i ve never seen any other kind of spider in my life apparently bigger and thicker ones common here
i can tolerate these types of spiders but god forbid i walk into a spiderweb nope i get shivers just thinking of it
nice
hello i m your friendly neighborhood spider enthusiast here with a quick explanation cellar spiders like the one in the video above do this silly vibration dance as a defense mechanism when they feel threatened by shaking themselves up and down at a rapid pace they can become a complete blur and even shake their entire web confusing predators with the rapid chaotic motions and also confusing them as to how big the spider actually is here s a better video displaying this mechanism at work https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iavfyeipzpi not sure why the spood is doing it so slowly in this video but they re just silly little guys so i m sure they re fine
i ve never seen one go that slowly the ones in my old place would go absolutely wild shaking around assumed it was a scare tactic
last time a video like this was posted the dance was explained as a defensive motion like the way a cat would arch or other animals might puff their fur to appear larger seems the dance confuses the spiders main predators
i m going with yes
i really need to know as well
eye of the spider iykyk
truly outrageous
fine he said it was leg leg leg leg day
i ve got two big black house spiders living on the window sill in my workshop i feed them flys the spiders are getting big they are like pets to me now
and that is how the legend of spider god ant demon was born
wow that s intense i m in the uk and our cellar spiders aren t known to bite and move really slowly in fact they re so polite that i imagine they d pay rent if they were strong enough to lift spare change
jumping spiders are the best they re legitimately cute and their intelligence is apparent when i find them i like to let down my finger slowly for them to inspect and hop on to then i bring them up and look in its eyes and it looks back never had one jump on my face lol but i consider that possibility
have you ever considered its you guys and not the spidey
hey spider what s your defence against predators cellar spider has seizure
haha the music is very fitting for whats going on thanks
this copyright free music is named guitar blast i added it in samsung gallery while editing
in the burning heart rising like a spider
truly truly truly outrageous
laughed hard ty
saw one eating a stinkbug in the corner the other day he stays
it s possible that cellar spider means different things in different places and you folks aren t talking about the same critter
yeah i worked at a warehouse that had literally thousands of these guys in every nook and cranny that wasn t regularly being disturbed never had them show any type of aggression you gotta be actively fucking with these guys to piss them off or wildly misinterpret their actions to be aggressive
ooookay hey new world tarantula what s your defense mechanism weaponized ass hairs
a gentleman and a scholar
absolutely appal leg leg leg leg leg leg leg leg

you ve gotta pay the cheese tax
i heard there might be cheese
cheese tax cheese tax
i have a question why is there an orange penis on your fridge
that s dedication
cheeselov s dog
cheese tax
that s a good dog
oh yeah and try opening a cooked chook bag without a cat climbing your leg
no song should have the song and then scratch to silence at the end
would an audio recording of the cheese drawer opening also summon your dog
a drawer dedicated to cheese yum
when i was in college i had a roommate who was then pre med now a surgeon who thought he was going to outsmart my dog he went in and opened the vegetable drawer and started crinkling one of the bags in it no response from the dog then he started opening the cheese drawer and within about seconds the dog was sitting by the fridge waiting
give him some cheese
every single time how can they distinguish it from the other sounds going on boggles the mind
better than a dog whistle
teach him she it to roll over in order to get a cheese prize it would make the video just that much better
mine do the same with deli so i recently switched to aldi deli and the wrappers are different a thicker plastic the animals havent connected the new sound to deli yet
cheese tax
had and dearly miss a golden retriever who was like that she could be in a dead to the world coma sleep in her kennel or on our bed lol and if i d open the fridge and ever so gently ease the cheese drawer open she d come bursting into the kitchen  la kramer in seinfeld how could i not share my cheese with her
every time you re cooking
and everyone know that you ve gotta pay the tax
yeahhh didn t realize they would stick out quite like that when i ordered them they re fun nothing says i m single more than a penis magnet
the better question is why is this the only question about the orange penis
it does have a song i can t get it to play on this subreddit i m too old for technology

bitch better not sell me a real watch when i m distracted
is this turkiye not uncommon to see genuine fake stores in tourist areas
real fake doors
none of them tell time not this one not this one
well shit i wanted a fake genuine watch guess i have to keep looking
sounds like a scam they re probably just cheap knockoffs of expensive knockoffs
fake watches made in china
next time i see a store like that i ll ask them if their watches tell time and if they do i ll complain that they re not fake

years ago my dad got a fake rolex for the hell of it he took it to a jeweler to adjust the band and the jeweler immediately informed him it wasn t real my dad told him he knew the jeweler ssid he d never actually seen a fake rolex and asked my dad if he could take off the back plate and look at the mechanism after he opened it up he asked my dad how much he paid for the watch and was shocked by the amount he told my dad thatthe quality of the watch was worth a lot more than he paid
til there s a watch brand named fa ke
reminds me of the sign in clerks at the counter if you plan on stealing please let us know
he s not really watching you he s fake watching you
can i pay him with genuine fake cash
genuine faux pearls
not a flamethrower i don t like elon but that was funny af
one time when i was a kid my dad took me to a shopping plaza in guadalajara there was a kiosk selling fake watches and i knew they were fake but i still wanted one for usd i had a rolex presidential that worked perfectly as long as you didn t put it under water or pay too much attention to the second hand
i used to go to korea that advertised authentic replicas
don t wear it outside if it s raining
i bought a fake movado from a dudes trench coat in nyc in the s watch lasted a good years miss it dearly genuine fakes can be pretty decent
the shopkeeper is sinfully honest
weird flex but ok
real fake doors
when my mom went to nyc i asked her to buy me a watch but only if it was an obvious fake rollllex etc with bonus points if the person selling it had six on each arm
i jumped over a fence this one time and a guy yelled out asking if i just jumped the fence so if course i said no then he asked if i was lying and i said yes he said at least you re honest that dude was awesome
for bucks you can get a fake rolex that is next to impossible to detect as a fake like a jeweler would need a loop and to know what to look for to figure it out
worked for barnum
dude that s what happened to me i reported them to the bbb

art reminds me of the captain underpants books
do you know how much power i d give up to be president why would i do that when i can moderate twitter like my own personal discord server
i always thought lex luthor s real world equivalent would be jeff bezos they have the same haircut and everything
i think you ll find our politicians weaponized incompetence long ago
the funniest part about this is how terminally online people can t stop using it they ll complain and whinge about how twitter is ruined but they won t stop like alcoholics or drug addicts the problem isn t their fault it s everyone else s
never used twitter don t care if it dies the internet has just made it easier to be horrible to each other and sadly there s no going back
legion of doom now charging for blue checkmarks source http://www.sheldoncomics.com/archive/230405.html](http://www.sheldoncomics.com/archive/230405.html)
with that kinda loss he ll never pay taxes again
batman i bought twitter
you can t stop a genius tech billionaire like me lex no but he can superman pulling a competent genius tech billionaire aka batman onto the panel
no way twitter is worth 20b it was never worth either doubt he could sell it for 5b might get a or or 2b offer
lex loser
lex dufus
sounds like he s doing the world a favour
zing got im
i am just imagining dorsey reading this while laying in a pile of cash in his jony cash underwear
ok but this is literally the exact type of shit that he d do it would have to somehow hurt or discredit superman but he would do this lex luthor is not a good villain because he can make these evil machines and deathtraps and kryptonite lasers and what have you he s a good villain because he pays for other people to do that and superman can t do anything to stop him short of killing him which he ll never do because there s nothing to tie him to it legally
visit r teslamotors comments for a trip into a dimension where everyone sucks elon s dong
oh no the blue check mark people are here to cry
never not funny
twitter was a failed from start political driven operation not a financial or technology operation musk didn t get that the other right wing social networks just didn t work and tried to take over twitter but most people still won t change sides or just use it for different goals he still believes is a lot of people been silenced thing instead of a lot of people don t share your ideas thing and now he is desperate doing weird things trying to recover financially or harassing users
should ve invested in real estate
flex luthor
too bad the incompetence was weaponized long before any billionaire bought it the meme proves that by saying that the owner of twitter is responsible for each user s personal actions like they don t have autonomy over their own fingers and brains lmao if you use that app in general for anything besides making money you are incompetent didn t take a billionaire to make that happen it took you being a sheep to social media and the group polarization it provides
weaponized incompetence that s a little too real for me
not a musk fan or anything but you can easily check twitter s market cap it s not 44b as when musk bought it but it has increased some from last year apparently i do not know how to internet today search it and that what i saw and didn t look close enough to see that the company was delisted let this be a lesson to me
i feel like at least of free world s population could have made twitter better after buying it just get rid of shadow banning apply rules policies fairly instead only on right wing people get the crazy far left people too charge companies and only them to buy a new color for their checkmark otherwise it s blue by default but companies can pay for the color that matches what type of company they are like gold for food places purple for banks or some shit i dunno make a premium service that lets people upload longer and or high quality videos show up in recommended lists more often or something that isn t absurd twitter was shit before he bought it there were literally so many secret and hidden bullshit reasons for getting shadow banned and the idiots running it were literally selling blue check marks to even bigger idiots
oh no an evil plan that hurts literally no one
and i have partnered with other billionaires to control the narrative by removing limits on damaging content to the public at large no amount of x ray vision super human strength can deal with this shit they ll just boost fake post about how superman an enemy or something
there s less luthor but still
i don t think he worries much about it
unfortunately we ll never really know the nature of the incompetence the muskrat has had a ton of paid campaigns destroying his public image and he s done nothing at all to improve it himself like there are plenty of worse people who are much more loved by the public as soon as twitter came under his authority everybody involved started sabotaging everything they could
to be fair musk paid way too much for twitter when most of its value was overinflated with bots twitter was shit to begin with and he only made it worse which hey gotta give him a gold star for managing to make that cesspit even worse
instead of saying it s not rocket science we should say it s not running a social media company since that s demonstrably more difficult
more like elon luthor
watch a billionaire buy twitter reddit facebook instagram tumblr and youtube to make illegal for peple to talk shit about him
the secret envy is strong with this one
deleted
if you think musk bought twitter to make money in the short term you are delusional besides money takes you to a certain level to go further you need power
twitter wasn t even good to begin with and since everyone from twitter is migrating to reddit reddit isn t good now
elon musk once again following in the shadow of someone with somehow even greater weaponized incompetence the only difference is trump was allowed to claim the 900m in business losses on his personal tax returns https://www.npr.org/2016/10/04/496596466/how-donald-trump-lost-916-million](https://www.npr.org/2016/10/04/496596466/how-donald-trump-lost-916-million)
people really seem to care what others do with their money i mean this guy bought something that was openly purchasable and then lit it on fire it was his money and his company to burn to the ground who cares this isn t the first time it s happened it won t be the last everything will be ok and life will go on with no lasting affect positive or negative
better to be worth nothing than what it was
this is a very strange comic
this isn t funny at all its dumb
this is the kind of hilarious bullshit only propaganda peddlers could say and only shut in idiots would ever buy twitter was sold for billion despite not really being worth anywhere near that and is now offering stock options based on a billion dollar evaluation which doesn t mean if stocks were sold today to the public it would be on that same evaluation it was not worth billion then and is not worth billion now this is something anyone with any knowledge of the company stock trading or economics will understand not even expertise in just basic base level understanding definitions and loose connections level understanding is all it takes to see the bullshit anything to make elon into a supervillain twitter was a floundering left wing propaganda hub with little in the way of redeeming value now it s just a social media hub with little in the way of redeeming value it s better frankly to not have twatty narcissistic liberals with their finger on the button ready to suppress the twatty idiotic conservatives selling their conspiracy theories and alienation with modern society but it s not like that means it s good suddenly it s still the shower thoughts only form of social media
not to mention sparking the wave of tech layoffs that will crash the economy which is what he wants because in a down market he can swipe up more cap share from the middle class
doesn t matter still much better than old twitter
this is bullshit twitter was a cesspool
bad art not funny go back your to your job at mcdonalds
such high effort to fall flat
heh
luther risked the value of his other companies to purchase one that he couldn t really afford to sooth his battered ego and now he s driving it at high speeds into the ground can superman stop the impending impact maybe will he nope
wait is this supposed to be elon musk
cough elon musk cough cough
fuck elon reckless motherfucker
tra la laaa
was just thinking that glad those books are still alive in someone else s memory
same
very dave pilkey style
i was going to say the same thing lol
those pages which you could flip fast for a little laugh were almost always missing at school loved the books
to the people downvoting this its a quote from lex luthor from the justice league tv series
to be fair thankfully elon can t become president because he s a naturalized citizen
yeah musk is more like justin hammer imo
it s more that their incompetence has been weaponized against us
shortly after the invention of organized politics
some of us never started i refused to create a twitter account from the beginning and there s no way in hell i m making one now
there s also people who use twitter for work
i m telling ya this truly is an act of philanthropy from musk he s willing to sacrifice his own fortune to remove twitter from our lives thank you daddy musk
why though because i m batman
and yet people _still_ call it the most important communication platform in the world make of that what you want
remember when facebook bought instagram for 1b and everyone was like what wow
i d as soon stick my dick in the blender dimension r m thanks tho
twitter was a failed from start political driven operation not a financial or technology operation do you have anything to back that up well researched analysis or professional credentials or anything like so many comments on here it sounds like an opinion masquerading as evidence based intellectual insight so im trying to work out which one it is
citation needed
hard disagree musky boy saw how easy republicans were to scam and pivoted to cater to their idiocy he might be losing money off twitter to look like he s owning the libs but he s making it back other ways don t you worry
you might think you re anti elon but you re stroking him off just as much as his fanboys it failed because he s an idiot with a lot of money and it s very clear to see
twitter is a private company a company cannot have a market cap if it is not being traded on the stock market so i m not sure what it is you re looking at but it s not the market cap furthermore as a private company the only financial information available is that which elon makes available so i wouldn t consider any valuation of twitter to be accurate after it went private for all you know the company valuation has be dropping all year which considering the number of advertisers that dropped twitter over the year it is highly unlikely that twitter s valuation has done anything other than decline
how do you check a market cap of a private company whatever you re seeing online is based on the last value of the stock before musk had it delisted after buying it and taking the company private https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/26/technology/elon-musk-twitter-value.html
just wondering where you re finding twitter s current market cap after musk purchased it he took twitter private private companies do not have to report their finances publicly though insider information has shown twitter to be valued at billion as of march https://observer.com/2023/03/elon-musk-twitter-valuation/).
i realize that hating on twitter is the new foot fetish but it does hurt people for mainstream social media platforms to be taken over by deranged fascists
except the millions people that could have been helped with the money thrown away to buy twitter in the first place
to be fair musk paid way too much for twitter when most of its value was overinflated with bots that s like paying for a big mac and claiming that it was overvalued because it was being advertised as fine dining no it was overvalued because elon was an idiot who didn t do basic research that everyone already knew the reason the shareholders agreed to the deal is because they knew the company wasn t worth that much and a sane person would have questioned why they would be so willing to sell after previously saying the opposite the bot problem on twitter never lead to an overvaluation because the main problem with bots is spam which everyone has already knew and already factored into the valuation
turning neighbors into foes
they try so hard don t they
funny because studies have shown that it was right wing propaganda
probably says a lot more about you than it does about twitter
if it would hurt superman in someway luthor would totally do that like petty mother fucker he is
kids are still super into it
very much read that and dog man to my little one
i think people are just dying at shear horror of the idea that someone might be foreshadowing elon musk running for president if the last administration really happened anything can happen
this is how i see it he had to have done it for the joke buy twitter uncensored it and watched
only because everyone was on there at one point now everyone is either dropping it or moving to new platforms
if they meant elon s purchase of twitter was rhen the rest of the comment makes a lot more sense but out of context that first sentence just sounds patently false
that statement is definitely false but what i don t understand is why has twitter been given that stand in the social media space when it s one of the worst ones around twitter is now the official social media goverments use it corporations use it and it s the worst platform for that why wasn t a more open ended social media where people get to actually share their opinions adopted i m not saying any social media is perfect but take reddit atleast you can t fool or buy the algorithm here and there s a great downvote button to have a very solid stat based reaction to a statement
not need credentials or analysis for this it s an explicit actions thing
i remember back in i was driving to work and was listening to the plight of a journalist arrested in egypt the only reason anyone knew he was arrested was because he got a tweet out to his twenty some odd followers and because of that he was eventually freed i kinda knew after that twitter was going to he a big thing but i was off by a factor of like a 000x
i don t use twitter so i didn t know that he had it delisted how was that a benefit to him

chewed a bone
countdown to pornographic references
its all fine until hopper farts
you have to establish dominance
i refreshed my home page and this was the first post while reading the title my cat jumped on the chair next to me in the same exact pose
my two boy dogs also fuck eachother in the mouth
i ve seen this behavior it s usually seen amongst teens in fps i believe it s called teabagging it s a way to show dominance
i feel like some clarification is needed here
what type of dog is hopper
it would funny if in the dog world it is a thoughtful idea to place your pucker box on another dog for protection
i guess dogs have ass hats too
sorry to be the bone shrinker here but hopper was probably trying to choke murphy to get the damn bone
thanks your clarification lowers the suggested audience rating from r to pg
chewed a boner
if you knew my dogs you d know that only make murphy happy both of these dumb beautiful dogs have a rabbit turd addiction and they ll literally graze the backyard for droppings
i am familiar though i feel the lack of apposable thumbs results in inaccurate sniping for murphy in particular
he s a mix we think terrier and yellow lab mainly
it was an honest typo that i only noticed after the first comment thankfully i was able to clarify
lol yea he caught him camping those doggies are adorable by the way
that look of absolute defeat at the end he s definitely thinking it s him vs the world right then
i m not crazy i know it isn t magic or fate or whatever it s just really weird coincidence this has happened a few times over the course of my adult life and i always think it s the weirdest thing when it does for example at work a few years back i was chatting with a coworker about a particular customer we hadn t seen in some time they showed up in the store about an hour later another time earlier this summer i was thinking about what a shame it was that i hadn t seen any monarch butterflies around lately a few minutes later one goes floating by last night was probably the best example of this my boyfriend got home very late from work starving after barely eating during a hour shift he asked if we could go get food i say yes and we watch south park while he decides what he wants i made a passing comment based on the episode that randoms don t just offer you drugs out on the street as often as i had been led to believe they would as a child he decided what he wanted we leave i m driving he ran into the diner while i stayed in the car it was around 3am i m in a dark parking lot in my pajamas with my phone and wallet shoved under my butt locked in my car in a not super great part of town someone comes up to my window and motions for me to roll it down pointing to the blunt in their mouth and making a lighter motion i happen to have a lighter crack the window just a couple inches to give it to him then pray he ll leave when he gives me lighter back instead he chats for a while and passes me the blunt we had literally just run out and i thought fuck it took a few hits my boyfriend did the same when he came out i nudged him afterwards and reminded him of what i had said early i had poofed a weed bearing stranger into our lives in the middle of a sunday night
since we re reposting this and some people still don t get it this is not a swing it s not meant to be used in this manner and that s both why it broke and why the man is filming
so did they mess with the swing and that s why they are filming at a random playground the amount of times hope it doesn t break or something to that regard that was said leads me to believe they may have known
misuse of equipment often leads to breaking and no thats not a swing
why was someone filming kids in a playground
that was a lucky break it went forwards so he landed with his back safely on the grass and it didnt break that early
i came in like a wrecking baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
he made it perfectly
oh the moment i saw the swing fall it turned out that it was also very dangerous i hope he is not injured
i ll never understand people that laugh at someones accidents
it s more like he tampered with it and waited for a kid to come use it so he can watch it break
nah he collect those videos after rigging the swing he doesn t feel bad at all
does anyone else feel like the dude filming sabotaged it or is it just me
who is the weirdo creep filming kids in a playground from his car wtf
when depression hits you hard in the playground
alright death from final destination is just getting lazy at this point
my man enjoyed his life too much so the god decided to put it in his limit
he even managed to knock off the person who was shooting this video
this man has powers he doesn t even know about we need to find him and stop him before he speaks another thing into existence i d hate if the world ended right now down comes the pale horse lol
he had his best and worst moment of his life right there
that story could have ended way worse
not saying this isn t a great story but also uhh i probably wouldn t advise smoking a joint from someone you don t know especially when you say it s a bad part of town that was incredibly stupid of you glad you re okay and it is your life sooo you can do whatcha want but geeeeeez and obviously please know i m not trying to question your intellect or anything cause world knows i ve done quite a few stupid things and i guarantee i ll probably do more stupid things so just idk friendly worry and hope that you stay safe
as someone who was hanging out with friends and witnessed a dude passing a blunt around and then almost hit it until i saw another dude across the circle telling me no don t do this dude was new to the friend group and had smashed up pills and put them in the blunt and no one knew until it was too late i m still glad to this day that my friend let me know don t smoke anything rolled up from strangers
baader meinhof phenomenon https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/frequency_illusion
similar situation with the weed i was out with friends in a park and a girl was like shucks i haven t smoked in quite some time and i really want some right now like minutes later we randomly see the the biggest alcoholic and drug taker in the neighborhood we all know him and he s a really chill guy we chat a bit with him then he takes us further into the park and takes out a hidden stash of weed from a gazebo and we smoke it
you hit blunts off strangers even assuming it s weed and not anything else you don t worry about covid or anything else from putting your lips on it
what s the purpose of it then
and there is probably is big sign at the edge of the park saying the equipment is for kids and under and 100lbs or less
they knew it was going to break because that is not a swing they re meant to be walked across like the other kid is trying to do it s a balancing type of thing
fr why else is this mf filming some kid while sitting in his truck he he he peels out
because that s not a swing and it s not designed for that kind of abuse
no kidding i fell off a swing once was trying to get off it quickly and timed it wrong so i got flung into the air and landed more or less on my tailbone my back was super stiff and in extreme pain for a month and years later when i finally went to a chiropractor it felt like i had a brand new body for a while
probably just got the wind knocked out of him
he s laughing because it s a kid misusing playground equipment you re supposed to walk on that and it s supposed to be unsteady
when it s from someone doing something where they re fine and they were aware of what they were doing i get it i remember the last time i watched america s funniest home videos years ago the only part that i really found funny was a section where they had videos of teens doing stupid stunts in cases like this though i completely agree with you i honestly find this slightly horrifying though it does thankfully look like the kid was probably ok
it s not a swing
and then driving afterwards i know they probably went majorly impaired but that is still illegal and stupid to do
i d be pissed if i got handed a blunt or joint and it was laced with anything else that is not proper pot head edict hard drug users don t generally share drugs unless they trying to rob or kill you
why the fuck didn t yall beat his ass
lol covid should be the least concerning thing that could have happened from smoking a blunt from a stranger the world is moving on you should too
it s meant to be walked across it encourages kids to build balance or coordination or somesuch it s meant to be chained to the ground to prevent it from swinging past its limits like in the video if you watch the kid on the other one you can see it being used properly you ll also notice that he steps off a ledge nearby that s meant as the starting point and is far too close to be safe for a swing
at the parks near me the bottom is chained to the ground for this reason they weren t designed for what we see in the video
oh so they re out here breaking public property on purpose very cool and chill
interesting looks like a tire swing odd they would make something your supposed to walk across have so much movement capability seems dangerous
it isn t a swing the kid is misusing it
well for one i m a woman who has never been in a fight and i m not about to change that and certainly not to beat on no man i also don t know what they did to him cause i felt hella uncomfortable left immediately after and never followed up it happened like three years ago and one of those things i had forgotten until the memory was unlocked
it still exists whether you downplay it or not i never said it was the biggest concern but it s still a concern
this is dumb to downvote you can get herpes and or have it laced with another drug i mean i ve done it and i ve been the one to offer it but to each their own but i m with you i m way more concerned about other drugs or weird shit than germs
like the other commenter said there s usually a chain or something running from the pole to the ground that has enough slack that they ll still sway around a bit being loose like this is definitely unsafe for younger kids
swings naturally restrict the amount of height you can generate by using chains or ropes as the swing goes high enough the chain or rope goes slack and it becomes difficult to go higher without something external to generate force such as a rocket with a pole instead of a chain you can keep generating force and building up momentum and go higher and higher until you hit the limit of range of motion of the pivot the pole is attached to when that happens the force on the pivot increases and it will likely fail that s why most swings are relatively safe and swinging on something with a pole instead of a chain is not i don t think that thing is meant to be a swing
i didn t day it didn t exist i said time to move on the fact that was the first thing you mentioned as being concerned about says it all it s not the boogeyman it once was and positivity rates are around the same as influenza it s under control vaccinations exist and are plentiful there s many other things in life you should be concerned about more than covid
great explanation now that i m looking at it more i see what you mean
i m concerned about any contagious disease that can kill my immunocompromised family members

one day that dog s gonna grow up and he s gonna learn that these robots have food inside and then that robot won t stand a chance or maybe i m thinking of a bear
por little doggo he got traumatized for life
this is a lawsuit that thing nearly ran your dog over and its driving on the sidewalk xd
i agree with this dog
what language are you speaking
starships purdue
clearly you kick it over for scaring your dog
always trust your dogs instincts
we do have an occasional bear wonder near the city limits so it s not far from the realm of possibilities
he used to be afraid of snowmen these robots are everywhere in estonia and as i wish her a long and healthy life she has to get used to them just like she had to overcome her fesr of snowmen statues rocks that s bigger then her etc
they re very cautious they re on our campus and they wait forever at crosswalks until are no cars or people directly around the move very slowly too
what are the robots for delivery
i am afraid of snowmen as well can you teach me to conquer it sensei
i was just kidding lol but these are really cool r they for food delivery
they re prototypes but yeah been around for like years now i ve heard some us universities use them as well heard they suck tho haha but atleast in estonia i ve never heard of any vandalism against these robots as ive heard from the us
you must watch frosty the snowman on a loop with your eyes taped open until the fear goes away
we have them on our campus in south dakota no reports of vandalism to them here they charge a lot to use them though there s a special college meal plan that includes them for an extra cost

and here i thought baby gates were just what bill gates called his balls
his jokes about getting consensually dwarf tossed into a helo his black belt wife impersonating wee man and the soccer flag in canada are all or in his case
if a woman goes on a date with a midget and brings him home lifting him over a baby gate isn t going to stop her from fucking him
i d bust the baby gate down and say oh yeah
i think uppies woulda been better
you know the defining feature of baby gates as opposed to baby fences is that they open it is an intelligence and manual dexterity test not a height test
saw him live on a whim in austin before the covid times brad is soooo good if you want your face properly melted off go see him live
he is not laughing cause his jokes go over his head
hi john stamos story is hilarious https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x57wi38sdxy
isn t this the guy that admitted to raping a woman while on tour
you say mommy as you lift up both arms some girls might be into that
mini rob mcelhenney
average 5ft11 man
ah yes the guy who yells all his jokes
uppies please
one trick ponies aren t funny just like the face tattoo guy same thing also this perticular dude is a total fucking dick
laughing for real thanks
oh god the boost really got me edit it wouldn t be the internet if there wasn t a dark side to it ofcourse sad to read he s a rapist really takes away the fun what a dick
this guy admitted to raping a girl
i mean don t baby gates have latches on them to open close them
brad williams is so good even when his jokes aren t about his height he delivers them so well his shows have me in tears the entire time
quick question did he actually rape a girl or was it false
funny but dumb your an adult you can work the latch
apparently yelling is considered as comedy now
midgets are great they re fun sized
yo this guy is funny as hell whats his name
good bit awful person edit i highly encourage anybody reading this to look through this comment thread and gawk at these rape apologist losers
brad is a riot
that s screamingly funny
angry funny
is this the comedian who admitted to sexual assault on a podcast live stream can t remember
casual racism is okay if you re mildly funny i guess
dude i love brad i used to work with his sister and she got me and some of her coworkers a private show with him like piss your pants funny
fuck this guy my ribs haven t hurt this bad since i crashed my motorcycle
this the dude who backpedaled an accidental admission of rape
as a mexican i approve of this video and approve what he says
dude admitted to raping a girl
that s hilarious
that is hilarious
this guy is a little rapey
uppies
that s why some gates have doors
this is the comedian who raped someone and walked it back right
brad williams is a funny dude
did you accidentally crop out the funny part
so i guess being little gives people a pass to be blatantly racist smh
this guy is a creep once claimed to have raped a woman and then backpedaled when he got called out on it
up want up
i m going to see him live this weekend and i m so excited
why am i seeing this guy on every video social media i just don t find him funny bring me the cat videos
yea dudes funny i remember that time he told people about the time he raped a woman good times fuck this twat
lmfao i love when minorities can be funny and not sensitive those are rlly the best jokes
that last part cracked me up
he s hilarious definitely watch his special if your haven t seen em
yawn
this dude raped a chick once
kinda like fat comedians whose whole act is about their weight
itt people claiming with extreme confidence that they know whether or not he raped that girl it s anybody s guess at this point i don t get why people are acting like it s a settled matter one way or the other
not funny at all comedy sucks today
i fucking love brad williams he s so funny
this man is a rapist
he meant to say uppy uppy pwease
is that wee man
the rob mcelhenney of midgets
ive seen this hole show on pv but it was funny and this vid wasca nice callback
dude ain t funny
this dude is a rapist
i m denounce the racism in this video and his use of the m word
man i m so happy to see the success brad has had played baseball with him way back when growing up great guy
he ended the holding himself like a baby bit too soon should have sat him down gotten down on her knees on top of him
racism transcends everything i guess
he prefers his woman in the dark
didn t this guy admit to raping some woman on some random youtube video
fuckin legend
this isn t funny if you re an adult and don t know how to open a baby gate you don t deserve pussy this guy wouldn t have an act if he wasn t a little person if you like him good for you but nobody in comedy takes him seriously
i can t unsee this guy as a smaller version of mac from iasip
i m sorry but to a toddler that gate is just another achievable obstacle
simple let s do it on the couch
there s this way to get over a fence where you lean over it and hang on and you kinda do a flip over it you could do that
yeah i hate the tatse too
where s the proper video kink
what s the guy
i thought it was about the babygate scandal babies broke into a government building and tried covering it up
idk why but at the start i legit though he meant a young bill gates i either need more caffeine or a lot less
hmm i wonder what his nickname for the kids on epstein s island was
do you call your balls baby your last name why would you think that
you mean in his case
i caught his show live he has a bit about the dangers of getting into a crib with his crying kid so mom can sleep he was upset that he could still lay out straight he went a different way with the joke but i was imagining him having to summon the wife in the morning because he got stuck or training his kid to be a stool
where can i find this
do you happen to have a link
i bet plenty of those women would be very into to that
you know how much a baby gate can cost you you might as well end the date right there because she is gonna be passed especially if she bought the baby gate herself as opposed to a friend buying it as a gift for them
that s a hilarious punch line to the joke
that wouldn t have been a funny story though unless he struggled with the latch till she said nevermind
mine opens if you have leverage from above at gate height it s significantly harder it s not one of those ones that stay in place and you can swing it open like a door unfortunately
a lot of people just refer to them all as baby gates even if that s not technically correct
you know of comedians stories aren t true right maybe a seed of a joke because maybe his date really did have a gate which just made him think i can write a joke on this add copious exaggeration and hyperbole extensive work on the joke for months or years at free shows to figure out what the funniest way to deliver is then he records the performance he didn t go to open mic night after a one night stand where he proved himself to be totally incompetent then go bitch about it
it s funny most newer ones actually have a damned gate built into them most of us old fucks are used to the ones that just slide to width and have a ratcheted latch on one side and if you were on the other side from that latch you d have to reach over and halfway down to get to it which would be difficult for someone who is already unable to just step over it edit like this piece of garbage https://www.farmandfleet.com/products/478346-north-states-diamond-mesh-gate.html?blaintm_source=bing&blaintm_medium=pla&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=pet%20supplies%20and%20wildlife%20|%20low%20|%20shopping%20|%20shipto&utm_term=4583589121273290&utm_content=pet%20supplies%20and%20wildlife%3edogs%3eall%20other)
while most baby gates have an actual gate some are more barricade style that don t have an opening gate

that license plate is inscrutable
another thing ai will prevent in the future license plate interpretation what does the license plate ucum1st mean without any additional context or information it s impossible for me to provide a definitive meaning for the license plate ucum1st however if we were to take a guess based purely on the letters and numbers on the plate ucum1st could be interpreted in a few different ways you come first the letters ucum could be interpreted as you come and the number 1st could be interpreted as first together this could be read as a message of prioritizing the needs or desires of the driver or the person reading the license plate university of california urology department 1st if ucum is taken to represent university of california urology department and 1st is interpreted as first this license plate could be related to a doctor or student at the university of california who specializes in urology you see you i m first another possible interpretation could be that ucum is read as you see you and 1st is taken to mean i m first this could be interpreted as a boastful or self centered message
maine actually had no rules against personalized licesne plates until just recently https://apnews.com/article/maine-vanity-license-plates-profanities-1149eb44063bb3608574b2f017e6cc99), so there are a bunch of crazy ones out there
does this belong to a dyslexic communist
what s a ucumist s
i marvel that anyone would willingly pay extra for what is essentially a tax receipt
belongs to a prostitute
cool
in yo mouth
join the revolution comrade
why are all the funny plates from maine
y know the cum1stomer is king
missed opportunity it says maine right at the top main e cumslut would have been way funnier
a generous lover if i ever seen one on a license plate
and people say gallantry is dead
why does every tesla have one
ah well i guess it s time for a new start
you see you am 1st maybe they have broken english and they think you are number one did you ever think about that hmmm
icu81mi
chatgpt told me it doesnt know what this means without any context and that i should be ashamed of myself
ai is so dumb why is everyone impressed with this university urology department for pete s sake
ai wouldn t have prevented this plate from being issued this is maine they didn t slip this one past an unsuspecting old lady at the dmv maine let s you put just about anything on your plate
yes in name
i watched a guy drop his phone struggling to take a selfie with my plate i pay extra for some personalization and to give failing marriages something to talk about when i pass them on the highway
this guy up here with his plain blue credit card and keyring without a single keychain on it he s a real hoot at parties i bet
because until quite recently maine had no content based restrictions on vanity plates recently our legislature has forgotten how to read the first amendment and that s been changed but not all the fun ones have been recalled yet and of course the old pictures will circulate online forever
teslas are fairly expensive and because they aren t really all that great for the environment when bought new the people buying them are doing it as a status symbol or virtue signaling adding a custom license plate plays on that desire to be noticed source i made it the fuck up
i had to argue with it to get it to respond
deleted
not anymore lots of them are being revoked
i thought it was too either way it could be used as n insult a complement or a fact
yeah i don t think there s any person working at any dmv that saw cum and just wasn t smart enough to realize that was a forbidden word and if it is you don t need ai to detect it the simplest stupidest check for string function a computer from years ago could handle would do just fine the truth is maine allows these strings it s even a political issue there check this out https://apnews.com/article/maine-vanity-license-plates-profanities-1149eb44063bb3608574b2f017e6cc99](https://apnews.com/article/maine-vanity-license-plates-profanities-1149eb44063bb3608574b2f017e6cc99) maine had for several years allowed people to put just about any combination of letters and numbers on their vehicle plates including words and phrases that other states would ban but the state decided to change course and this year recalled plates it deemed inappropriate any human being would know that the urology or you see you meanings were not what was meant because generative ai is stupid and has no original thoughts only scrapped thoughts from billions of actual sources or intelligence humans tossed into a blender and spit back out only sometimes making the slightest bit of sense at all

when the funerals at and the screenings at
i once went to a showing of uhf years ago with only one other person in the theater i walked right up to them and said i think you are in my seat they did not appreciate the joke
you wore a suit to go see mario
i m picturing you watching the movies while drinking wine and eating your candy bar with a knife and fork
your movie goers are in another castle
strait black tie what is this a funeral wait
ain t no one taking kids to a movie on a wednesday night
we have jobs
where did you put your fedora
good thing you dressed appropriately
plot twist he actually made a detour on the way to his wedding
i didn t know jehovah witnesses went to movies
you are a bit underdressed no suspenders not even gloves
how was the movie
you had an interview at the imax place then they let you in to see mario as a consolation prize
well yeah it s a wednesday in the middle of the day people have things to do
hopefully that meant plenty of room to park your horse carriage
this dude wants to look nice for our favorite italian plumber
bro it s wednesday some of us have jobs oh shit that reminds me
let s a not gooo
singles convention
man i love having an empty movie theater
the other folks probably saw you in that suit and thought you were going to shoot the place up
i hope you greeted the women with m lady
that s a lot of john cenas enjoying the movie
what time was it
you could feel the raw energy in the air it was electromagnetic energy in the to nanometer range
i ve been in several screenings by myself when i go see some obscure movie on a pm on monday i once stood up for half the film because my back hurt and there was nobody there to complain it was very freeing
i feel like they marketed this thing so hard months ago then i haven t seen anything in the weeks leading up to the release i wouldn t have gone but i also had no idea it was out
idk is imax even worth it for the movie
did you enjoy the movie
i m a lonely person who usually goes to movies alone so it s always deeply uncomfortable and sometimes borderline depressing to be walking and be seated among people who have come with their families friends or relatives it s particularly troubling when people take notice of the fact that you re alone this one time i was at the movies it was an early afternoon on a weekday and so the crowd was small and for some strange reason most people there were solo viewers too which was great because i didn t feel like an odd man out that day i seated myself simply as one among many in a sparsely occupied theater and experienced a level of comfort i didn t know existed the movie was arrival and it turned out to be awesome so to this day i fondly remember this as my best movie going experience not relevant here but the small numbers reminded me of this day
i don t mean to be hateful or anything but i m just sick of hearing chris pratt s voice everywhere i turn they are really oversaturating him
it was almost for tickets two medium popcorn and two medium drinks for me and a friend to see john wick it s not worth it to go to the movies anymore
you look like the average reddit user
but only one of the viewers was dressed for a much nicer event
r chadtopia
im a sorryeo
you work there or do you usually go to the cinema in a suit and tie
ok but was it any good and was it the mario movie or the chris party trying to sound like mario movie
lookin fresh homie
why you wearing a suit and tie my guy
it was fuckin wednesday morning dude no demographic goes to wednesday morning show times
hahaha wtf are you wearing
a nice suit needs a professional shave and haircut
suit real neck beard vibes
i always wear a full suit and tie to the cinema as a sign of respect to my community
i saw super mario bros in 3d this afternoon and it was awesome
there s a mario movie
do imax staff have to wear suits
he was attending the funeral of this imax theater
looking sharp op
at my local theatre i went to watch honor among thieves and no one else arrived had the whole room to myself
didja like it
how was the movie
explain i m dumb lol
why are you going to the cinema impersonating abe lincoln
why you dressed like a reservoir dog
how bummed were you when you realized no one else thought that suit was funny
you wore a suit to a mario movie
did you go when elementary school is in session that would explain it
if i walked into the mario movie and saw some weirdo in a three piece suit i would turn the fuck around too
this is how i picture most redditors in my head
then it should be called imin
probably because it s a tuesday night and people have jobs
fuck the comments man i hope you enjoyed having the theater mostly to yourself and you look pretty damn sharp in that suit most people who try to knock down other people lack self love and awareness peace
well my theater is full so i ll go next week
why would you watch mario at an imax
walmart mr beast
took the kids we really enjoyed it fun plot great voice acting and lots of fan service
two things kids are in school neckbeard and lights are still on movie hasn t started
why the fuck did you wear a suit
but you sir are obviously a distinguished man of taste
woah you showed up and dressed up fancy
dafuc are you wearing a suit for
dressed formally as you should be
this dude is so out of touch he s doing the minions thing at the wrong movie a year too late and by himself
on the basis of this one post i will make a sweeping assumption that you should not be around my kid
my brother in christ it is wednesday in the afternoon that is not a natural time to go see a movie no matter who you are
must ve been a quiet night lol
what time is it
that s a definite victory
where s the others
everybody at amc bruh
i love it man do the best you in a suit of all the people making billions mario earns that kind of real respect
other people that wanted to go must ve seen a on the tomatometer and given up on it being a good movie
it s justa you mario
luck you i had elementary school students on a field trip in my theater my patience was tested so hard
fancy op
was the first showing like tuesday midnight or wednesday at 10am not really prime movie going hours for of the world
thats too bad on a positive note the teater i work at was completely sold out for the two first showings so i gus it is a local thing
hey man i think it s that you are wearing a suit keep going ps try going to the grocery store wearing a suit you will feel like you own the place
now that s lucky
some of us gotta work
man had i known i would have went i was going to wait a few weeks for it to calm down
for an hour and minute long movie was it worth it
was it good
every theater here in socal was packed was hard to find seats for midnight
and they are up there not to watch mario wink wink

i feel like cats came along when they realized that dogs were with us and they re kind of like do you see how dumb this thing is without realizing it themselves
i kept thinking of michael b jordan and i was so confused i was like did i miss something in mainstream news
since mbj has taken over this thread what s the b stand for bartholomew or something cool like that
there is only one michael jordan the other well being a great actor is not the real mj
yeah yeah but i was mega confused for a bit might ve been too early in the morning
agreed it s why they only call him michael b jordan they never leave out the b while referencing him
like thats the entire reason he had to add his middle initial to his stage name because as you said there indeed is only one mj lol
now that you ve apologized to the air man all is good
is that not his real name
that s his real name he used to get bullied for it in high school

where is funny this just hurts man
this depressed the shit out of me
bills in exchange for this unenjoyable life
water electricity what do you want today
slide in exchange for home and car slide something breaks
maybe time but not always energy just nap at work to keep that energy up
the bills give you stuff too like hot showers and internet
this is not funny
i saw a thing that i really identified with when you are young you have time and energy but not money when you are middle aged you have energy and money but not time when you are old you have money and time but not energy
pretty well true i was forced back into a line of work i left due to the instability but it pays so well in this current climate and i was so poor i lived not check to check but credit to credit life was fucking horrible better that i am paid well now but i give up even more time and more energy as the exchange
hey man it s not all bad bills gives you comfort in exchange for money
don t worry i ll give you some time back chucks the time ball as hard as they can go get it bitch
don t worry guys it s definitely not slavery if you wanted you could choose to be homeless and eat out of the garbage that s freedom
awe wage slavery the new normal
fuck the predatory healthcare system in this country i can t save anything because of them
why do i have three kids and no money why can t i have no kids and three money
god this is so accurate it hurts
pretty much
the mustaches chef s kiss
this is incredibly deep so deep you re drowning all the children
this is where you ask what bills want to do
laughs to endless pit of fiery depression
wait you guys have time and energy
taking away the money that work gave for bill pay fritter and waste time and energy again
this pops up as i m paying hospital bills
this must be one of those cry until you laugh jokes cuz i was crying now i m laughing because it s so sad dammit
think life for humans will always be like this
sometimes i m just remembered that reddit is full of parent
modern working industry it is just shit bro we need more time spending for our lifes
really going to needs g ovt square to go along with the pink bills one
to say we are an advanced civilization this comic shows what we are not all we do is work for money to pay bills and repeat everyday until we die
replace bills with taxes
needs two more frames one where big gubmint punches you in the gut second where big gubmint rolls you over and shakes out the remaining coins in your pockets to steal
sounds like it s time to switch jobs
so many comments about this but before the modern age most people had to work hours per day days a week just to put some food on the table modern humans have much more free time and much more money and are much healthier than most of history compared to before we live in the lap of luxury and have tons of free time granted there are third world countries that still struggle but i bet most people reading this aren t in that situation i m not saying that it doesn t suck but realistically we are much better off than pretty much any other time in human history
stop going to restaurants ordering food you re spending dollars on a meal which would cost you bucks at home if not more
you forgot to draw the tattoos and piercings and the iphone and all the uber eats receipts and all the marked up ironic political stickers from etsy
replace bills with govt tired of them taking a of my paycheck upfront then requiring me to pay for things and taking some of that too and then making me use services way higher priced than they should be because they subsidize markets
don t know why but i was expecting bills to be cheeked up

saddly my life
life
poor physics energy joules is work joules work joules over time seconds is power watts and as we all know time seconds is money dollars and the bills are a shitty team
mutha effers
honestly that last one needs to be government
this one hurt
should have one guy at the end who the bills hands the money in an expensive suit and he just throws it into his huge ballpit of money balls
hurts man
pink floyd always knew that time and money are the great forces in life
remember all of that stuff you don t think about because it s just there most likely done by people who likewise wish they could do something else with their time yah that s bills should have another huge ominous figure lurking in the background just behind the door claws and teeth looking hungry and ready to eat the protagonist alive just as he finds a tiny bit of money left in his pockets it says taxes
here s some funny gives meme in exchange for this takes brain cells
its funny cause its true
the accuracy makes you laugh until you cry not happy tears mind you tears of loathing and regret
i wouldn t care except for the style theme and props are straight up ripoffs of another creator shen why does it feel like everyone started making their own webcomics recently it seems like they re being made by the aspiring artists despite a complete lack of original ideas just to pump out a certain quantity of crap to take advantage of whatever algorithm
i looked at my wife and said want to see something that ll make you sad and she said no i said i m gonna show you anyway she read it scowled at me and said i said no i find depressing truths to be funny in a way that concerns people
bills in exchange for this hour long warm shower
this meme is where my mind has been all day
you re not alone also i m sorry
i fell asleep while playing a video game with friends the long commutes are back and i m dying
what do you wanna do today
i m laughing while dying inside scrolling reddit at work
and people wonder why i say life isn t worth living
to hangout with all three of us together
to not die of thirst or exposure i guess
unless you re a bus driver or something
if they re not taking all your energy you boss will come knocking to ask why you re not working as hard as everyone else
what job do you have that you can nap at work
hot showers where you can reflect on how shitty your life is and the internet where you can read about reflecting on your shitty life underneath hot showers
but according to this you re too tired and don t have time to do either
i don t know the math but i bet gathering sticks setting them on fire and heating water with it then sitting around the fire and talking sharing memes takes less than hours and is more enjoyable also you re allowed to stop whenever you want for a nap which is the dream those would be my priorities anyway if i could make a wish
i want to commission an art piece that illustrates this it s beautifully depressing
comfort you can t enjoy because you don t have time and energy
bills gives you comfort in exchange for money i don t make enough for comfort best i can do is a slightly warmer and drier form of misery
i mean in a way you kinda have to be impressed how quickly the ruling elite got their slaves back they did it in like years oh you didn t like how we made some people slaves based on arbitrary differences so sweet good for you now you all get to be slaves
true this is the first time in history people had to work to survive
then go to canada
move to a red state soon you ll be able send your kids off to coal mines again
i need a life guard
as opposed to before where we had to work from sunup until sundown days a week just to get food in the table for the most part modern humans have more free time and more money than ever before
we used to work from sunup until sundown days a week just to get food on the table modern humans have a life of luxury and ease compared to most of human history
bills have never needed to exist the state can bulk buy to keep costs down rather than the individual signing very one way contracts with powerful agents
taxes is how we pay for society the people who cry about taxes being theft are the ones who would still be drooling cave dwellers if the rest of us did not drag them into civilization and modernity
seriously just get a job that pays a lot without requiring any time or energy
so just cause things are better today for some people means we shouldn t be trying to get things even greater for everyone
yes you too can be the transaction between your boss and your electricity company and have no life with no material value to call your own
r oddlyspecific
i bet you re tired of driving on government subsidized roads getting bailed out by government subsidized unemployment using government subsidized piwer grid and etc sure there are issues but it still provides a lot of actual functions now if you replace government with corporations now there s a target lol
i ll be taking that reposter steels meme
hahahaha
so r funnyandsad
the number of webcomics that are just not funny or creative drives me crazy especially when someone shamelessly spams their comic everywhere
i was thinking the exact same thing shen made concepts as physical things his main schtick after doing a wider variety of topics with owlturd and or blue chair
that is as much as an art style as stick figures and doodles can you copyright crap what am i saying of course you can
i dont even have 15mins of warm water t t
great comic
satan i ll be taking that in exchange for this x200b enjoyable life
this should be higher i appreciate dark humor
especially if you re a bus driver
there are necessities and there are luxuries and these days hot showers and internet are necessary luxuries just to keep us sane all so we don t wake up one day and take a shortcut to the people oven

going to be an entertaining child to raise
daddy can t thats illegal
i m not gonna lie i can draw better boobs than that
i m years older than my sister when she was like or years old she drew a character on a sheet of paper and walked up to me telling me to look at her drawing i take a look at her drawing and notice a small oval between the legs i ask her what that oval is and she says oh that s his penis i burst out laughing and my mother who was also in the room got very angry at her she was pissed and told my sister to not draw such things today i still laugh when i think about it
for the ones who might not now it s a natural progression for kids to draw everything at one stage first is the obvious fact they don t quite understand what s prudent or not but the real point is they haven t developed a sense of layers yet so they ll happily draw themselves or others wearing pants and a penis it s pretty much the same logic as hiding behind the curtains thinking that you can t see them since they can t see you the progression is roughly like this years doodling years heads with feet and arms attached no torso years more detailed a body begin to show up the size of the object often signify importance parents and siblings are usually larger than other objects like a neighbor or friend in the same drawing for instance you can usually recognize who they are depicting years proper bodies with torsos they have usually found a personal template to draw certain things like cats dogs cars etc each kid form their own personal template but they all have them they can now start varying the template one cat might be striped while one is spotted but it s pretty much the same cat shape all the time the objects are reasonably proportionate at this point years a baseline for the drawing begin to occur most commonly a green line or something that represent the ground the objects are standing on additional baselines show up like clouds the sun things for background figures to stand on a sense of spatial awareness emerge late in this stage the kid often begin to realize the story telling potential of a drawing they might add figures from a cartoon and so on around years old kids begin to understand likeness often being frustrated and not being able to draw things at the level of likeness that they would like understanding perspectives and story telling devices like frames in a comic book show up here as well what s cool about this and far too long post is that the development here is very similar for all kids there s not that much you can do to teach a three year old to draw better they re likely to follow the path above as part of their natural development seeing this kid want to draw boobs here is so very natural i wanted to make sure everyone realize it
goddamn those houses are close together
how often do you see gru living on that street and all
she will be very successful in the future
lol nothing will stop the urge for kids to learn grow and want to be mature faster
hahah daddy said no way not me
why not d
i wish mine looked like circles now they are u u s
at least she has something to look forward to
this family s values
it s a kid wanting to draw a very natural body part it doesn t have to be sexualized or wrong and the parents should have handled it better in my opinion instead of instilling an idea of shame or wrongness in a developing kid s self awareness you have to separate the sexualized nature of the modern world and the adult mind from the curiosity of a child s when you are teaching them these very basic biological features and functions sure there are limits as to what a kid should be exposed to and all that but this is as innocent as it gets mom has boob ies for food only dad thinks they are fun to play with the two ideas should not be mixed and in this case it seems counter productive to act like this it seems like a rather american religious perhaps way of seeing it i would dare say i mean what he doesn t take baths with his kids because he is afraid of being labeled a pedo i read children s books about the human body sex birth and all that with illustrations of the naked body at the age of because i was curious and my mom got the books for me in the 80s that didn t traumatize me what did affect me was the sexual shame put on me by my mother because in her youth in iran there was a lot of shame tied with sex and women she never said anything bad but hearing hear avoid the subject act flustered or in general just never answering those questions gave me this inherent shame that i am still affected by to this day that is despite her buying me kids biology books on the subject in my early teens she changed her outlook completely however which helped but having to go with those thoughts and questions alone for so many years did give me some weird ideas that my sex drive which i developed in my teens was shameful and bad fuck me i am ranting like crazy based on this short video i am not going to judge that guy specifically they are probably great parents having a bit of fun i speak in more general terms and i am sick and lying in bed and can t sleep so bear with me and my wall of text just don t shy away from answering kids questions or teaching them things because your adult mind is fucked ps i realize that different subjects need varying levels of details and explanation based on age and sensitivity
bro wth
its sad to see a body part be shunned due to puritanical views
where does a three year old get the idea that she should have boobies not going after the parents here it s really pervasive in na culture
a dad has two jobs raising a daughter get em off the dole keep em off the pole this might not end well good luck dad
how often should i see this video man reposts sucks
perfect example how lefties are sexualilizing kids
why is this creep asking his child to draw boobs
uhm what
double ds
and she is screaming boobies at the top of her lungs

can t make this stuff up
adorable how she says boobies
it s funny i have two girls and one wants boobies so the other wants to know why her nipples are too thin which is a hard question to understand never mind being insisted on answering as to why that is mommy my son think they are both crazy
bro this got me hahaha he was in straight flight mode
that s illegal

prove it
i liked the belly button phase all of my kids had a phase when every humans the would draw had belly buttons
my brothers and i all did the heads with arms and legs coming out except there was an extra line in the middle for the dick mum didn t get thee extra line though obviously even our male cat had extra dick line added haha
interesting thanks
think of the time you ll save on yard maintenance
looks like british columbia canadas suburbs at least anything built after are all like this unless you re hours outside major cities
must be new jersey
my neighbors would alway see me naked i m terrible at closing the blinds
first thing that came to mind for me as well lol
nothing like smelling your neighbors shit after they drop a deuce
welcome to the american dream all the hearing your neighbors through the walls of an apartment but with all the wasted energy of a single family home probably has a hoa too so you can have all the responsibility of owning a house with all the restrictions of a shitty landlord
americans will do anything to not build semi detached townhouses
yea but that sliver of air on both sides means you can say you own a single free standing or detached house
haha u called it
it s amusing when a kid puts boobies on a drawing themselves the problem becomes when the parent is instructing them to do it
it s not that deep it was a funny little situation
i mean what he doesn t take baths with his kids because he is afraid of being labeled a pedo unfortunately if a guy posted on social media that he took baths with his kid i wouldn t be shocked if someone put cps on him
i d agree with you in any other context but in this case it s just a dad who doesn t feel comfortable drawing his underage daughter s boobs i know there s nothing sexual about it but sadly the female body has been sexualised to the point where even drawing non reproductive parts like the breast can come off the wrong way
it s perfectly normal for a year old to know their anatomy as to why they d know this kids are super curious about everything especially their bodies so they tend to ask questions books or even parents educating them about their bodies it s really pervasive in na culture may i ask why
i don t have any daughters but i thought all girls wanted to be like mommy i e grown women and the only difference children see is breasts and height
i think there are more jobs than that
what do boobs have to do with being a stripper is the association partly because thats the only time you ever see them
is dole grugs
intent was sarcasm i ll consider these upvotes raised two kids both college grads gainfully employed no boomerangs live life with a sense of humor ya live longer um both kids do have a warped sense of humor though wonder why
yes let s prevent everyone else from seeing this because this one person is tired of seeing it you know you can just keep scrolling right
what s being sexualized here you know breasts have more functions than being a category on your favorite porn site
yet it s usually righties that are convicted of child molestation the church politicians etc
what makes you think these people are lefties and how are they sexualizing their kids the dude is making a point of not drawing boobs on a representation of his underage daughter it s his daughter insisting that she have boobs where are lefties telling underage girls they should have boobs if anything last i heard the leftist narrative was that there s a variety of body types out there and boobs or lack thereof are what defines a woman
he didn t his daughter wanted to and asked him to draw them but he denied you might wanna get your hearing checked or you just have a smooth brain and cant comprehend a conversation

those tits are saggy

yeah it s so cool when they discover a certain detail and add it to their drawings another one i like is when they start adding teeth to the smiles
yes i never enjoyed overly excessive cleavage either
true but when you sneeze your neighbor say god bless you
yeah this is all america is no sort of variety in housing at all
dad at any age drawing his daughters boobs seems odd but she just wants accurate body parts give her two dots and let her improve if she wants
not all women have prominent round breasts like the ones she drew that s not knowing your anatomy she doesn t have tits like that and she may never develop tits like that as for why the expectation that women should have big round breasts is so pervasive in na culture i have some guesses but i m no sociologist my first thought would be that because breasts particularly prominent ones are a pretty clear signifier of one s sex and lots of people out there have this need for women to be vastly different from men and anything that blurs that distinction like having a small chest is considered undesirable
i m actually really curious about her response that was cut off at the end of the video if she was drawing them because she s a girl and girls have boobies i d take issue with that as an expectation and want to know where she got it from but i m obviously not her parent and in the minority with this opinion
it s social assistance
their username checks out
i m sorry if my comment came the wrong way i was referring to boobs in general

lmfao i m using that from now on space between two houses house cleavage
a year old isn t drawing very size appropriate anatomy at that age rudimentary at best and it s not like kids just don t notice them i have a memory of being probably and asking my mom what the things on her chest were that i didn t have a word for
i interpreted your og comment as referring to a child s knowledge of breasts in general rather than the size of breasts that you mentioned later the way i see it she was just drawing the outlines of the breasts i think you jumped the gun a little by assuming she was drawing large breasts like having a small chest is considered undesirable yah true this where women can t really win it s not just the small chests that are considering undesirable but also large chests i say we don t take criticism from people who associate with these beliefs values every body is different and that s okay i m not really sure if belief is the correct word to be used here correct me if i m wrong
this comment is so fucking weird dude you re talking about a year old drawing something she probably sees on her mom or other female family members on herself this is just kid shit why the hell are you talking about if she ll develop tits like that feels gross just quoting you
i don t know what that guy s smoking i found your comment funny and not inappropriate
boobies got a lift
cleavage yard
the one s she drew aren t even that big but they re clearly an important feature my question could also be phrased as why does she consider breasts to be an important feature for women insofar as she grows up to be a woman if she doesn t grow noticeable breasts there s a decent chance she ll object to that and might feel the need to get surgery to change it a lot of women do and i personally find the culture that sets up these expectations obnoxious at best
yard milkshake
why does she consider breasts to be an important feature for women one of the many reasons as to why she might consider it important to feminity might be women around and the media of course insofar as she grows up to be a woman if she doesn t grow noticeable breasts again you re jumping the gun by assuming she drew large breasts kids don t care if the breasts are small or not they don t understand the disgusting societal standards i personally find the culture that sets up these expectations obnoxious at best agreed the culture sucks however i see nothing wrong with breast implants or breast reduction if that s what it takes to make someone happy also i made a small edit to my og comment check it out
boys boys
agreed the culture sucks that s the point i was making at three she s decided that breasts are an important element of femininity of her identity big enough to be noticeable big enough to be worth drawing in despite her being a long ways off of even potentially having any hence my question where did she learn this i m not even calling out media here it s quite possible it s just something she s heard in enough conversations that it s sunk in
is it better than yours yes

when i try this stuff my dog just stares at me and barks now he s had just about enough of my bullshit
the loading part had me in stitches
i tried this with my dogs after a few time they just got pissed and attacked me went down something like this https://phoneky.co.uk/thumbs/screensavers/down/fun/bunnyattac_5vq2yho3.gif](https://phoneky.co.uk/thumbs/screensavers/down/fun/bunnyattac_5vq2yho3.gif)

i find this quite fascinating you get an insight into how their brain functions magicians employ the same technique to trick human brain so i guess we do share some similarity with dogs

wow now that shoul ve been the title
the only difference is humans can understand it and won t fall for it again but dogs can fall for the same puzzles over and over and never figure it out i m not saying they will never figure it out but a good chance they never will dogs when studied show their ability to perform tasks that involve logic are about the ability of a year old human
in swindled off his ball had me so bamboozled that i didn t check what i was typing

snaps spaghetti in half cooks it until it s mush pours jar of ketchup into it adds raisins not even god can save you now
reminds me of that video where a guy delivered pizza with pineapple slices to an italian neighborhood edit for anyone looking for the sauce https://youtu.be/eduy3y_w9tk
that s horrible you don t put whole slices on you put chunks on it spread out so you get some in at least every other bite
bowser this is a too far
pineapple on pizza and nickelback are two internet trends that i didn t realize people took seriously i thought people overwxaggerated their hate of both for comedic reasons but no some yall vehemently hate pineapple on pizza and actually judge others for it pretty sad
i don t get it they re going to enjoy a delicious hawaiian pizza
that kind of pineapple slice is what the pineapple on pizza haters think of when they argue that it doesn t belong
mario s a new yorker if you want to torture him with pizza you offer him chicago deep dish https://youtu.be/jcgymftxuuw)
bacon and pineapple are amazing on pizza fight me
mario is a r knightsofpineapple he wouldn t mind
but pineapple on pizza is delicious
mmm so good italians need to to try it
the moment bowser jr adds the sweet drizzle marios gonna not able to hold back super mario will rise in that moment
they did a similar joke for the sonic the hedgehog cartoon the french lad on their team gets captured and for torture they fry escargot except not in butter then the protests and squirming
we ll see about that puts on crown
guess i m bowser that s exactly what i have planned on picking up on the way to the drive in thursday night
i will die on the jalapeo pineapple ham pizza hill it s delicious
please mark this nsfl
you remember that scene from casino royale where they cut the hole in the chair exact same thing happening here
how can anyone think this is funny
why does mario get several orders of magnitude more buff in each frame
go ahead add anchovies too i can take it
mmmmmm yummy
evil bastard
now envision this as that scene in berserk i think mario might change his mind
i think pineapple on pizza is one of those things like nickelback where the internet just hates it because they were told to and they want to jump on the bandwagon but it s actually not that bad
idk what you mean that s how pizza is supposed to be eaten
gotta watch out for that pineapple pizza https://youtu.be/bjbpyopzv3a)
hey brochacho try before you deny

pasta with strawberries cream and quark

you need to fix baby bowsers dialogue it should be got it papa
some great quotes from this movie or perhaps he s wondering why you d firedall a koopa before throwing him out of an airship bowser if i jump on you would you die toad team six it would be extremely painful for you bowser i m the koopa kingdom s reckoning here to end the borrowed time you ve been living on bowser my mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men peach this isn t a car mario rainbow road music intensifies it has a long uninteresting name i just took to calling it the kart and yes mr mario it does come in red pro e gadd
i d love for bowser to look even meaner in frame and
why is mario s dialogue all in an english accent should it not be like it sa me a mario you know like authentic italian
inhale maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
mario needs to bite down on that poison tooth super quick respawn outside the ropes and take them down for that crime also i ve had pineapple on pizza not great not terrible
the pineapple slice looks exactly like i imagine bowser s butthole looks
mario knows pineapple on pizza is delicious
fun fact you can also torture italians by adding hotdog and ketchup on pasta

never have i related more with mario
that sir is a hate crime
i don t think we can show this much violence on theatre

fuck mario more pineapple
pizza the only place pineapple isn t disgusting
this won t happen but i hope bowser gets the super crown that turns him into a girl in the movie
well i didn t see that coming
unfortunately he s not italian in the movie
that guy holding joe pesci s head really deserved a bigger paycheck he really tied the room together
noo you gotta slice them
the best type of pizza is that invented in canada bring on the pineapple
jojo
he made me watch
at least he didn t put on the princess crown
bowser looks genuinely happy
okay that is pure evil
despite common belief mario isn t actually italian he s american specifically a new yorker he just has italian ancestry
yup that would do it
you monster you unbelievable monster
that s dark
that could do it fruit on a pizza is an atrocity of global consequences
may i ask what the hate is for pineapple on pizza like i ve seen a lot of weird things put on pizza but that never gets attacked like pineapple
did mario hit a growth spurt in the last panel
you ll pay for this you pizza shit
from nintendo world at universal studios mario may or may not eat it but has a more important message https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5ibppxd3k2k)
i too saw the meme with joe pesci about torturing italians by putting pineapple on pizza

i m still mad they didn t include bowser jr
the official waluigi wario pizza with fucking sprinkles is so much worse
i feel attacked
if you have steam i highly recommend the game pineapple on pizza about minutes of gameplay and you will not regret it
https://www.reddit.com/r/fakehistoryporn/comments/da1745 here s the inspiration
last bit reminds me of the last scene in casino
pineapple on pizza is great y all need to stop lying to yourselves
master skywalker we didn t know what you want on your pizza so we got pineapple lightsaber ignites
i love it when it s a whole ring especially when it s grilled
the pizza he man
i know two people who like pineapple on pizza and they re both italian
i m italian i have your ip address i m coming
i like pineapples on pizza liking pineapples and pizza in general probably helps and i still wonder what the fuss is about at the core we re technically talking baked bread with various stuff thereon and using fruit among this stuff is supposed to be a shocker where i live one popular and damn tasty dish popular as in not uncommon on the table during big party and celebration meals is fried white bread slices with mayonnaise fresh tomatoes and canned sprats thereon like at once and here we still raise cain around pineapples
good god spoiler tag as nsfl
screams in italian
came here to say well most of this raisins what
filipino spaghetti allow me to introduce myself
as an italian canadian who makes his sauce from scratch all the time this offends me to the fullest fyi people need to start making their sauce from scratch minutes of prep hour of simmering and you can eat like an actual italian and it s much cheaper than buying jarred shit at the store
snaps spaghetti in half cooks it until it s mush adds a spoon of oil into the spaghetti water
raisisns but why raisins raisins don t go into sauce
ketchup what is this amatures hour unscrews bbq sauce bottle i thought we were torturing them
this comment needs to be tagged as nsfw immediately
i was with you until the raisins please don t hurt me
i was picturing a shot where you can only see a shadow of bowsers shell as he s making repeated jerks downward like he s hitting something and you re hearing snaps and cracks along with mario screaming in pain and begging for it to stop then you pan over and see bowser is just snapping handfuls of dry spaghetti
that sounds danish that survey had danes approving of ketchup on pasta
you better not go to italy in the foreseeable future i see some guys waiting wanting to cap your knees
you forgot to add a cup of sugar to the sauce to cut the acidity

that is an s mercedes wheel those things are heavy af
don t laugh that could have ended wheely badly
man i hate it when that happens so tiresome
hi honey how did your meeting with the loan officer go
all these new drone weapons are getting out of hand
pppfff staged i saw that wheel in another video
they made a movie about a tire that went around killing people i believe it was called rubber
straight up assassin
is this a scene of the new remake of the omen
hey mr wheels how u doing
nice gol
hot wheels
i want one of those
i think the meeting was a blast
that was obviously the lobby to a retirement home
wheel has entered the chat
i bet he s tires of getting hit in the face
now that s a rim job
seek and destroy
i mean what are the odds nowhere safe anymore d
you are given 100m but for the rest of your life you are pursued relentlessly by a bouncing wheel do you take the money
r fuckyouinparticular
get ready for a shock
that was personal
r fuckyouinparticular
i think this is a grudge of a past life
it could end with bad causes
that guy got really tired
ahhhhh nothing like a repost
good ball good
that tire had that man s name on it
it s not the first time he s getting tired of this shit
rubber https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1612774/
out of all the final destination ass things i ve seen on reddit this has to top it it s exactly like the movie rubber where s there is literally a smart tire that hunts people down
you don t choose the wheel harry the wheel chooses you
yes here is an example of one of our wheels right her sir
that wheel is going places in life rolled in front the street and played a part in a business meeting sounds ambitious
no pete don t buy that timeshare they will steal the car off your back
bro tap straffed in real life
that is some final destination shit
they made a sequel to rubber
being late for meeting be like
the only thing that could make this exact incident worse is if the tow was balls and the steel cords were frayed on the edge those things will go through a leather glove
it just wasn t their time wow
man s had a good year i ll show myself out
don t buy the car
don t buy the car
mr yokohama says hello
reminds me of the movie rubber
the wheel remembers what you did it will come for you next if your not careful
how did mary die a tire hit her in the face
just out here wheelin and dealin
good luck
how do you say rubber in albanian
if you let my brothers go now that ll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you don t i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you yeah you made it pretty clear by crashing alone single handedly into their office
in slow motion he moves so he either hears something and turns to the right to look at the door inadvertently moving out of the way or his spidey senses kicked in
true aren t tires heavyweight this is not even funny
seriously ever since i saw that video where a car gets flipped up into the air because it hit a wheel i m terrified of these things
i know it barely michelin them
i m so tired of these videos
rubberto got his first taste of blood no one is safe
ah shit you were here first great movie
meeting was long i got tired out of nowhere
i think he sees the terror in the eyes of the guy he s talking to behind desk he sees it coming and reacts because a 120lb missile is coming at him at 50mph
is the combo of not only weight but speed and inerita from the speed and rotational velocity on top of that
you ve barely touched the rim
same beat me to it
these make my eyes roll
i don t know man i saw the tire and i got pumped

okay but this is such a great way to identify your own fluency level with honesty
this is a good opportunity to remind inform that the french dubbing is extremely good this is the only american show that i prefer seeing in my mother tongue and not just by nostalgia
le grill what the hell is that
what did they do for the episode where bart was abducted in france and forced to make wine and suddenly learns french
isn t ralph wiggum the dumbest character of the show if she s at a homer simpson level then she s at a level congrats
to be honest i d be surprised if i could understand something in french even if it s homer
la connaissance du franais nous embiggens tous c est une langue parfaitement cromulante
seems relevant https://youtu.be/cfsah9hmqsa
sphericoulgne boulagerie i suppose it s how they call doughnuts in france but i don t know french so i could be wrong
redditors find this funny
it s always weird to see how our perspective fucks with our perception this sorta topic being a great example i only speak french at an year old level yeah but you ve been studying it for 4th that time that s a great thing this is something i absolutely struggle with the assumed perfection and i should be able that kneecaps any attempt for improvement
i don t get the last panel why is it funny
excellent use of woo hoo
this is about panels too long
now try the quebec dub
me talk pretty one day
that s a really phenomenal way to learn though and a great way to measure progress as someone who grew up bilingual and studied in bilingual institutions i only started realizing after graduation that monolinguals have a fucking hard time picking out even the sounds or patterns of mere words in other languages nevermind understanding the words just following the sounds and identifying what might be a word picking out one character in a show in another language and just learning enough to understand that without subtitles even with context clues is genuinely a big linguistic milestone monolinguist anglophones legit be proud of yourselves when you reach this point and consider that you re better at this multilingual thing that you thought
le grille
as a francophone canadian i find the metropolitan french unbearable on the simpsons give me the quebec french any day i m in moncton i am acadian not qubcois
you may be interested in some differences in the france and quebec dubs as highlighted in this cbc article https://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/blog/twitter-user-pinpoints-the-differences-between-france-and-quebec-dubs-of-the-simpsons-and-they-re-hilarious-1.5239185).
that was an awful comic holy f
wasn t there an episode where homer tricks marge into teaching him french tres bien
i m a maggie
that s like me learning finnish
even in french you know lisa is just bitching about some cause of the week
if i wanted to learn spanish is the simpsons a good show to use for learning
you could say you perfectly understand a nuclear engineer speaking in french
piiiinaise
i ve started watching the show from the very beginning so many characters have much different personalities homer is not nearly as stupid in season
my buddy does this with the simpsons except for in italian it s pretty cool that this isn t a unique thing
oui oui baguette
lisa is quebecois
this pretty much describes every immigrant in any country
this doesn t even make sense lol homer says all the same words everyone else on the show does
unrealistic no one watches the simpsons anymore
french isn t a real language
do you want to try watching the simpsons in french no
nous vouse bonjour un deux trois lundi mardi demanche sud nord oui and that s the extent of french i know i tried learning once and it didn t go well maybe i should give it another try
no one wants to learn french
c est peut tre la bire qui parle mais tu as un cul qui ne veut pas cinq dollars sors d ici
i haven t watched the simpsons since at least i thought they had all passed away
the french france voices of the simpsons as is tradition with french dubs are fucking horrible can t change my mind it s almost like a guy opened the voice actor union book and picked random names then told them to do a voice of what they thought the character sounded like
there are two versions of the french simpsons too double challenge https://simpsons.fandom.com/fr/wiki/%c3%89quipe_fran%c3%a7aise_de_doublage https://doublage.qc.ca/p.php?i=162&idmovie=3103 one for the european french speakers one for quebec laurentian french speakers for those of you who understand french you should try both they vary wildly to the point that i won t watch the european version at all
meh jokes are not as good as the language the material was made for
i hated french being forced to learn it by a horribly rude teacher all because of quebec they really are the worst province around the only thing i learned was can i please go to the bathroom so i could hide in the bathroom all class
je doit l envoyer
if avatar the last airbender is in german this may help me a lot
what happens in the french language version for this scene https://youtu.be/8ke3x67x3ge)? i seem to recall remembering it was in italian or something lol
it s the woo hoo that really sells it
c est la manifique
this is a really smart way to help learn a language
me currently learning spanish
tres bien
we used to watch episodes of the simpsons in german class in school seems like a great way to learn conversation level listening and comprehension if only i didn t know the entire episodes by heart in english
not sure i d even be homer level and i ve actually tried to learn tried and failed
my german teacher told us the simpsons was the main way he learned german
this is very cute
you can only go up
le wueaxhueax
nadie qui parlant l allemande peut etre un mal homme
watch austin powers in french its great
my french isn t even homer level yet
is homer french better or worse than french canadian drywaller french
homer is not the dumbest character by far
as an american living in canada with years of french under my belt i feel personally attacked
tutor humor classic
i m at a jesse pinkman level of spanish since i learned by immersion i know how to talk in heavy slang and swear a blue streak but stick me in a classroom and i d tank even a 9th grade test i m fine with it tbh i understand what people are saying and they understand me i ll get around to more academic spanish at some point
je comprends riens de ce qu ils dise est ce qu on peut me l expliquer svp
le gril qu est ce que c est

considering i can already quote the simpsons almost verbatim this may be a decent way to learn
le doh
little fact french dub is matt groenings favorite dub for the simpsons cet homme a dcidment d excellents gots
oh un billet de vingt dollars je voulais une cacahute vingt dollars a fait un paquet de cacahutes comment a l argent peut tre chang contre des biens ou des services wouhou
d eaux hast
oh punaise https://youtu.be/un1nk194n3m)
he actually says punez a more polite form of putain which pretty much means fuck
is that really what om err says in the french dubbing wouldn t that sound like he was saying water rather than a nonsense sound of surprise what does he really say
french homer doesn t say d eaux he says t oh
i took years of german in school but haven t had anyone to speak to in years i m in the us then i met a mom friend from germany i couldn t have a conversation with her but i could understand everything she said to her toddler so i have the fluency of a year old
i had studied french off and on for two decades before i had the chance to attend three weeks of immersion school in france my goal was to get to that illustrious point of being at immigrant janitor level keeping up enough in a store that no one forces me to speak english instead which always felt like a moment of failure speaking and understanding enough that i know when i m being insulted or chided knowing enough to tell bleach from ammonia etc i knew i was on the right track when i got a euro discount card from a contest at carrefour later on i got the joke about the 3j sale trois jours being more like a 3s trois semaines sale while i was ringing out at printemps
i recently watched bluey in spanish on the suggestion of my spanish teacher i m a native english speaker was pretty fluent by college then stopped practicing then picked it up at my local community college at it was great practice each episode is only seven minutes it s great and it s hilarious i did think i was missing a bunch of dialogue from one character i finally turned on the subtitles in spanish and it turns out muffin just does a lot of incoherent screaming
it s also a great way to practice and learn a foreign language because dialogs are usually pretty simple and it uses everyday language there is even a progression watch with foreign audio but your language as subtitles as a back up then foreign audio and foreign subtitles as a back up then foreign audio no subtitles
but lisa doesn t actually use more complicated words language than homer very often she may talk about more complex topics but generally speaking the language is more or less the same
i remember being in my 4th year of german and being told we re at about a 1st grade level
teach somebody american english and then have them watch scottish television they ll feel as if they learned everything wrong
same for the latam spanish one homer s actor is a legendary man amongst latinos
i hated the french version but the french canadian one was very fitting and preferable to me
south park is really nice in french too the only shows movies i don t mind or even prefer to watch in french
if by french you mean french canadian then yes i d even dare to say that it s better than the original but the french french version is absolutely horrible
i now need to know what this scene sounds like in the french dub
well in the french canadian version they gave the french a very caricatural accent and they couldn t understand bart because of his accent which isn t that far from the truth when you are a french canadian visiting paris
oh yeah totally forgot about that one it was in season or and never mentioned again
at work atm but iirc it s super disappointing in the france version the language element when he talks to the police officer for example is not there at all the cop completely understands him but ignores him thinking he s just some street rat until bart tells him they re poisoning the wine
i need to hear french ralph say i bent my wookie
moi chouer en franais c est anpossible
allez banane
i guess you re at a maggie level in french

but then you finally give up trudge through the rain to the house and as you step dripping through the door rain stops
as a scandinavian if we did this we would never leave our cars not going outside because it s raining has never even occurred to me waiting for it to stop here basically if it rains it s going to rain the whole day if it doesn t rain chances are it still will at some point
lmao no i live in the pnw and i d be stuck in my car from october to june if i had to wait until the rain stopped
no i have not it is h2o it won t kill or harm you unless it is in the form of baseball sized hails then i would wait
in the words of my mother what re you made out of sugar
i ve done this just to enjoy the peace of listening to the rain from inside my car
no it s just a little rain even if it s a lot of rain it doesn t hurt and is mildly annoying for a short period of time at worst
and then after waiting forever you finally go to heck with it you open your door step out and bam way worse downpour hits you in the face source http://www.sheldoncomics.com/archive/230403.html](http://www.sheldoncomics.com/archive/230403.html)
that isn t funny i d venture to say it s actually r mildlyinfuriating
when you go from wondering why your eyes are on your forehead to wondering how you got into one of unit s human sized vacuum chambers in three panels
yes but only for those crazy cloudbursts in florida and hawaii
i just spark a blunt pass tf out i love listening to rain
or rains harder then you make a break for it and after you get inside it quits raining
nah
when something like this inconvenienced me in the past i d be like well this is where we live now
yes but no sure how it is funny
fuck no could be in there all day i ll just run
ha some of us are immune to this happy crap we have an umbrella at our desk one in the car and one at home take that unpredictable texas weather
why would you do this just go inside it s just some water
thats the moment you feel like a total loser
a ha ha ha ha yes
this damn shit happened to me yesterday i see it s lightly raining out check the radar and see more serious stuff coming my way so i m like alright time for dinner before i can t go out hit the drive thru still lightly raining drive home pull into the parking lot still lightly raining open car door cats and dogs so i wait a few minutes in hopes that it would get better nope walk inside rain stops completely for minutes bastards
well at least your rain turns white now and then not so much this side of the north sea unless you re danish then you get to watch the rain from a nice chair and i m sure you get used to the smell of wet pigs

it s a fun movie highlighting empowering femininity rather than requiring an adopting of masculine characteristics by the female leads to persevere at it s core it s a story about a lady succeeding because she was a lady not because she s a special lady distinct from the rest
makes me want a hot dog real bad
they should ve play white chicks
coulda been worse they were considering thelma and louise
i would have gone with erin brockovich personally
no way my school did the exact same thing and movie
i ve never watched it why would they show that movie for women s history month
at least she is a bio female
they tried
after party is at their insurance company
hidden figures much bettet
not sure what is wrong is a good movie
it has nothing to do with women s history

aaa hahaha i love that movie dont hate me cuz u aint me
more of a black history month movie and people probably wouldn t complain if it was played then
it s really good and reese crushes it at this point it s old enough to be historic as well
no idea it s a fictional movie about a woman who goes to law school to try to get her boyfriend back and prove she can get into complete harvard because he dumped her for someone more sophisticated
it s hilarious lol
true but it s a month about remembering women and this is a fun family event they aren t exactly going to put on hours of intense interviews with prominent women or harrowing depictions of the challenges women face it s gonna be smth fun so people don t hate the experience of learning about women s history as such this movie does a fine job
you have nothing to do with women or history
first it s entertaining pretty sure drive in night should be light hearted secondly its actually a decent empowerment flick have you seen it who is she at the beginning versus at the end how does she grow are these conversations you re even interested in having doesn t seem like it
that s just the start of her journey she decided to put in the hard work and ended up being really good at law and she used her girly traits to succeed rather than how other powerful woman movies make the character succeed only when she acts less girly
but this isn t an experience of learning about women s history lol during women s history month lol
i m a woman the history part is true i haven t done anything memorable enough to be in a history book during women s history month we celebrate the countless women who have fought tirelessly and courageously for equality justice and opportunity in our nation tell me what has elle woods done for your country
how about a movie like harriet harriet tubman or on the basis of sex ruth bader ginsburg or suffragette a league of their own hidden figures a team of women who worked at nasa during the early days of the space program you can have all those discussions and more with a much better movie that is based more directly on an actual historical figure
yes i enjoy the movie just found it entertaining funny that this is the movie they chose for women s history month a fictional character i learned from this post that it s based on a true story so i think that makes it a little better
the movie is based on the real experiences of amanda brown if you wanna be pedantic it s her story you are remembering as a women her story is history as a writer her book is an aspect of history and as the author of the book the movie is based on the movie is a part of her history i could keep going you don t need to dig for a reason just enjoy the movie
been a badass who embraces her femininity while succeeding in a male dominated field it s a movie it s for fun don t take it so seriously
well at least one of em was lighthearted and fun
seems like you re the one taking it seriously i posted it on funny lol

as someone married to someone with a low sex drive if this happened to me that would be the fastest discord disconnect in history
who stays up past what are you tommy lee
instructions not clear married but no sex and can t play thanks to being tired all the time
the only thing my wife interrupts my gaming for is to guilt me into getting her something from the fridge even if she s closer
don t do it to your selves boys
i wish my wife demanded sex
a good marriage hey we bangin tn the boyz are lookin to game nah alright cool games or oh yeah for sure im in the mood alright sweet lets knock this out i ll tell them mins
married life without children
what s so bad about a second break
we re trying to have a baby that is my husband s life now
is anyone else kinda annoyed by the way adult men are portrayed as children nowadays i mean damn are there really that many man children out there that this has just become an accepted stereotype
wait until the marital stage where sex now is replaced with c mon only to discover she wants you in bed just so she can have you listen to her scroll tiktok until she falls asleep no sex because reason_of_the_day so you could have just kept playing
welp this hasn t happened for me at all damn kids
wait til you have kids and you ll get a plot twist everyday
his friends are calling him gay as they speak
damn i wish i had this problem
haha must not have kids
i totally relate he always wants to game really annoying
this is unrealistic and i hate it no wife demands sex from their husband smh everyone knows that once you re married there is no sex
my turn to repost this tomorrow
married sex best joke this year
two things first this was posted less than a week ago secondly this was created and shared by someone who clearly isn t married and it shows
married person here it s not like this at all
the joke was shitty the first time it was posted and it s still shitty now xd
in an alternate universe
lol married life sex that s funny
if only
yet they get soooo angry when you slap them on the ass jump up and do the chicken dance talking about new record
these are some of the least funny comics ever every single one sucks and the art style is trash
another comic artist that doesn t really make jokes but just says something about sex in a shitty art style
married yrs this is not happening trust me
a second break will do not harm ig
sick repost
get a hold of some phone in radio shows from american radio programs circa just dudes with great lives kvetching they can t get a blowie from their wives porn has freed you rejoice
man that would be a nice problem
im a redditor i dont get wifes or girlfriends or friends that are girls
oh you changed the watermark
it s worst then that i go brush my teeth and boom she s asleep
the real joke is this comment section lol
best part is he uses a laptop my wife also doesn t like those big clunky things am only allowed a laptop
my wife and daughter are at her parent s place and it has been a nice chance to get some sleep needless to say i have been staying up until am to play
if the genders were reversed this would not be ok
fine let s have sex ugh my life sucks lol i wish i was this guy
but mom
sheeyit all my old lady has to say is hey honey you wa and i m shutting off the pc via the power button and not even closing out the game
i know it s a joke but i hope to never be that girl maybe i am to independent like you want to play games fine i am going to watch the last of us with out you
sex now one of the phrases that are never spoken by wives
person who made that isn t married
repost life
bud can speak for himself later dudes late night snack is always preferred
my woman gives me issue if i wanna bang thr is a good chance she is down if she wants to bank i am alway down if i m gaming she is usually behind me reading or watching me
lolololol she ll be too tired no matter what she says trust me
sex occurs in marriage who knew
this is the most inaccurate thing i ve seen on reddit thus far in
he s married he s not getting sex
everyone is saying that women don t do this but my wives do i was just casually doing something then doesn t matter it s bed time
you don t say this in real life trust me
you are definitely not married boy thats not how mariage works
unrealistic
women don t want sex the fuck kind of black magic shitposting is this
hah i wish
how sad
was this found in the fiction section
haha this really had me loling
this is awful
cringe
would you find this funny if the person gaming was a woman and the one demanding sex was a man i don t see how these jokes are only appropriate when it s a woman abusing a man
pretty much spot on even though more with subtle hints than direct commands even the time fits after pm it s not happening we re on the verge of passing out
cringe af
ftfy https://prnt.sc/0wkle32nlusw)

gilligan
lt dan that s ma boat nice work gump
helped a friend move his wooden power boat outside of marina del rey ca he tried to position the boat to anchor he got so close to the beach the waves were breaking under the bow the forward keel was bouncing off the sand between waves people on the beach were waving flashlights at us the life guard truck was doing over down the beach to get there and had their lights flashing and yelling over the pa system the owner captain kept asking me where the harbor master had told him where to anchor at i then realized he was deafer than i realized had night blindness needed new glasses at least he demanded me to tell him where they want us after i tried several times i finally stood at attention saluted him and said captain sir they want us in the ocean sir he was furious but i think he realized i can swim like a fish and was about to jump overboard and swim to the beach the only reason i did not is because all alone he is going to beach it run it on the rocks or crash into somebody elses boat the next day he almost hit the coast guard boats tied to their docks in channel islands harbor as he performed a degree turn that went to around degrees i was on the top of the boarding ladder when he did that
nobody can say you re a listless captain

sorry skipper
lt dan helped me dock i wanted to show him my boat
my thoughts too he looks a robert shaw stunt double
that s what i was thinking
i think it might be a relationship i hear they can be fragile and one sided
the howels ginger the professor and mary ann really looks like the area around that deserted isle has built up a lot since then
not ai just me when i returned home after those days my mom was here and i told her all that happened she said you sure spin a good yarn and left the room my nose is still bent not from mom but from jumping off the boarding ladder when i was dead tired fell asleep mid air and awoke when my feet hit the dock i caught myself in a flying pushup but broke my nose and bashed my head on the concrete guest dock watching the boat drift towards the footer in front of us i did manage to catch the last foot of the stern line and pulled the boat back to tie it off ran the feet to the bow line back to the stern for a spring line then up the boarding ladder thru the main salon and out the pilot house door then down the engine room to put out the shore power cable up the ladder across the pilot house down the boarding ladder only to plug the cable in and have the breaker blow as i had forgotten to flip to shore power back to the engine room to flip the transfer switch back to the dock to plug it in now up to the top deck for the water hose and a second 30amp shore power cord i was exhausted

this is what happens when you spend a good portion of your life being sean penn he s worn himself out on being himself
never go full shemp
the taxidermist did a great job tho
he looks like he should sound like elmer fudd be vewy vewy qwiet i m hunting wabbit
didn t know adults get fetal alcohol syndrome
oh a wise guy huh
he looked like larry in carlito s way
all that narcissism is a real burden
he looks like 1st generation midjourney rendering
some people just don t age well
the shemp edition too much hair for curly or curly joe
da fg happened to him
sun dried penn
damn spicoli lookin rough
drugs not even once
tbf moe shemp and curly were brothers so they all resembled each other anyway but i definitely see a strong larry influence though
fuck sean penn
tweety bird when he took dr hyde s formula came to mind https://youtu.be/v5k69zr1u_i
unfortunately i really don t care for this communist bastard
kinda looks like andrew garfield wearing an old man mask
ears are huge on this guy
looks like a composite photo of stallone deniro and barney
i watched a documentary about him and kate del castillo meeting el chapo he was a total douche bag about the whole thing he tried to make it a whole hollywood production and chapo wasn t having any of it
when your outsides look like the person you are inside a stooge in fact
dudes got up syndrome
life imitating the art of being a giant piece of shit
i was annoyed at the jab at a great actor then i remembered what he did to madonna and i was ah yeah he s more than fair game to make fun of
i m not sure sean penn could tell you who sean penn is at this point he s done so many 180s in his life but for me he ll always be the one who beat the living daylights out of madonna and no matter how glitchy she is no one deserved that
idk i d say i see shemp in there too
arent there like or stooges
must be talking about post curly
weren t there like stooges but were brothers
aww wise guy eh
this comment section is gold
nyuck nyuck nyuck
my brain may be broken on this one but wasn t there a time where he wanted to make a movie about the stooges
he looks like a year old grandmother after a night of drinking sherry
if shemp and moe had a crack baby
at least he s not doing plastic surgery like simon cowell
nyuk nyuk nyuk
he is
he is all stooges look at his history
i know reddit hates him lies about madonna forth coming in the comments but he really is a great actor maybe he is like justine bateman and just doesn t give a shit about aging but yeah decades of smoking and alcohol drugs are not kind on your looks as you age
fuck yall he s years old he doesn t have to look like he did in 80s movies
man oh man he aged bad
making fun of people for how they look is not funny is childish who ever posted this grow up
snitch9 number
you forgot shemp
mmmmmkaaayyyy
but not funny at all
still better looking than his ex wife madonna nowadays
he s years old he looks fine for his age
this is nothing short of hilarious he wasn t a looker to start with but father time apparently didn t give him any breaks and beat the absolute shit outta him on a somewhat related sidenote i recently saw what justine bateman looks like today she was pretty cute in the 80s now geezus i thought it was photoshopped poor thing
removed
got them post divorce megamind vibes going on
he should do a movie with that guy who likes all the impractical jokers put together
hahahahah

i m not seeing curly at all
whut thuh hail happunt ta my lyfe some guy
plus actor
wow he is not aging well
and microwaved on high for minutes
mystic river blew us away
now i know why giving his oscar to ukraine was so important to him he sold his soul for that and can keep his looks if he s near to it the farther and longer it is away to him the more he melts
he looks like a real life muppet
the crowning achievement of his career will always be fast times at ridgemont high https://youtu.be/sw1s4f9tyf8?t=12)'^^youtube
is that b f bugelberry did he ever make it out of hell after the christmas special

don t let him try to change a lightbulb
and high af
ooooof lookin like an adult garbage pail kid
tbh this fellow looks like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders
which
holy hell sean looks like he was shot out of a cannon
he looks like the business end of a toilet brush
ah a wise guy eh
the one stooge
i resembled riff raff from rocky horror picture show being called out on it and saying he s the one who saved everyone
the trinity in the name of the moe the curly and the larry
nailed it
woowoowooowoowooooowoo nyuk nyuk
it s like his face is madonna s version of dorian gray s painting
i ve always liked sean penn i hope he really doesn t look like that

the see you next tuesday thing as a way to spell cunt is so stupid the first two letters are homonyms of the letters they represent while the second two start with the same letter it s inconsistent use one or the other if you want to spell it how about something like see you in tijuana granted the in is a bit of a stretch but you get something that sounds like c u n t but if you want to have a phrase that starts with the same letters and maybe the same sentiment you could say something like catch up next tuesday again a clear c u n t is spelled out there i didn t put much thought into these acronym type phrases but they make a hell of a lot more sense than see you next tuesday i don t know who came up with that but they couldn t understand neologistic terms
i d add tarded to the bottom
every time i see this shirt all i think of is rethink buying this shirt
what are we again lame

don t touch me you asshole
the lack of retaliation concerns me she either has the nicest cat or she s screwed later
that would ruin my whole day what if my cat thought i did it on purpose
my cat went the whole way inside a cabinet and i shut her inside for a straight hour i heard quiet meowing and didn t know where it was coming from
i feel her trying to apologize to the cat even though she can t speak in meow
me owww
honorary r oneorangebraincell
yeap she is well and truly done for i remember closing the door a little to fast after my cat entered and spooked him he managed to trip me up that night and nearly killed me i repeat i did not even close the door on him i wasn t conscious enough to realise i should have waited five more seconds to not scare him
that cat is going to get its revenge at 3am
you do realise i m shitting on your bed now right
that cat is pissed
who set up a camera to capture part of the fridge and a couple of cabinets
curiosity bonked the cat
i m actually worried cat skulls are not robust
i hate you now
this is what you get when you need to stuff yourself into every immediately available space you encounter unless of course it s a cat carrier
am only one who shouted nooooooo
that cat was like naw fuck you that was my head bro lmao
lives remains
cat so you re chosen death
i always feel so bad tho
kitty felt that from head to tail
curiosity caused the concussion
awww poor pussycat
become an enemy
why do so many videos these days exist of people just doing ordinary things in their homes i for example am not filming myself at the moment lying on the couch looking at my phone
it s ok that one brain cell is safe in that thick noggin
why is the sound so funny to me
i let you live in my house cook for me and this is how you repay me
yeah right lack of retaliation when the woman tried to apologize that poor thing s body language clearly said dont touch me probably followed by a filthy hominid i was going to spare you in the upcoming uprising now i m having your head on a pike
we had ours enter a small closet just before we shut it we went for a 3h hike took about 10min to find her after she got out quickly when we finally opened the door as we were too slow to close it in the next 10sec she was right bk in there
our cat got caught between the screen door and back door there is like a inch gap but for like the seconds she was smooshed taught that prick not to try and run out the door though
you understand cats

the whisky in a syrup bottle trick i do the same at work
plot twist it s brown gravy
that reminded me of the story of some girl that started going to the gym and didn t read or asked but instead imitated what she saw and instead of pre workout she was drinking nesquik
is there a joke hidden in here somewhere

why would it be considered clever
plot twist its diarrhea
with whisky
yes sir on aisle behind the beans and cornbread
yeah can t you sense it

because using a bottle to put water in it is such a brilliant idea until now i was putting water in my pocket but it kept leaking from my pants that was so annoying

i keep my water in the sky not very easy to get it back but it is possible to store an enormous amount of it


ii
iii
but with a fork progress
i love a happy ending plus that takeout looks awesome
because that s what heroes do
blurry eyes full stomachs can t lose
what a journey truly inspiring
i have a cousin who got butt diddled at a party after he passed out or so he says
sad part this was me last week i can relate
shit that s beautiful
a friend sent this to me and i was in shock the guy look just like me hahaha i was thinking who recorded me when how why is it in english brazilian here
you sir have inspired me to become the alcoholic i always knew i could be to lose all inhibitions and have no recollection of it the next day to reach new heights of liver damage and become the toxic person i never thought i could be thank you never stop inspiring
he faded into darkness
than not then
it actually doesn t look like he s forcing the junk food
welcome to the uk where being a piss head or borderline alcoholic is seen as a substitute for a personality
than ffs
still chewing with your mouth open nothings changed
drunk or no chew with your mouth closed you animal
he needs to learn to chew with his mouth closed
you only live once and as long you have fun why not from the moment you realise that its not worth it then you have the rest of your life to live like you want
best thing on reddit this morning what a legend
anyone that eats like that should get smacked close your mouth when you chew
he s so brave
sad really
whenever i drink no matter how much i still remember everything that happened and i have amazing envioremental awareness i can stand but i m a bit wobbly at that part i basically function like myself just more wobbly than i usually am edit don t mind my username alcohol just feels great
it s funny but not ha ha funny
loved this than
gross no one wants to see all your half chewed food i guess the manners went out the window when the alcohol took over
never give up
im inspired no matter what i will do the same
fuck ya living his best life
no one likes a quitter nice job lol
beautiful
so brave so inspirational i told my wife about this man she hit me with her handbag
go you good thing
hammered drunk street vendor food before heading home is a vibe
consistency
you look so happy plus i already know that junk food hits the spot when you re drunk like that
god bless you
stay on target
not gonna lie you had me in the first half and the second half
definitely stoned in the days ago clip
write your own story
only this time i don t know how i got here can someone please tell me
he looks like a dude just trying to enjoy his life
chew with your mouth closed jesus
is that explosions or saltillo
ahhh the twenty something years
congrats champ
than
he looks like jason sudekis
livin like larry
what movie is this song from
to anyone curious about the song the mighty rio grande earth to echo soundtrack https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=497ncdzpbbi if you haven t seen the movie earth to echo it s a really good movie super emotional the ending song one that s playing here and one i gave the link to makes me cry like every time it s just so emotional and i love it wonderful movie and i highly recommend it for anyone that hasn t watched it yes it s technically a kids family movie but there is quite a bit of action and it s just really well done what more can i say
more then really
where is that song from
is that explosions in the sky
fucking hilarious
a story of true perseverance
saw it coming but made me smile tho
he successfully eaten food
glad to see chris archie having a blast happy birthday bud
the hardest part is staying consistent
only gross thing about this is chewing with your damn mouth open
find something you love it won t be like work
at least you re a happy drunk
but look how happy he is
a damn legend
close ya mouth when you chew you re a damn grown up
people that chew with their mouth open no matter how drunk they are disgust me
my man living his best life
and a smile
sheds tear as camera pans out with violins playing in the background
oh no the diddler is on the loose again someone send up the bat signal
my friends that don t drink say i m a bit of a dick and not pleasant to be around when i m drunk i thought they were just bitches but it s literally everybody how is it possible that all my friends are bitches nerds laughsinsadsober
currently staying here and i am struggling to find any redeeming qualities the food is absolutely awful the main things people seem to do for fun is get pissed the only people who look healthy are years olds because apparently by the time you are mid twenties in the uk you have downed so much atrocious food and alcohol you have turned yourself into a sickly mishapen blob i have travelled around a lot rich and poor countries and most places have some multiple aspects that are enjoyable the uk seems to be consistently terrible on almost every front it s like the country as a whole has just given up
i m always surprised at the jokes and convos normalising and celebrating binge drinking on uk panel shows like jon richardson saying he has a dedicated room in his house to get drunk in or josh widdicome getting black out drunk after an awards show that s just alcoholism guys it s really sad
the first one was beautiful then he moved on to the success story gosh learn to read
he s drunk as a skunk
tell me you have never been black out drunk at am eating whatever the first thing is on your way and it being the most tasty thing in the world for the duration of the devour without telling me
screw that ill eat how i want and you can keep your fancy manners to yourself
you re a bundle of laughs
that just tells me you haven t drank enough or you are a puker not that either of those are bad things
it s british funny
moneyball https://youtu.be/mv6yehvxrje
not to be confused with the butt signal which might summon that ol diddler again
see the comma there it makes a difference doesn t it
yeah
must be nice not living with misophonia he didn t even have the chewing sounds in the video and i can fecking hear his lips smacking plus it looks gross drunk or not chewing with your mouth closed should be second nature make it your habit
that might be too but that means it would take more than a liter of to get me blackout drunk probably way more other ciders and beers i probably started with
misophonia is a you problem but you want to make it everyone else s lmao
probably normally took me about a half gallon when i was a severe alcoholic which is about double a liter not that i suggest it i quit drinking years ago
dam thats a lot also glad to hear you quit heard a lot of people drinking because they feel it lessens their depression just to lead to more problems and a worsened depression

plot twist that was actually a family member and this wasn t a dream
the guy pull a reverse uno on his own nightmare
when i was a kid i had nightmares almost every night and it was usually clowns chasing me i ll never forget the night when i stopped running turned around and choked a clown to death he reached up to try and pull my hands away from his neck and i broke both his wrists haven t had a single nightmare since
when role playing with your gimp goes too far
being a lucid dreamer be like
damn that was a long and accurate spit
the spit at the end was brilliant
man sounds like a minecrafy villager
some of the funniest shit i ve ever seen
odd this happened to me almost exactly like this though i ended up choking it on the stairs and it wasn t physical i leaped out of my body
bro said hell no
hold up he can punch in dreams feels illegal
when the guy got up and started to lay the beat down i was expecting doom music to start playing
can t slay demons in final form
this is a nightmare s worst nightmare
that punch speed and contact is about the same as it would be in a dream nightmare
source https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2ilunbada6u&feature=youtu.be)
why does this remind me of watchmen

this is a reference to the funniest answer ever on i think the newly wed game the question was where is the oddest place you have ever had sex the wife holds up a card with the same answer as tom
brilliant joke
i know i m in the minority here but i like that tom hanks fella
basically apparently
other question your favorite memory from epstein island
have no idea
but yet he couldn t handle ricky gervais jokes
why is that horse talking
you talking about olga
for the longest time bob eubanks swore it never happened https://youtu.be/evtj6d0vvq8), and was only an urban legend
the male brain reaches the adult stage at from there on out we may learn more stuff but we will forever laugh at a fart
big if true
the look he gave at the oscars was not him being upset with ricky gervais s jokes that was a veteran in the industry knowing how his peers are and knowing gervais was up there dropping truth bombs was also look of a person who knows that none of what gervais was saying applied to him and others like him who are in hollywood but exist outside the typical hollywood crowd
how embarrassing for you lol
what the actual fuck
your comment seems a lot more mean than funny did julia roberts take a dump in your bed or murder your parents or something lol
huge even
i guess i misunderstood then it looked like he wasn t enjoying his jokes at all thanks for the correction
thats a fuck ton of speculation asserted as truth redditors man
what is embarrassing
some people don t need any reason to say mean things after all she s absolutely loaded and i m not so i don t think she cares about i think she looks like a female human body with a horse head kind of a minotaur but mixed with a horse i think it s funny and i don t care hoe many woke dislikes i get
yeah those jokes were made for the angelina jolie brad pitt and gweneth patro types that get way too involved in social matters even though they don t understand how of us live our daily lives tom hanks generally stays out of social issues and off social media giving his constant opinions about the way people should live day to day but there s not many like him left in hollywood they all feel they need to speak their minds on things like they will never understand

plot twist it s a sweet shop
and like that kids r us tanks it s ipo
weird toystore
free to feel like this but cannot avoid thinking all child haters must have been sad children themselves
i m reminded of the w c fields line i love children boiled with mustard
people who hate kids are the perfect people to not have kids and in fact i encourage them to remain childless the system works
plenty of places unsuitable for children kinda sad that this sign needs to be made for parents to know where it s not appropriate but i like the cut of the jib on it
this will probably be contentious but i genuinely think people who hate kids this much are more annoying than screaming kids in public kids are going to scream and fuss no matter what the parent does childhood is a process of learning to deal with emotions and finding boundaries they can t control what happening to them and sometimes all a parent can do is there best to alleviate some of that distress but an adult human being should have the maturity to understand why kids cry or scream and should be capable of accepting that it is not possible to live a life where you are never exposed to it people who constantly complain any time there s a loud kid nearby or love to hear themselves talk about how much they hate kids are much much more annoying
had met so many unresponsive parents with annoying kids this makes feel covid s one customer only stores policy made me happy cause i didn t met kids running and crashing into other customers and crying and their parents yelling why don t you watch before crashing to my poor kid
i dislike people in general exeptions excluded but children are the absolute worst i can t stand those loud obnoxious creatures
replace children with women jews mexicans etc remember that all those groups can protect themselves physically and legally and you ll understand how f d up that sign is
r signswithastory
it s definitely not a sweatshop there d be tons of them in the back
an adult themed sweet shop
or the norm for a roald dahl book
dark like uncomfortably dark
i don t disagree but it _is_ his business and if he dislikes them he s as free to not want them at his workplace as much as you are free to not want something you dislike in your house it s not about dealing with a child screaming in a public place that you can t avoid it s likely his business where parents often come with a child around if he doesn t like them his business and his patience owns nobody nothing to have him accomodate other people s children after the fifth time an annoying spoiled brat breaks something and the parent just brushes it off or screams his lungs out while the owner tries to finish the current transaction after the fifth time the same parent brings in the same child even after the owner suggested to him discreetly _not to_ you can also view the sign as simply saving himself the trouble sorry there s a sign no exceptions he doesn t have to justify it to parents anymore and he could even say mgmt will be pissed even if likely it is his business because children caused damages parents never paid for or whatever they can be annoying and proctive with such a sign or they simply are tired of repeating this all over again and having parents push for more just this one time please children are annoying i like them in very tiny amounts and when i don t have to care for them i ve decided i don t want them not only for this reason overpopulation and a few others so if i can t tolerate mine and i don t find a lot of justification for tolerating others children yes they re still gonna scream and not understand emotions and be a nuisance but they re not _my nuisance_ i am allowed to disprove of children in places where peace is expected like during ceremonies in libraries moments of silence in churches in an office sure being pissed at a child screaming in a park is asinine but not wanting children in my house isn t just me not dealing with it i don t have to accomodate you and your children life with them is tougher and while parents usually accomodate eachother i _don t have to_ and i m not an asshole for not doing it it s a favour others grant you and i m not willing to it s not a right i am denying you you can get a babysitter a friend or go to a more expensive place that has a child play area this is the way i see the sign i decided i don t like children i don t want them around and parents still force me to make an exception for them every time
this will probably be contentious but i genuinely think people who hate kids this much are more annoying than screaming kids in public you sound like a reasonable adult this is reddit though full of single men who hold resentment for couples with children and yeah the language and tone of that sign says more about the owner s attitude than anything that s not an atmosphere i would walk into child with me or not
could not agree more there are two things that i will always judge someone harshly on being rude to waitstaff being weirdly aggressive towards annoying children we all can see if a kid is being annoying of the time the parent is waaay more annoyed upset embarrassed with their kid sure there is that terrible parent that doesn t care but most of the time even when the parent doesn t seem like they are caring they are just so burnt out frustrated and beyond it all please don t make a bad situation worse for that guardian of course there are places where kids don t belong but i think that goes without saying in this particular case yes the business owner is allowed to not allow children if they d like however i can almost guarantee this person is more insufferable than the kids that they claim to be annoyed by i say this as a business owner who has to deal with annoying ass kids all day their brains are not developed yet don t be a prick it s easy
of course your viewpoint is not a popular one nevertheless there are those among us who are in agreement
bloody hell some mental gymnastics there
ah yes the rights of children to be present in a store where the owner has to accomodate them especially the free roaming ones without parents you are a true progressive my lad perhaps consider militating for their sexual rights too that age of consent thing is hella discriminatory no jews or mexican adults have restrictions on what s consensual sex surely this is discrimination against a group that can t defend themselves s
just a regular one awful business model
yes must lose custom because of it i think

but you eventually came to the conclusion right
yet if they included a fourth panel that explained everyone would ve been saying that it didn t need the last panel
same
good thing the internet hasn t corrupted you as much as it did the rest of us
looks like he already zipped it up
its the mailman he came in the mail
he saw something in the envelope that made him realize who came was correct
same

finished puzzling out the answer you could say
i only needed the first panel my mind lives in the gutter lol

ah yes nothing more relaxing than sleeping mid day with the lights on and in my turtle neck top whilst someone ties fishing wire around my wrist
r scriptedasiangifs
if that s fake he s an amazing actor initial scare while still half a sleep then relief mad because he got scared shitless and hit the stuffed animal he moves so it moves confusion follows because he s still half asleep because he moves away it follows him and he s back to the initial full blown scare only now he s full awake with adrenaline he tries to come to his senses on the ground only it is now underneath him he tries to escape on the bed and the animal goes flying man has to hold his heart for a second no kidding this was a trip
alli waker
because people go to sleep fully clothed
real or not still funny
you can see the string against the arm of the black sweater at the beginning of the clip pranker tied a string to his victim s left hand our right woke them up and filmed the ensuing chaos
i m confused as fuck i thought it was just one of those life sized stuffed animals but it jumped at him
this way can kill sleepiness
cat cucumber
that was pretty entertaining
this is amazing what the hell was that
i dropped my phone when it moved
poor guy it is bad enough he has to sleep with socks on but to endure this prank
funny asian video usually means staged
fake
normal day in australia
haters will say it s fake everyone else will also say it s fake
well that s just mean but hilarious
scripted but epic
homie sleeping with the lights on while fully clothed i call shenanigans
made me jump
staged but still funny
more like r traumatized
right asleep with all the lights on fully dressed in day clothes too
don t play the video you can see the string tied to his hand
that has divorce written all over it
that s just mean he cried what if he has a fear of lizards or something
cake fhinese video
lmao didn t expect it to be tied to him
ruth gator ginsberg
if that were a real gator he d never sleep like that through the alligator breath
that reminds me of the roach meme from way back
wonderful
what a mean way to wake anyone up
i believe the one with the snake but this one same guy twice
spider croco
that double wammy n
this is the joke
just like cats and cucumbers
r scriptedasianpranks
yo that went from zero to real fast
oh hell that made me laugh so much thanks
on good hilarious
seems legit
i audibly screamed
man trying to fight for his life
looks like a not staged sleep to me
hilarious reaction
that s just evil
tictoc tic toc
my soul literally left my body
yup there is a string tied to his hand
yep the old stuffed alligator tied to your wrist trick won t fall for that a third time
what am i missing what made it move strings nah blood lust
the script the script made it move
deleted
i ve done it don t judge me
i slept with clothing sunshine out in the open at a concert for about hours straight
i put a hotel small garbage bag full of water over someones arm while they slept was trying to see if the warm water makes you pee was true and i didn t have a bowl he turned over when i was trying to tie up the water bag and dumped it all over himself and the bed he never woke up until the next morning and he thought he sweat through his clothes and sheets lmao all i m saying is it s possible
the light could originally be off and was turned after in my experience i would not notice until after a while
a nap
lmao i sleep like a rock when i have pms fatigue
as long as i don t turn the lights off i m not napping i m just resting my eyes
prime r funny material
and is then deathly frightened of an obvious stuffed animal there is nothing real or funny about any of this
don t forget the very real and convincing possibility that a giant stuffed animal has come to life is lying in your bed and ready to feed on you for sustenance
it s a chinese dude they sleep in all sorts of positions and time of the day
hell i ve managed to dry shave my roommate s calf while he slept mid day you can get away with a lot depending on circumstances
i ve slept through earthquakes and hurricanes this isn t hard to pull off if person in question is in deep sleep
i thought this had died out apparently not
what da hail
if that s fake he s an amazing actor just wow the fact that there are people that actually believe this is real is absolutely amazing to me
you ever had a nap on your bed clothed i have but i do question the legitimacy of the vid still
yuki tsudona
ye i sleep fully clothed when it s cold pants socks shirt the whole thing
yes
i do even more often than in underwear or naked
with the lights on
you re telling me you ve never gotten too high drunk on the couch and stumbled up to bed fully clothed come on lol
yes
asian staged gif
i actually do it is more convenient
in a turtle neck no less
they don t
you don t
i always do
yea very often like it s baffling that people think that is odd
do you undress to take a nap outside or elsewhere from home or to take a nap period at all
with the quilt nicely cornered and you wake up immediately when you hear a voice
what are you trying to say
i got home from work yesterday sat on the edge of my bed to change shoes to mow woke up hours later with one shoe and a cat on my chest
yeah except socks
it s neither real nor funny though in fact it s not funny precisely because it s not candid this might be funny to a year old but otherwise it s stupid as hell when you realize he s just acting in no way is that funny this is scripted an funny https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/12cfwl1/dont_give_granny_the_psvr/) the difference is that one is not only genuinely funny but they re not trying to suggest it was a real event and that anyone was actually frightened the only way a candid video is funny is if the people are actually frightened otherwise it s cringe as hell
string tied to wrist it s a brilliant prank if it s real
no fucking way
nap during the day
most shit statement i have ever heard first it s easy to sleep with the lights on or the guy filming just opened the lights second what s wrong with sleeping in day clothes or whatever i just go to sleep with whatever i was wearing last without changing into pajamas and what not

crap ton of axles on that rig
i ve seen stickers and mudflaps that say passing side and suicide funny but take heed people that thing that you can t wait to get around and then brake in front of is basically a small building and it will absolutely smash you flat a good truck driver can definitely see farther ahead knows where they re going and wants nothing more than to drive smoothly through traffic it s people trying to win in traffic that cause the problems
two extra axles plus an additional drop axle how heavy is this hay
i love it when actual drivers notice the real story
it many tires
e p i c
that person will kill you with that truck and laugh
when i ve seen drivers pass trucks on the right its because they re not keeping toward the right lane
i bet it s probably not that heavy relatively speaking it s just that a lot of states have very restrictive limits on axle weights and bogie spread
i think his rig has lbs on it so thats pretty damn heavy

hello xxxxxxxx we have had to have this talk with him before i will make sure to correct this with proper punishment thanks jack mhoff
unironically in social studies class in my 11th grade we had to pair up in groups and have debates and one of the groups named themselves the same thing and everyone laughed including the teacher and it was their name for the entire event the only real lesson i can think to be learned here would be learning that there s a proper time and place for jokes and public decency but i think at surrounded by year olds this doesn t fully apply but it s still a good idea to be considerate to those around you a detention does sound a bit extreme though unless it was already made clear that these kind of jokes weren t tolerated in this class
i used to ask for suspension instead of detention especially if they gave saturday school if you missed it twice you got suspended for days i used to show up late for first hour times a week and get hour saturday school then do it the following week hour would become i d you didn t show up you would get suspended the vp one time complained i was using the rules to get free days off i told him he should have better policies i got two hours of saturday school for being an ass i told him he should probably just make that another day suspension
hah oh right ahem
it s better than anita dick
i d reply playing dumb and make them explain it because i don t understand
this is worth a detention why not make him change it and tell him not to do it again because he d then get a detention for not respecting his teacher
as a non english talker i was like what is going on here why i don t understand this and then i said it out loud and was like ohh

one of my high school students tricked me into saying the name ice wallacum out loud yesterday
in middle school nearly years ago our pe teacher s name was mr bateman one kid chris a started calling him master bateman and got the whole class doing it he went along and thought it was funny for a day then he figured out why we always laughed uncontrollably while saying it and gave chris detention i think about this often
when i was i was sent to face the wall because we were asked to name different types of paper and i put up my hand and said toilet paper i was so confused at what i had done wrong
our daughter is we told her basically as soon as she could talk we don t care what words she uses we care about her intent eg if she says fuck these fries are delicious then we re good if she tells us to go fuck ourselves we re gonna have a problem but we told her there s a very big caveat it s important she knows her audience and that there are lots of places where said language won t fly and we won t go to bat for her for example at school if she gets caught using words that the school isn t ok with it hasn t happened yet but there s time
should have gone with master debater to make it less obvious amateur
there s a phd in science who has the name of mark t butter so went he writes a paper it s m t butts

jonathan swift s gulliver s travels published in has a character named master bates your son is in fine company

my daughter was recently suspended for trying to help settle down an unruly class by asking them to kindly shut the fuck up i took her to chipotle and pinkberry
he s just debating bro
you made this email yourself
thank you for bringing this to my attention i ll be sure to sit him down and have a talk about being hilarious around people without a sense of humor
your son is awesome completely age appropriate i once beat the local pound burger challenge and they took my polaroid and let me sign it i wrote i beat the meat they took it down within a week
this sounds similar to what my brother did in middle school or at least spawned a conversation similar to what my mom had to have with my brother lol he changed a sign from math club to meth club the teacher called my mom as we were in a craft store to report on how horrible my brother s behavior was by doing that i didn t hear the teacher s side but i heard my mom very obviously trying to contain her laughter and failing while his teacher was telling her how unacceptable this incident was i don t think the teacher expected mom s response and was highly offended lol the conversation very much ended up being that was funny but keep the drug jokes at home our family has a very dry dark sense of humor very religious and would never dream of doing any kind of drug that wasn t prescribed in the way it s intended but we joke about it all the time along with other politically incorrect subjects
i remember walking in class in the fifth year at a uk school and seeing just the teacher and a friend sitting at his desk his name is was martin bates i shouted over and said eh master bates he laughed the teacher gave me detention for a week and a letter to my parents they both laughed when read it and then complained to the school about the teacher being petty
my son and his band the sofa kings won the talent show and received a cash prize at a private religious high school two weeks later the administration made them pay back the prize money
me hahaha ok do you know what you did wrong child i said something inappropriate me what no you lacked subtlety like name a team the cause be sweaters child what me you have to do something that people don t catch right away child so your telling me not to get caught me exactly but if you do get caught you gotta make sure enough time has passed that everyone is afraid to embarrass themselves child that s something to think about
well did he win
sorry about that i ll talk to him about it thanks for letting me know hugh janus
so i don t get it what did he do wrong then when they explain accuse them of being a pervert and exposing your innocent son to the lewd innuendo to which he stumbled we do a little gaslighting around here
wow that is absurd
i d be the kid declaring myself the vibe rater
i ll never forget the time i drew a bunch of penises in my mates maths book the teacher turned them all into smiley faces and i had to sit with him for minutes of my lunch lol
im going to be seriously pissed if a teacher wastes all of our time like that
what an uptight teacher
8th grade science teacher here i was playing a kahoot review game with a class last year and had a kid name himself ice wall locum which looked like nonsense until i said it out loud no detention but we had a talk about classroom appropriate humor
ok thanks for letting me know sincerely pat magroin
adults don t have to punish cleverness at a fifth grade graduation ceremony for my son s class one kid wrote a song to play on piano at the ceremony he called it another piece of sheet music there were chuckles but no detention this teacher overreacted
my older brother this was in the 80s told me once he got suspended when they gave him hours to research whatever he wanted on a computer he spent his whole hours looking up what cunnilingus was and saved it to a floppy disk he eventually wrote a report that was approved by his teacher and presented it to the class after his presentation he was escorted to the principal office and suspended for doing a report on a vulgar subject when he went back they told him he received an a on his report and never to do that again

sadly enough i was the first person in the history of years of my catholic school being open to get in school suspension for bringing a whoopie cushion to class apparently jesus doesn t let farters into heaven

this may not translate across language barrier but i ll try in malay we call east india company as syarikat hindia timur inggeris or shti as you may predict its a lot more interesting to call it shit and as you may also predict teenagers either being goofy or a smart ass why not both decided to make a school project presentation using shit as the chosen acronym the history teacher is also the school s discipline teacher budddy of mine got a parental warning they called the parents in because he wouldnt stop after the 2nd warning here s the kicker buddy of mine got used to the shit and shit all over the national level examination essays for the history paper he got b or c i cant remember

bless that man instead of shoving it off or ignoring it he helps the cat kind person there
cat got off just at the right time
i was hoping for a mrow right down the mic
i deeply admire that guy s concentration he flinches just a little when the cat turns its butt to his face who wouldn t but he never drops a beat
his voice is lovely he doesn t miss a beat when the cat jumps off
cats like i got this playa
i like to imagine this is a routine lil guy even knew to jump right before the bow
this guy s a pro
well done that man
i m a christian but hes a good man of god he just showed his patience and love for one of gods creatures god bless you
is that cat stevens
i respect this man
r catsaremuslim
cat hey the egyptians used to worship me convince everyone here to switch to cat gods do it or i boop you
that man s disciple is insane
bro is trying his hardest not to smile
cat open a can of food now not after prayers now
cat must ve thought it was a zoom meeting
cat don t care about religion or race they annoy everyone and everyone just bear with them
i am an arab egyptian i love cats a lot i don t worship them in most mosques in arab countries and most muslims countries they let cats inside the mosque and no one really care that much most arab as far as i know love cats a lot i personally love cats as well the imam the guy who is reciting quran is an arab not turkish also he is reciting quran the holy book of muslims if someone curious about what the recitation says those who give partners to allah will say if allah had wished we should not have given partners to him nor would our fathers nor should we have had any taboos so did their ancestors argue falsely until they tasted of our wrath say have ye any certain knowledge if so produce it before us ye follow nothing but conjecture ye do nothing but lie say with allah is the argument that reaches home if it had been his will he could indeed have guided you all
was so hoping it would meow into the mic lmao
i shall not be tempted by cuteness i shall not be tempted by cuteness
that s how serious that stuff is being raised a catholic if a cat jumped on the priest the whole place would have fell out
cats like singing not sure why my russian blue comes running any time anyone sings
him inwardly thinking i have trained for this
that man s voice is on point dude is a pro
thanks to internet it seems to me a large number of mosques no matter which country it is has their own cats the mosque i go to pray has one as well weeks ago she even gave birth to kitties saying in advance both mom and kitties are well as far as i know
hey i know you re currently trying to save your soul and whatnot but i m just gonna drag my asshole across your face real fast
no one noticed lol
this is wholesome af
this is beautiful
must be really hingry after all that fasting
ok so i am not muslim and all i know about the religions feelings about cats is what i read on wikipedia that being said i own cats and they are wonderful what i like about this video is that the cat jumped up on the priest is that the cat wanted to be a part of things because cats mirror the activity of those that they are close too and once on his shoulders just leans in supportively gives a snuggles it s super cute and i love it
this man knows his business keeps up a class act and pets the little guy
i have a cat who does that exact behavior to me and he handled it much more calmly than i usually do bless him for his focus patience and kindness
impeccable timing
my mother in law has to deal with our cat when she does her prayers we try to lock the cat up when it comes time for her to pray our kitten like this one loves to jump on shoulders and ride around she did this as a kitten but has tripled in size in like months and doesn t realize she doesn t quite fit anymore but she insists
this is the 2nd video this morning i ve seen of this kitty wanting to be loved on adorable levels over a billion
cat i am fond of you please check out my butthole as a sign of my affection
this would be the norm in turkey they freaking love cats
man why cat because no one will ever believe you jumps off
meowslim
pretty sure allah just visited this mans
i really wanted kitty to yowl into that mic
imma put mah cat on da mic
your praying to god oh well i m here meow man what do you need peasant
cats are just the best when they wanna be
the cats like you i like you it s literally never steered me wrong
the cat s got something to say let him have the mic after prayer
is he using a digital delay or is that the rooms natural echo
miau maiu
i respect the discipline
he just casually petting it nothing to see here
hang in there bismillah
don t know that this belongs under funny but it was interesting to some degree
i love how he just keeps going without missing a beat and even gives the cat a few pets in the process
nice i like how poised he was during that interaction
my cat won t even sit in my lap feelsbad
hahah that cat new exactly what he was doing
marking his imam
good thing he didn t yeet the cat like a certain twitch streamer respect
proof that whatever god you believe in has a sense of humor
cat dad dad dad cat dad allah
wow he is a pro kept his composure and didnt forget the next ayah wow cat is a fitna ofcourse
cats like you rang
dedication
you can see the moment the cat nearly breaks his concentration but he pulled through like a champ
he did well to keep a straight face especially when it looked like the cat was going to join in on the microphone
r catsaremuslim
cats sense auras
it is allah informing the man that he is loved
cat jumping on me is literally what i pray for
the ultimate test of self discipline
less about the holiness of the animal and more about its perceived cleanliness
so cute
nawww
floof just wanted his solo
there s no keyboard to fuck with at this job
that would be an answer to prayer to me precious animals that i rejected for far too long
i think god loves him
you know cats dont give a damn
dude passes the vibe check
el gato
i think he wanted a cracker
sweet

r shouldercats
that was awesome what a chad
that cat wanted to pray too
since then he became a catholic
leading the purr ayer
amazing singing i live near a mosque and i often hear the songs during prayer and it s always mesmerising
cats getting in on the prayer since forever
the fact he helped to support the cat when it jumped up is actually really wholesome
that little face rub in the middle of the cat being on his shoulder means that the cat knows him and likes him the fact that he lets him climb and actually helps him do so also means that he knows the cat and appreciates him that is a friendship right there _
if you abuse an animal you ll go directly to hell and it s guaranteed if you help an animal or saving him from hunger or thirst and for better more giving them shelters you ll have a huuuuge change to reach paradise i mean entering heaven without judgment imagine that because it s all about praising allah and his creation i mean if you plant a tree its shadows will be your witness he knows that you have a cleansed soul             ps iran irak isis terrorisme have nothing to do with us muslims they re lunatics you can find them everywhere islam is much bigger than those psychopaths and peasants read more ahadith islam and kindness to animals
i can tell i d definitely disagree with this man on a lot of things but i would still say i love him for who he obviously is at the core of his being

aerial dogfighting
sidewoofer missle
ah to be brave enough to fuck with a german shepherd
bork bombs ready
he s in heat seeking missile
that s ruff buddy
diploying d dog
bone seeking missile
i am become doggo destroyer of worlds
i would rather get hit by a heel fire missile rather than a german shepherd i should now i got gsd a home and got biten a few times
treatos guided munition
modern technology is reaching new levels now we have real life weapon skins
treat seeking missile
this must be part of the war on drugs i always heard about as a child
does it shoot bees when it barks
this is also animal abuse i hope the poor dog is o k who ever has done that i hope they are disciplined for it
wonder if they let you paint the heads of the missiles as furry heads the owo missiles
tommyhawk missile
you re fired arnold
no
i m guessing anti tank lol
is that an f16
good boy i ve got a good boy firing
the shit i gotta go through for a couple bowls of kibble
the pilot is blind and that s his seeing eye dog you know for blind dogfights also do you know when a blind skydiver knows when to open the parachute when the leash is no longer taut
is this the glsdb people keep talking about
dog bullet lol
is that komisar rex

live ammunition
upvote take it
meat seeker missile
by comparison how many times have you been hit by the hellfire missile youre not in a good place to judge youve had enough to build up a decent sample size or the heel fire if that wasnt a typo
it s a sling harness that dogs ride in when they jump out of planes calm down more than just a little
i think we ve all taken a bit of heel fire every now and then might prefer to take my chances with the dog he ll get over it faster
hellfire will be a quick death gsd bite will hurt for a long time
o k i am an dog owner did not know think about dogs jumping out of air planes so this is a working dog that helps people how
the military including special forces have working dogs too they fulfill some of the same roles police k9s do just less protect and serve and more ass kicking and locating land mines
thank you for that information i did know that dogs served in the military also heard that when they are retired and ready for civilian life they get to go live with their handler
are they sure that isn t kathryn hahn s
gen z will never know the cultural significance of this

that s a belgian malinois
pretty sure that s a malinois not a german shepherd but super cute
this is the only reason i want people filming at the gym
more importantly why does this guy have barbells set up
only a belgian could get that enthusiastic about what its owner is doing
my dogs lick their assholes while i work out so there s that
the dog is obv going for tone not bulk
the dog got better depth on the squat
thats cute but dont bring your dog to the gym please
unleashed dog in the gym working out in a snow jacket this video is weird as fuck
is that a service dog or can you bring any old pet to the gym what about allergies
that s the dog s owner
if you take an animal into the gym you are an ass
oh it s leg day
not a german shepherd see belgian malinois
the owner of the dog trains them professionally check out covert canine on ig for some of his work and the original of this video
this one needs to ride a pawloton
the dog s squat depth is better than this guy s
belgian malinois
r animalsbeingbros
malinois are different
belgian malinois

i didn t realize you could bring a kangaroo into a gym lol
now i m curious what a dog bodybuilder might look like
dude get a spotter
that not a german shepard it s a kangaroo
not sure if the dog is doing that to support its owner or just to mock him
how does a human parent an animal
not even close to deep enough also why two bars literally trapping you
that person is a dog s parent what kind of parent keeps their child naked on a leach
that is not german shepard that is belgian malinois
that s a meth shepherd not a german shepherd
that looks more like a malinios not a german shepard
with its human parent give me a break it s a dog it has owners
mate i think you got a kangaroo
malinois i m not surprised
nice form doggie
why is the dude working out wearing what appears to be a camo hunting jacket
that s a weird ass looking kangaroo
doggo was cool but why do some guys do this at the gym you hog the bar make it completely unsafe for yourself use the same bar don t hog it all
that s kind of demeaning to actual parents to call a dog owner a parent
who the fuck takes their dog to the gym
why are dogs allow im a gym never seen that before
dogs are the best we don t deserve them
why is its lead around its head and why is it in the gym
okay who the fuck brings their malinois into the fucking gym with the leash not connected to anything just so you can look alpha while you squat 135lbs barely hitting depth with a barbell behind you
the dog is telling him he needs to get the hip crease below the knee
bench malinois
dog is even showing the human how to do a full rep by going below parallel
looks like a belgian malinois
just a friendly reminder that belgian malinois are not pets and you should not buy one to be a pet
human parent jfc

that s not his parent it s his owner he didn t fuck a dog to create that
pet skills
