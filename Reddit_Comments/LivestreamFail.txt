easiest drama farm possible
it blows my mind how something as innocent sounding as gta rp is filled with drama and toxicity my friend ran a decent sized rp server and sold his share for low figures because he couldn t be fucked dealing with all the drama despite the hundreds of hours he put into creating it
wait this guy isn t fat at all i ve been giving him my money with the expectation that he s been using it for rotisserie chicken s over the sink wtf
penta looks to have lost a lot of weight since last time i watched rp a year or so ago
who would have thought that someone that has been constantly and repeatedly toxic towards other people live on stream turns up to be a piece of shit irl
one thing i haven t yet seen anyone post about rated s long tolerated on server behaviour is chase clouter died for this
i love that penta and many other rpers got their vindication with this incident for years i watched rated bully many streamers including penta and his toxic behavior was excused and ignored its so funny how karma has hit with this he never felt any kind of empathy for those he harassed and abused or how his community did as well cg and the staff of no pixel also need to be held accountable because they turned the blind eye or the members in that crew that followed along being toxic and treating others horribly on that server too i m glad this all came to the surface and it shown a light on the abuse that happens with the common denominator gang of that server in the forefront of toxic behavior yet again it is a pattern that will end up showing how vile that gang can be if you are lucky you ll watch all your enemies fall
rated isn t the only pos that treats people badly from cg though tbf
i miss chase clouter
i dont really know about this drama but did penta get a haircut or something he s looking pretty good
all that penta vs rated cg drama penta being called the worse and accused of being disrespectful to women in his rp character by cg must be nice that all along it was the ones shouting that really were the bad ones
penta said someone named sapien who i believe is a gtarp streamer is ripping rated apart on twitter no idea who they are though
you gotta remember that penta has rped in the same server as rated for years and existed in the same community i d imagine he s heard all kind of gossip from other players imagine getting whispers for years from friends and other players saying this guy did this and this help me and all you can say is sorry to hear i know but i can t do anything to help
man s giddy that rated finally got permanently banned they hated each other
im out of the loop what happened
wow penta look thin and strong
rated was such a nice guy to everyone until this very moment nobody could have seen it coming and he belongs ed to such a swell group too surprised pikachu with gold foil
i want to fuck penta
yeah because penta is an example of a good person
rp drama omegalul
holy shit this guy is hot i ve never seen him in my life i have no idea who he is real
by that logic if something comes out of penta being weird it wouldn t be a surprise
i love rp
how ironic coming from this guy
ironic
deleted
i love penta but i feel like most of the top rpers treat everyone not in their circle like theyre just npcs even he does it also it s crazy bc after garret i always thought rated was a super nice chill dude
pot calling the kettle black i haven t watched rp in like years but i gotta say penta treats people like absolute garbage there for him and his chat s entertainment and then talks shit constantly on other streamers when they call him out he is like the kid who hits their older brother then when their older brother hits them back he cries to their mom
lol penta one to talk
isn t this due the exact same everything i ve seen of penta has just been him being a shitty person
a bit rich from penta cause i m not sure the server owners partiularly like him either
i absolutely despise this dude
streamers trying to not harass people challenge impossible
hasn t penta been involved in a bunch of drama sure not to the scale of what rated allegedly did but still in and out of rp
ok i have the same opinion as penta but literally says him
a bit rich coming from the dude who said the n word while rping as a black character
deleted
sez u lulw
fuck you penta
irrelevant people

also massive vindication for the guy who s got so much shit from cg and their sycophants for years
and to think we thought we were over the gta v rp drama arc with xqc quitting
honestly i ve never seen any smallish gaming community where people are frequently interacting with the same people that hasn t gone toxic or filled with drama
i dont been watching for years these guys are literal actors they play a character unfortunately given the nature and the way the server is set it affects mental state for example big war in rp you get shot down and are streaming people jump over and hop making fun of you your next minuites consists on laying down and waiting for medics thats boring for stream when you do win a fight parasocial invested viewers go crazy with support that shits gotta warp your brain
lol figures i dropped figures on my chipotle today
well it s not just gta rp it s gta rp influencers
i used to run rp a small community with a friend of mine back in and we ended up shutting down in late mainly because the community got so shitty and toxic when rp gained more traction lmao it was already crazy back then but it s even worse now
gta rp is kinda the only category that forces streamers to actually interact even ones that don t like each other now imagine any other big twitch drama but the streamers involved were constantly playing a game that lead to those involved often interacting in the game from different opposing sides
speaking as someone who did gta rp for a couple years a lot of these folks think they re actors and with that comes the drama fueled shit we see sporadically on lsf twitter main character syndrome and the fact that for whatever reason gta rp attracts some of the absolute worst types of folks imaginable to play make believe in los santos some parts of me miss it but when i want to do rp i just join a tabletop gaming campaign i at least know the people im getting into shit with
hundreds of hours for figures i need to make my own rp server
people just be like that and us more fucked up ones gravitate toward the internet
to be fair i think this amount of drama toxicity is always bound to happen when you have s of individual streamers interacting everyday we see the drama from just a week rust wipe content server
of course there will be drama with any large ish group of people but it s all about how it s handled or not handled
low figures aka 1k
the fact your friend sold shares in a gta rp server for low figures is kinda mind blowing to me years ago something like this would be a whatever game hobby with a couple hundred players only like custom servers with any money were like esea and faceit now i read posts about gtarp servers losing thousands in value following a rule change feels almost dystopian to my boomer ass lol
self inserts are a hell of a thing
drama is human nature
this seems to be a problem with all small ish communities that run on servers like that everyone basically knowing each other provides a bigger opportunity to be even more degen than normal since the connections run deeper than some random that you encounter solo queueing in some mainstream game that you ll never play with again i played minecraft factions way back in the day and the amount of degenerate shit that i ve heard about and personally witnessed is nuts from a fairly small community compared to the wider minecraft playerbase playing a gamemode that was basically rust in block form before rust ever became a thing i remember a top mod on one of the largest servers getting literally arrested because he was soliciting nudes from an underage girl for spawning in end game items for her group shit was nuts
found the long term sub
oh he s still doing that he s just gone from costco chickens down to
hes such a fucking fucker i fucking hate him
sandy office motel
yeah i m unsubbing now i only watch fat streamers
he changed man it used to be rotisserie chickens over the sink now it s sushi and a home gym
i don t watch him but i m pretty sure he has had cancer at some point would assume he lost a shit ton of weight
yes we also saw the clip
that clip of pred getting into a shouting match with rated randy he s a self insert anyway while he s in jail still lives with me for how much of a chad he is how do you guys even put up with guys like this
to be fair it is almost impossible to bully penta or out roast him
deleted
tell us who or is it just hate speech
awoo
awoooo
he did i also think it started to grow in straight again and not in curls like it was due to the chemo treatments
he went bald after going through chemo again during covid his hair never grew back the same he had some fabio hair and a beard that d make people with beards cry i guess it never grew back the same but still looks damn good
that sounds like some s tier projection by cg the gang that only has one woman member that isn t an already clouted big streamer or in an irl relationship with a different member
when did cg accused him of being disrespectful to women in rp i m actually curious i know there were a few women rpers that had problems with pentas jordan steele character but idk if cg mentioned anything since they have pretty much done the same things he did
deleted
homo sapiens a human streamer
hobbittrash she went in on him and his twitter followers
help me wut why would they go to the guy that plays jordan steele for help instead of the server owner or staff
you re telling me he s happy a verifiably abusive shithead is banned oh my god someone call the media
i don t think penta actually hates cg or rated their conflict has always been in character between cop vs criminal they actually get along when he plays mike block his main problem over the years is the youtube channels and the cg hoppers outside of rp penta switch off and focus on enjoying his life
np made an announcement that rated was banned from their server last week today garrett tweeted out that rated was also no longer part of their chain gang brand rated told his discord earlier that he d go live and tell his side this is after claiming to have no idea why he was banned i m not evil owner of np koil made an announcement before rated went live to squash any possibly gaslighting and lying from rated the announcement heavily implied sa or sh was linked to the ban
ratedepicz got perma d from nopixel and kicked out of chang gang one of the top gangs in the roleyplaying server in gta5 rumor is that its because hes an abuser
better then gamba
sorry it isn t one of the xqc react clips or mizkif clips you love so much
just google kermodo dog cage
he locked andy richter in a room
because rated s characters definitely weren t just direct self inserts right that s the difference penta actually roleplays it s not just a social server for some people
and where did you get that logic from penta didn t treat anyone like they aren t human beings most of his dramas are with people who talked shit to him first and he responded back
well yea its human nature he s gonna have to use the bathroom eventually you eat ass so you should know about these things
deleted
wonder which sub dominates lsf https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps/livestreamfail)
funny because anyone that actually knows penta always says he s a really nice guy and a good friend just because he made your rp streamer mad doesn t make him a bad person
put a clip of how it s ironic i have never watched a single penta stream only seen him in clips but i ve never seen a clip that would make this ironic surely you have receipts
elaborate
outside of rp who does he treat poorly other than kermodo of course because he fucking deserves it

some context timeline updating as it goes earlier this week rated gets messaged in the middle of his stream https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apfeajpbvr0), presumably with a admin telling him that he s perma banned and to log off the server he sounds legitimately distraught and shaken when he was messaged and ended stream viewers are surprised because rated is one of the biggest streamer in the nopixel community and big streamers very rarely get long bans by management admin because they bring in a lot of money views to the server koil nopixel s server owner later speaks about his ban https://clips.twitch.tv/trustworthydependablejuicetbcheesepull-_uw5_z9w0dkpra1k), saying that everyone on np s staff admins had unanimously agreed to perma ban him from np with no option for appealing it super surprising because in the past koil has literally said that rated would have to shit on my chest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnc6wxwwfvg) in order to get permabanned from the server some additional context whenever np perma bans someone they are allowed to file a appeal on their perma ban after days if a big name gets perma ban with no appeal that means they probably did some fucked up shit like exploiting hacking racist sexist homophobic etc at this point viewers speculate that this is metoo related and that np is protecting the identity of the victims by not revealing the situation some viewers noted that at some point cg streamers also auto banning any chatters that mention rated s name in chat a chatter later asks koil about rated s ban and koil said he crossed a line that was unacceptable https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhnolrmhia8) for the community koil doesn t mind trash talk and have defended rated multiple times in the past regarding bans but he can t defend him on this one one of the most common line that i ve seen from rated defenders is how do you ban someone and not let him defend himself against his accusers or np didn t even tell him what he did to warrant a ban so how can he improve himself koil responds back saying that he s not rated s fucking dad and that he shouldn t have to tell him not to do really fucked up shit he again says that they can t go into the specifics because of the circumstances rated claims that np told him that they banned him for tos reasons https://streamable.com/dd3uz8) and didn t tell him the specifics for the ban so he has no clue he will start streaming variety and other games going forward and doesn t want his viewers to harass anyone he claims that i m not a evil person chang gang announces on twitter that they re parting ways with rated shotz a member of cg was really emotional on the situation https://streamable.com/ras6ev) and said that it really hurts rated announces on his discord https://i.redd.it/lwecewecmasa1.png) that he s going to go live soon to clear things up because he genuinely does not know what he did and he knows his truths koil drops a message on discord in response https://external-preview.redd.it/rmcoxhuzgkmgun_l8f9xfu9sqjgeqs1qc__verm1fzi.png?auto=webp&v=enabled&s=771d49ab2d5066c1f141076cd89b16fcd02a0dce) encouraging any women on the server to come forward if they were mistreated by a recent figure removed from the community as multiple women already have done so this confirms what the community initially suspected some tweets from other women rpers on np evee on how rated would dm her for cam shows https://twitter.com/eveettv/status/1644118519603159043?s=20) and other weird shit and instantly deleting the message afterwards so she doesn t have proof and it becomes a he said she said situation olly responding to evee s tweet https://twitter.com/ollypopau/status/1644141829565349888?s=20) asking if they had all experienced the same thing evee https://twitter.com/eveettv/status/1644152800228646914?s=20) and olly https://twitter.com/ollypopau/status/1644143048845316098/photo/1) both posted screenshots of their discord dms with rated the messages and responses are nonsensical hinting that rated had deleted messages in between their response cathfawr on how rated was toxic and misogynistic for years https://twitter.com/cathfawr/status/1644105720344764416?s=46&t=namzsiknwg7zbjsnscek3q) and how he would actively rile his community to send hate towards her and a few other female officers lyndi on how she s open to talk to anyone who was a victim https://twitter.com/lyndi__/status/1644099257559834626?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw%7ctwcamp%5etweetembed%7ctwterm%5e1644099257559834626%7ctwgr%5e66780f8cb916d7d2d93d9829c21f39227d604379%7ctwcon%5es1_&ref_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.redditmedia.com%2fmediaembed%2f12dzrpx%3fresponsive%3dtrueis_nightmode%3dfalse) since she dated rated for over years hobbittrash on how she would get dms from people asking if she s trans https://twitter.com/hobbittrash/status/1644074012241436674) or similar messages and whenever she checks who they re following rated is usually on their followed list
any tldr why he got nuked so fast from everywhere
bro got fired from a virtual gang
koil statement about rated https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1078461018377818192/1093593093296640010/screenshot_2023-04-06_at_19.48.18.png)
aint no way chang gang is an org lmao
wow this one is the most damning accusation out in the open so far https://twitter.com/eveettv/status/1644118519603159043?s=20](https://twitter.com/eveettv/status/1644118519603159043?s=20) creepy as fuck imagine asking your co workers to give you a cam show

imagine if fb gaming drops him pausechamp
makes me wonder if ramee knew something back then https://www.reddit.com/r/rpclipsgta/comments/l78aaa/rated\_is\_currently\_discussing\_the\_cg\_x\_ramee/
now it makes sense why the cops he hated the most were females
oh man this really has to be bad
its pretty much confirmed now all the accusations becoming true including lyndi go check her twitter
i like how you added both the copyright trademark logos at the end to emphasize how seriously these make believe rp gangs take themselves
that s honestly impressive for ratedepicz to fuck up that badly with his actions to be booted out of an e gang like that like imagine a situation you re paid pretty well for playing pretend with your coworkers friends in a game but instead you choose to just treat women like shit so you end of up throwing your whole career for being a sexist misogynist absolute legendary fumble ripbozo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqhjzrechv0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqhjzrechv0) rated is pretty obsessive
guys all of this was just roleplay
should be banned for the phrase my truths bitch theres no such thing other than the actual truth
for the rest of my life whenever im having a bad day im going to remember this and tell myself it could be worse at least i didn t get blooded out of a e gang i hate the overused word cringe but i cant think of a more fitting one
imagine someone always spouting toxicity was actually toxic maybe they should crack down on ooc toxicity from certain groups and actually improve their community
aka when this shit does come out we want there to be distance between us when your closest friends ditch you you must have done something really bad which is a shame because rated actually felt like the most likeable person in cg i guess only time will tell
chang gang the most toxic roleplayer group have someone who have done some shady shit and they can t say anything and have to kick that person out color me surprised who is next from this group lol
i can never understand why it s so hard to just be a decent human being
you taking a shit on my chest bruv
never liked this guy back when gta rp was popular he always seemed a bit too passive aggressive to everyone almost confrontational all the time u could say that it is rp but something about it just wasn t normal it just felt like the guy is psychopath he never interacted for sake of interacting with others he just always tried to provoke others like passively attacking people ooc while making it seem like roleplay idek how to explain it but u could easily see that the guy was just evil
what was his gta rp character s name i m not good with telling who is who
rated is basically done
it s wild to me that this is clearly because of something he did inappropriate irl yet we have serial rp frogs in here trying to attach it to other non related dramas never change gtarp reddit
nooooo not chang gang
ripbozo smoking on that misogynist pack
there is no way more of these guys aren t complicit with their frat mentality
fuslie valkyrae better come out with an announcement that rated was never truly cube gang curtis stocks up
what character did he play
most entertaining thing to come from no pixel in a while
hasn t this guy always been a dick
i never understand why it s call chang gang till i realize that it started by a guy who uses a stereotypical asian accent making fortnite youtube till he got big in gta and have to tone it down to sign his facebook deal
cy cube gang
ok
always seemed like a dickhead so good riddance that clip of him crying on stream when he gets banned from nopixel is art
wow a piece of shit human is a piece of shit
successful male streamer with influence guaranteed something with sexual assault or racism
https://youtu.be/nhohte8gwhg edited spelling just gotta leave this here imagine only him getting on 100t
remember a few months ago when those allegations came out against rated for harassment against a female
ripbozo l chang gang
coming to a roleplay group decision in to kick someone who has already been permabanned is kinda funny
im so happy that i stopped watching gtarp its just a bunch of self centered pos s running around attacking people and getting their stans to attack them too
he made millions playing gta rp i think he will be fine plus he can just stream on other servers or just play other games and have a large following unless somehow he gets banned from facebook and twitch which i doubt would happen considering other streamers have done probably worse and are still on the platform
saying released like he was signed to a contract with an org they were a group of friends and he fucked up bad they are showing that they do not support his actions and are cutting ties
who released from what
cringe gang
dude got blooded out irl
bro got blooded out irl o7 gangy
yeah and if we learned anything from other streamers is that time will pass and people will forget and they ll continue on making a paycheck and everything goes back to normal streaming to 10k 20k viewers did we all forget about mizkif atrioc kai bruce adin or the chick who was getting railed live i know i m forgetting a lot more but my point is they ve all had instances of bans related to serious situations and yet are all still here streaming to an audience profiting from it the cycle continues
i hope this incident shines light on how toxic that gang is they should be angels going forward
never thought i d live the day to see a virtual gang in a grand theft auto roleplay server make an announcement like this the grass has never been greener
sykkuno fans are validated we never liked him apart from the first days he interacted with sykkuno just something off about the way rated interacted with others
lmao they said they wanna distance from him because of what he did and if it comes to light they would be cancelled yet they are saying it s not anyone s business and it s nothing that bad so which one is it horrible and you don t wanna get cancelled or you just dropped him because you wanted to i feel once this comes out people can and probably will cancel them even harder for saying this
without assuming i think it s safe to assume lol that it s sexual harassment assault related
lmfao
w h omegalul
lol an rp gang y all forget it s fake
did a gta rp pretend gang just release an official statement seems odd to me is cg an actual thing business outside of rp
lmaooo no shot they are making announcements for their little gta rp group
deleted
lean boys chang gang
not trying to be an asshole but who gives a fuck
actually 5head strat that he never showed his face name grabbed the bag some titties and remained anonymous
honestly who cares dude is still a multi millionaire in his young 20s getting e cancelled is irrelevant
who
still the least toxic rp player lol
just speculation but rated had been lieing about his real name and hiding his face for a long time and recently revealed his real name wonder if he had a criminal past he was trying to hide somthing like that
jean paul was right batchest most same rpers
what did he actually do though in some other community i had a woman once with a mean girl personality lazily doctor screenshots and say i did something once took an hour to sort out and unban me and get her in trouble as a complete fucking fraud but the receipts should always be released weird to say someone did something did they quite possibly but it s better to have a look at the evidence
so is this role play or in real life
nopixel management and staff only has allegations from scorned women right now they want more women to come forward with evidence of any sexual abuse at the hands of ratedepicz if they had any hard evidence of sexual abuse or assault this would have been reported to law enforcement already i don t doubt rated is a toxic piece of shit but until there is actual evidence of his alleged mistreatment of women i ll reserve my judgement on him nopixel and cg are doing the only thing they can in this situation cut ties from ratedepicz so they can t be accused of covering up sexual abuse assault allegations

deleted
keep this shit on the rp subreddit we do not care about rp drama
we do not care
stupidest drama ever
wh omegalul
who from who
who what why is this even here
kick one member or find a new server comparable to nopixel for the rest of cg to play with him on seems like a business move to cut ties
no one cares about no pixel shit

who from what
i mean where else would this person be chang gang if not nopixel
people still care about rp since xqc quit
so tldr he actually did shit on koils chest

oh so that s why koil had like 7k viewers the other day
thanks for doing this it s nice to not have to search around for rumors speculation
want to say thanks for giving some context to the situation havent watched rp in months but to hear a main member of cg is gone is sad
why is it that almost every time something like this happens there is literally proof of anything and it s all a he said she said and let s make sure we mega cancel him because she said so i mean sure if he did something and there s proof of it sure ban em but like what lol

how do you possibly whiff in chess
holy shit an actual live stream fail this is historic
his anal beads must ve bugged out during that moment
i m not sure it was a mouse slip looking at the eval bar hikaru s king capturing e7 is a game throwing move i m supposing magnus did not see it coming and auto piloted into doing some other move he had prepared because there s no way hikaru would play any move but the one that doesn t throw the game away
honestly i think it s a massive disrespect to your opponent they are fighting for the win and all they get in the end is you won because my mouse slipped get your fucking mouse fixed already holy shit
he litterally doesn t care
could also be a brain slip
only won cause mouse slip lul
the botez sisters and queens gambit tried to make chess intense but i still find it kinda goofy to get it twisted about while recognising many people find it incredible nail biting heart stopping stuff
mwda megalul
hikaru beat magnus the red
its been awhile since i played chess but when black queen took e6 wasn t that a checkmate why did black king kill white pawn and white queen after is this a different type of chess
feel like the only clips i ve seen of super gms doing this have been from magnus guy needs to get better at using a mouse i ve watched hikaru for years playing blitz and bullet can t remember too many mouse slips
what move was magnus trying to do take the pawn on b6
magnus needs to upgrade to like an osu setup
what is he my grandpa
does he have like crazy high dpi or something you d think after the first time he d buy a mouse with a decent sensor and lower that shit to like dpi so its really hard to make such errors
dude should hop into some aimlabs to practice not mouse slipping
this dude clicks the pieces instead of dragging them annoys the hell out of me
magnus is the biggest tech stuff boomer i wouldn t be surprised if he didn t realise if someone swapped his mouse for the old one with ball instead of laser xd
hikaru and every chess gm should have omegalul their asshole to the camera after every win to prove he isn t cheating
if anything magnus beads vibrated so much that he mouse slipped during orgasm
he d be like rated on chess com if he didn t mouse slip every 3rd game
at this point its a skill issue get him on some aim labs
my guy celebrating like it was the most deserved win ever
in the end he refuses to correct a recurring mistake which is a skill issue
yeah needs to grind mouse inputs more
man spends his stream not caring and eating mango salad nut mix and lean turkey
please stop sexualizing men
probably because the queen can move to the most places making it easier to drop it in a place you didn t mean to and have it still be a legal move
yes but it is not a very good system it doesn t cover the common vibrating anal beads cheat until the contestants perform a cavity check and play with no pants we can never know if they are cheating or not
yes the players have to have a camera behind them recording their screen and surroundings it is an anti cheat measure otherwise you could just pull up an analysis board on a second monitor or have your phone propped up next to you
it s blitz in the olympics isn t it it s not like a time scramble otb is much better someone on r chess linked this clip https://youtu.be/tjk2t6yzhpk?t=14
i mean if you slip in a race is kinda the same no an unintended action that does not reflect your skill
i mean that s the same as every other sport right if a sprinter slips or baseball player misses the ball then that s also a human made mistake
that s like saying no other esport should be a thing because you can mouse slip magnus mouse slips an unusually high amount of times more than any other top pro
no but really
the king take on e7 was the best move and the game was a draw after that the sudden eval bar drop in the clip is in hikaru s favor as the other reply said magnus probably wanted qxb6
i think magnus was planning on qxb6
most likely a mouse slip top players don t hang queens like that
hikaru had draw odds so he wouldve won anyway assuming he doesn t get flagged
the black queen never takes on e6 but regardless the rules for checkmate are king is in check king has no legal moves to get out of check those didn t both happen at the same time since the king was always able to move away or block
that s my assumption but magnus carlsen is at least slightly better at chess than me
its actually the oposite if i dont recall wrong like his sensitivity is so low than when he gets in time scrambles he cant move the mouse properly he did an almost exact same blunder in a time scramble in titled tuesday against hikaru
fr and turn off mouse accel
lower dpi can sometimes be much worse you need fast cursor movement to move quickly and save time mistakes could also just be due to accidentally letting go of his mouse button when clicking and dragging a piece which dpi would not really help though im not sure what mechanic he uses to move his pieces he might not use click and drag
should just play on a tablet touchpad
seems like clicking would be less prone to mistakes what is wrong with clicking
its actually the oposite if i dont recall wrong like his sensitivity is so low than when he gets in time scrambles he cant move the mouse properly he did an almost exact same blunder in a time scramble in titled tuesday against hikaru edit ment to reply to the other guy
bruh
as long as there s days before the next tourney it should be fine
a true gentleman s game
mandatory post game goatse
wouldn t work if they have a permanent one installed you d need to stick a camera in there
that is not normally
a win is a win
it s armageddon and he has black so he beats magnus with a draw or a win hikaru is going to draw that position of the time so it was deserved with or without the mouse slip
better fingers won
he s an asshole so it s okay
couldn t they just stand on their chair and prolapse their asshole on stream
doesn t catch hikaru s roof monitor
wtf is this shit xd
one of my personal favorites https://youtu.be/vzvhb11ia3g)
i d say this is more akin to the starting blocks moving when a race begins or the wind knocking over a hurdle during a race but fair point
how is that the same at all chess is a game that can easily be played physically in person what s the need to make it an esport for big competitions i don t see any way of playing over watch without computers though
ah yeah duh it goes black and stays black actual oof
they do in time scrambles when they re predicting moves magnus probably thought qxb6 was theory
yea i met e2 and now i see white kings way out thanks
yeah i just watched some clips of the past one man needs to hit up some old school runescape pkers some of those guys have insane mouse accuracy and speed insert any b0aty mouse click clips here on mobile so can t find links atm
actual mechanics diff
cause if you are going too fast you can intend do click accidental drag click imo for digital chess it should be like fps games if your mouse skill isn t up to par that s part of the game
boomer shit
specially agaisnt magnus
ok that makes more sense
is he i remember years ago people loved the guy and what he was doing to bring chess into the spotlight did something happen
classic ceiling engine
french peasants circa
feels incorrect to compare a user error to something out of the persons control no a mouse slip can be solved by being better controlling the wind not so much
how is that the same at all chess is a game that can easily be played physically in person what s the need to make it an esport for big competitions because it s more smooth to play chess on a computer
there s also a pretty big window of error for over the board chess though when both players are in time crunch and playing on a few seconds increment it gets pretty messy and crazy and honestly all precision is gone and since both players have no time whatsoever i don t even think the players themselves know what is truly going on in the board look at a few of the clips linked above in the thread at least with digital chess there s no ambiguity over what square a piece would be on a time crunch so there s a precision of of what is going on in the real game
yeah players low on time do silly mistakes hikaru missed m1 yesterday
odablock has the same amazing accuracy and speed when it comes to pk ing with extremely low dpi settings but its mostly because his game is shrunk pretty small if magnus has terrible accuracy problems with a mouse due to super low dpi settings he could try playing the game in a smaller window but its chess so idk how that d play out

fyi he calls it bad cause he can probably smash it and says he will continue to do runs after this dont think it will take long as the pressure is off now hes not happy with that time my guess is he wants a sub
he s been vocal for days with how much he hated star but he s still grinding the category because he says the wr was a bad run the dedication is incredible
hide your sm64 wr suigi is coming
can t wait for him to start doing stars runs
can t wait for the summoning salt feature about his wr hunt
kids a fucking monster
he is the only speed runner in sm64 who i think can get wr may take a bit since he needs to learn but his movement is so clean he will be able to obliterate star after
dudes collecting wr like thanos how much of a flex would it be to say uve gotten every wr in a game crazy thing is i think he can do it
they are taking our jobs

i turned my volume way the hell down in anticipation of the pop off
i see the sum of best is like does that mean his best segments were going for human viable tas strats or something and aren t going to be realistic for a full run
is it not a highly contested wr i figured such a short run would not have so much wiggle room for him to improve in such a popular speed running game
supposedly practicing it already off stream give it less than a year before he holds the wr in that too
do we know how much learning he has to do does he ever do on stream
i think that is suigi s sum of his best segments
it s not super popular kanno used to run it a lot a while ago but not sure how many people are currently at it
yeah i wouldn t be surprised he s too good
boxbox said he would donate 5k to him if he got the wr by the end of the year
https://www.speedrun.com/user/suigi looks like he doesn t play it much
he does some practice streams

clip mirror moistcr1tikal explains why twitch s new sponsor stream experience is bad for streamers https://arazu.io/t3_12dt9z0/)** this is an automated comment
small streamers with no talent agents will benefit the most from this bounties system something moist ignored completely as he is a big name and doesn t care if twitch provide those easy to take deals then i don t get why anyone would get mad at them for taking a percentage they are fully creating those opportunities
so then get a sponsor yourself offer your work for a bit less than twitch pays them and enjoy your money what the sponsor would have never reached out and you would have never gotten any sponsorships oh uuh anyway big company bad
twitch s head of monetization responded about it on twitter https://twitter.com/mikeminton/status/1643733212433387521?s=20](https://twitter.com/mikeminton/status/1643733212433387521?s=20) now idk if he s lying or not but that explanation makes sense
insert coke gaming copypasta here
this is gonna make viewing experience so much worse imagine finishing ads only for streamers to start the scripted infomercial shill for their sponsor it kinda defeats the point of bypassing ads looks this platform is going the same route as e sports orgs extract as much value until it gets sold bankrupt dissolved
tldr twitch makes a twitter post https://twitter.com/mikeminton/status/1643733212433387521?s=20), but its so poorly written without clarification at the time of the post that the whole point went to shit concludes in missunderstanding supposedly it s a feature additional service for brands to pay for additional noise therefore more money for the streamer twitch isn t looking to take of the streamers sponsorship money only half of the amount the streamer earns through gifted subs the brand purchases through said feature twitch introduces new ways of monetizing streams thats a good thing but more clarification is needed as this scenario may become a thing twitch could in theory without clarification change how bounties work a bounty could be reworked to gifted sub equivalent to thought this has to split between the streamer twitch it s tempting to assume why twitch would implement such feature thought i think its best to wait untill future clarification
idk why they just don t wait for the program to drop with full details before making their conclusions about it
am i supposed to feel bad for a streamer who makes more money than i
twitch streamers truly believe there is no costs to operate a massive platform
poor baby will only make 20k for playing an hour of overwatch or some shit now all while those filthy freeloading shits watching get subs they don t deserve for shame
keep in mind this is on top of the fact that the payouts from sponsors offered via bounties are already a fraction of the money the sponsor is spending to advertise twitch takes the lion s share of the payout brands don t want to bother contacting streamers or their agencies directly so they just give twitch a lump sum that they take most of then offer whats left on the bounty boards for streamers of x viewership to complete they re doing the job of an agency bringing in the sponsor but unlike an agency they don t need to disclose how much the actual deal is or how much they re taking vs what the streamer gets so this is twitch skimming even more off from these sponsors if you re a big enough streamer you should be seeing what brands are trying to advertise on twitch and contact them directly if that becomes more common brands will cut out twitch as the middle man
what browser is he using loooks cleeeaaaaan
these are things that they do already now it will just be official also if you don t like a deal just don t take it or go through the effort to contact the company yourself or manager to get a better deal if you want it served on a silver plate by twitch you get their deal if not you put in the work yourself simple
can i participate in these experiments we just started testing and we re working with a limited group of streamers and brands to develop this concept further as this is still early stages we re currently not widely recruiting streamers to participate if anything changes we ll be sure to let you know when will i have access to these solutions in the near term these solutions will only be available to a limited number of streamers as we experiment and learn because we re in the early stages of testing we ll continue to develop each experience as we learn more about what works best for our community and advertisers you ll hear from us in the coming months once we have more to share with the community good thing twitch are value neutral and wont be playing favorites and acting as the de facto mediary wont eat up the marketspace for individual streamers who accidentally fall outside of twitchs good graces xd
raid going to be making bank
if it s an opt in then i don t see how it s a problem then are some small streamers that don t even know how to go about getting sponsors yet
tired of seeing rich streamers complain about money
there is so much assumptions being made about the system before the details have even been announced maybe just wait before you raise the pitchforks
good that streamers make less money
such a blatant money grab if i hadn t already as a streamer lost trust in my employer then this would definitely do it

poor wittle streamers how will they live
i don t get the hate for the system it s mostly going to be used by smaller streamers that don t have an agency or manager and it ll help them build up a portfolio of experience to use later on when they approach sponsors themselves
i wonder how much moist and other larger streamers understand the small streamer market it s can t be easy to grow and profit on twitch with how saturated the streaming scene is
big streamers make tens of thousands of dollars in minutes with bounty board one of the tasks only required him to stream a specific event or game for minutes and the bounty was worth a total of https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/asmongold-reveals-insane-twitch-bounty-value-for-just-10-minutes-of-work-2009973/) mizkif makes a month from bounties https://livestreamfails.com/post/102475) big streamers are trying to convince small streamers this is bad for them because small streamers entering the competition means they will have to share the pool of money
the sponsorship bounty system is a good one that many most creators have praised and really is great for smaller streamers the ones i actually watch tend to be at the concurrents range and it is very obvious when they checked the board x200b how does bounties benefit them more everything i have seen of the new system means more money goes to twitch and less to the streamer going through https://twitter.com/twitchsupport/status/1643348191968993282](https://twitter.com/twitchsupport/status/1643348191968993282) and the only thing that looks like it might benefit streamers is the talking points which like always will have massive issues where streamers aren t making it clear what is a testimonial and what is truth but is potentially a really good way to reduce the number of ad blocks during a stream
he didn t ignore it completely and acknowledged multiple times during the stream that it s useful for super recent small streamers
issues is that its like sub viewers who get the most from it and most brands don t really get that much from those streams and knowing twitch i doubt they will focus on getting those deals
he literally mentioned that in the stream
despite the bar being so low moist may just be the lowest effort big streamer
you are surprised greedy streamers are mad that they won t be able to make 10k on a 10min ad
take is insane regardless
this isn t the best clip to show his complete thoughts he did mention it in his stream that it could benefit smaller new streamers
because these millionaire streamers don t want competition fuck anyone defending the morons
they re basically doing what an agent does which big streamers like moist should be well aware of
the money spent on gift subs has to come from somewhere this means only two things are possible the sponsor is going to spend additional money they otherwise wouldn t have spent on giving away gift subs the sponsor is going to spend the same amount of total money but now some of it is going toward gift subs and therefore going to twitch he s acting like it ll be but it s going to be sponsors are not going to suddenly decide to increase their advertising budgets because of a new twitch feature there s also absolutely zero way the head of monetization is not aware of this fact this is simply twitch looking for a way to take a piece of the pie for sponsorships
it all comes from the same pot though so it would replace normal compensation a brand isn t just going to give more money
what was stopping them from doing that before tho
thats how i imagined it would be dunno how people came up with the replacement thing it s kinda like how cashapp or whoever it was a few years ago would show up in big streams and drop a few hundred subs and then dip just to advertise
remember what twitch said about compensation when moving to the split the whole this is a relationship between content creators and the platform and both need to share compensation baloney even if it s not happening with this particular push once these changes are finalized twitch will be imposing a cut of all sponsored segments in the future they will use these features as reason why they deserve it
i mean unless your streamers are always streaming sponsored content it shouldn t be a big issue
how exactly do you expect these streamers to make money dont you want to see those small streamers succeed this is such a bad take you as a viewer pay nothing to watch streams its free and for you to come on here and bitch and cry because your free service now has ads is ridiculous and if you re subbed im sure you dont care what the streamer is playing anyways because you enjoy them for the creator they are and not the game they play whether they re playing your favorite game or a sponsored game if you really enjoy a streamer you ll watch them
streamers have done sponsored streams for ages this will change nothing if anything the viewers will benefit more by getting gifted subs instead of nothing if this results in a streamer taking more sponsors thats different but that depends solely on the content creator
how is that tweet poorly written its a tweet he layed it pretty clearly they are allowing sponsors to also hand out subscriptions on top of the money for the sponsorship are you some type of moron also i cant stand seeing you twitter users get up in arms about a tweet not explaining things accurately you rejects want a two page dissertation in the form of a character tweet
oldest grift on the internet content creators get the most donations when they can put out a video stream like youtube is trying to kill my channel it s just a form of drama farming
this is wayyy too broad of a generalization i work in marketing you want to maximize every dollar and your time if twitch is eating into a brand s budget and not delivering good value the program will die it s that simple x200b they re doing the job of an agency bringing in the sponsor but unlike an agency they don t need to disclose how much the actual deal is or how much they re taking vs what the streamer gets yeah twitch takes a cut so do agencies and not all agencies are upfront about their cut they package creators into bundles for one thing the difference is twitch is the one running the platforming and absorbing of the cost of hosting the content they know their ad model sucks so they re doing something different that benefits the viewer more than a straight up ad read x200b if you re a big enough streamer you should be seeing what brands are trying to advertise on twitch and contact them directly if that becomes more common brands will cut out twitch as the middle man exactly but if you re a big streamer and don t have representation bringing you deals you re wasting your time but brands don t want to deal with small streamers all those w2s 1099s ndas conduct agreements etc they want turn key solutions so they work with an agency or they work with a platform
opera gx https://www.opera.com/gx) i believe i have never used it so i don t know how good it is but it does look nice
aka good that jeff bezos makes more money in exchange
tbh a lot of moist s friends are small streamers rex kaia jackson matt etc he also has a company that works with small to large content creators i think he may understand it more than most but is probably only thinking about how it effects him
i didn t watch the entire thing idk if he mentioned this but as far as i know talent agencies don t charge anywhere near splits from the little i know about it that seems like highway robbery yes it might give access to sponsorships for smaller streamers but it s basically poor taxing the creators that can least afford it imo again i have not watched moist s entire video
so a huge benefit for of streamers streamers and not as great for streamers pulling in 10k month the absolute horror
cut for a sponsorship the streamer otherwise wouldn t have gotten sounds like a great deal don t try telling me that those brands would ever reach out to those small streamers it s a simple thing of it s a good thing for the streamer
take is insane regardless cam models only get a cut so against that a take is not bad
it s not that strange though i work with a hobby company for my hobby for fun beside real job amazon and wholesale retailers in general take if you buy it from our webshop we get if you buy it over amazon at a local place we get
i mean yes it s obviously twitch looking for a way to take a cut but and that s the big thing no one is talking about currently agencies etc already take to from those sponsorships and faze was taking like from tfue s or something if twitch take a cut it doesn t necessarly need to be that much bigger for it to still be interesting to do for them and sure it may be a loss of money for big streamers but think of all the medium small size streamers like 1k to ccv that could live from streaming with sponsorships but aren t worth the big agencies time they could benefit from this
they ve been trying to get viewers to use less money on third party spending as much as they can the biggest and most obvious one before this was bits they hate that viewers are giving streamers money and not giving them any so they come up with whatever methods they can to eat into it at least bits have you a badge let you tts and most of it went to the streamer this is just a straight up we re taking half you money now if streamers can t opt out of it they will be making sure the contract doesn t include it it will be an option or nothing at all scenario for them most likely
option could also work without twitch taking a cut it doesn t cost twitch anything to give someone a sub apart from maybe lost ad revenue so the sponsor could just pay whatever cut the streamer gets it s not that far fetched when they already have a system like twitch prime where twitch pays out the streamers cut except in this case the sponsor covers it
budgets are not everything tv style advertising doesn t work that good on twitch you can t blame twitch or advertisers for wanting more community engagement with brands sponsors
the only good argument someone could make is that if this type of advertising style is more successful than regular advertising meaning it generates more positive engagement then maybe the value of a twitch streamer advertising a product increases and that increment could eventually offset the initial loss of revenue to twitch so imagine streamer a gets paid 10k for a sponsorship with the new model streamer a gets 8k cash and 2k in subs then they make 9k instead of 10k but if this model is more successful the streamer can ask for 12k next time they get 10k cash and 2k in subs 11k total an additional 1k revenue that exists because of the increased engagement the gifted sub advertising tool brings
streamers would normally negotiate the split and say they prefer one but smaller streamers have no recourse and will take whatever is offered
the sponsor is going to spend the same amount of total money but now some of it is going toward gift subs and therefore going to twitch some of the ad spend was already going to twitch so nothing changed in that regard
yeah i think you re spot on if they decide to pay x streamer for a sponsor spot they aren t going to pay plus add on subs they are simply going to pay less up front and pay some in subs which literally only helps twitches pockets
brands want return on investment and gifting people shit in this case subs is a very strong way to give people a good impression so they might spend a bit more to do that which is why you ll often see giveways in sponsored streams etc
nothing in fact it was the main advertising method for that shitty paypal clone that sponsored a bunch of gambling streamers and trains podcast except it pissed off a lot of streamers because they knew what they were doing which was paying far less money for an ad without a contract than what the streamers would accept so a lot of them just talked shit about them and banned it
they were already doing it https://youtu.be/khfhzclb6lq
yup pretty much and back then all of them praised cashapp for doing it but somehow now it s not good anymore if twitch has anything to do with it like i get some outrages but being mad at any actions they take kinda make them look like angry kids lmao
yeah it also keeps viewers around so i would assume some streamers might like it more as viewers usually drop hard during sponsored segments
okay we get it u like watching ads infomercials
i already pay to avoid ads but still have to wait out the ad breaks on some streams sounds like you re the one crying by your tone if you think ad spam won t decrease viewership to the platform idk what to tell you don t be mad at me be mad at the ones at the top trying to increase their profit margins
lol this looks like one of those god awful chrome firefox themes
yes
yeah tired of using aws just for amazon to use that money to subsidise some millionaire streamers on twitch
yeah but they all have access to connections that non connected small streamers dont have
it s not a for sure we have no idea how much they will take he is just talking about gift subs they would be because that how subs work i think it s just something brands would be able to do randomly without working out a deal
again x200b what would have initially been money that goes to the streamer now goes to twitch and the streamer x200b you can argue that the streamer has additional filters and cuts before it gets to the actual talent but it is still less money going to the end destination and your entire argument hinges on companies will pay more money for the same thing they were getting before x200b also i am curious how smaller streamers would benefit from this they get a larger cut of the streamer portion of the cash but that portion is still being slashed
there is no shot twitch will be forcing sponsors on streamers there is no need to opt out when they would have to chose to do the sponsor the first time they force a sponsored stream on someone and they say this sponsor is so shit no one ever buy it and shit on it all stream it would be a disaster this system will live or die by if twitch gets good deals and takes industry standard percents at least among big streamers with systems in place to aquire sponsors much more likely to be used by streamers that are not getting sponsors other ways due to size not seeking them
if they cared about the community engagement then they could just not take the cut from the gifted subs from said sponsor surely there would be a way to code in an separate way for the sponsor to donate gifted subs that doesn t go through the same system as normal gifted subs surely its just a coincidence they gonna double dip on the gifted subs from the sponsor and surely they just wanted to increase viewer streamer sponsor engagement
it depends twitch already takes a cut from sponsors they provide so say they take of the normally they could take of these deals and give back to the steamer in gift subs in that case twitch only loses compared to the normal situation but the brand gets better engagement for their dollar although i doubt twitch would bite the bullet like that
yup also like when coke coke gaming became a thing meme they were handing out subs and streamers would thank them
or i don t mind watching a streamer say like a two minute spiel if it means they can stream more because they have more money this kind of thing can make the difference between part and full time for smaller streamers
its a business they have to make money its not a charity organization to please sanctusdominus while he sits on his couch and watches hot tub streams since you re a smartguy and seemingly so versed in business and know exactly what twitch is doing wrong lets here your ideas how can they monetize their platform to also include small streamers
honestly this is the based take i think investing in bezos has more value to humankind than degenerate streamers who sit at home all day and live stream it
again what would have initially been money that goes to the streamer now goes to twitch and the streamer again you re ignoring the fact that currently streamers don t get of that money most of the time already if twitch takes is it any different from if any other agency take the only difference is that here it s twitch and people have a hate boner for it regardless of what they do you can argue that the streamer has additional filters and cuts before it gets to the actual talent but it is still less money going to the end destination not necessarely if twitch is the one negociating with brands they may be able to attract more money overall than if individual streamers or agents go to contact them so if a brand only used to spend like idk 100k a month on sponsorship on twitch now twitch might convince them to spend 500k so even if they were to take a cut that s still more money overall for creators it s a net positive also i am curious how smaller streamers would benefit from this they get a larger cut of the streamer portion of the cash but that portion is still being slashed currently small streamers literally don t get access to sponsorship money most of the time because they re not worth the time for agencies and talent managers etc to negociate deals for them if twitch does it at a massive scale for streamers with ccv they all get the chance to make money they couldn t get access to before so yes smaller streamers would benefit from this where the only people possibly losing anything are the big ones and that s only if they do lose something they may also win in the end
what would have initially been money that goes to the streamer now goes to twitch and the streamer now goes to twitch and the streamer and the audience indirectly via subs some people are gonna be into that idgaf either way but you re missing a key point there
if the streamer doesn t like the offer than just don t do it who cares nothing is affected and they can continue to get sponsorships via alternative means
not only is it unlikely that that happens if i m a brand i d probably be pivoting my sponsorship money to the new system i m getting more audience engagement for the same dollar spent it makes more sense for brands to use this new system too all in all seems like twitch found a nice way to stick their fingers into sponsorship money
my alternative would be to not watch streams anymore and stop supporting the platform i am some random guy on the internet i do not have these answers lmao you need to touch grass
bazid
if twitch takes is it any different from if any other agency take except it looks like twitch is taking about according to what charlie has said about the current bounty system so yes it is pretty different from agencies orgs that take a much smaller cut he said the average is about so if you re at then twitch s cut could be 5x bigger than with an agency org he s talked about this issue a lot seeing as he owns an esports org moist and a management agency human media group i also doubt twitch is suddenly going to be more generous with their share considering they ve been heading the opposite direction with recent decisions they ve been growing more aggressive with monetization
okay you don t get of your paycheck since you pay taxes give me half you can send it in i was going to make a joke with a fake name of a crypto currency but it probably would be real to an address i will give in private x200b i mean if twitch streamers can t complain about making less money because they already don t get everything neither can you x200b as for the rest if twitch is actually negotiating better contracts with sponsors to mean that talent see no difference in revenue then i am all for it until twitch stops doing that i would go buy some sponsorships but i hear there is a really good deal on a bridge that i want to go for first x200b and ignoring that this won t change the types of streamers who are eligible for this i also suggest you do some research on how sponsorships and bounties work or just continue to talk out of your ass until big daddy bezos notices you
uhm thanks for being honest and not at all pretending this benefits small streamers and just admitting you want a slightly higher chance at a free sub
thats not a solution you re the type of guy who spends his entire day finding problems with things and has no actual ideas or solutions himself whine whine whine but cant explicitly say what direction he wants to see the platform go
clip mirror xqc on people paying for of content https://arazu.io/t3_12e789v/)** this is an automated comment
man in glass house calls a drone strike on his own location
i m sorry i respect all creators i do i just think that subbing to twitch streamers is one of the most degenerational action of mankind it is one of the most deliberate life backpeddling progress hindering brain rotting activity that anyone has ever come up with
if theres anything more degenerate than paying for of its subsidizing the lives of year old manchildren for 16x16 emotes and a badge
does he think of is the first site to ever charge for porn this is nothing new
let s be honest though live streaming is not far off you have these streamers going for hours a day and chatters somehow find the time to watch all of it it s about moderation i don t think subscribing to of is bad if you re just using it for your own pleasure here and there but once you become a parasocial andy then you ve gone too far same with streaming don t become someone who s life revolves around a weird dude on the internet
porn will always be around and i d much rather the money from it be in the hands of the creators and not in an ancient industry that takes advantage of and abuses countless people
lil bro forgot he also has subscribers that pay for his content even tho they could access it for free
people don t pay for of for content they pay for a fake relationship same reason a lot of people pay for twitch subs
what s degenerate is grinding luck on children s game for record you can t beat
i would pay for forsen s of
thank you degenerate gambling addict hypocrite harold for your opinion on how i should spend my money
bro is saying this while he has 72k people doing the exact same thing for him lulw
lmao ill never get streamers that shit on of creators like you both are in the business of selling parasocial relationships to mostly men that are increasingly more isolated from the irl world only difference is one makes you laugh the other makes you nut there s no moral high ground when you fish in the same pound
never understood the people who criticize of subs if you enjoy something you support it i feel paying for twitch subs feels more meaningless and dumb at least in of you get a quick wank lol
life backpedaling progress hindering brain rotting activity yeah i dont like mincraft speedrunning either
said the streamer
you know what s even more degenerational subbing to xqc on twitch it s one of the most deliberate life backpedaling profess hindering brain rotting activity that anyone has eve to come up with see sounds really stupid right cus it s the same thing
you know damn well he s subbed to clamouranth
he s right but people donating to him now is sort of the same thing
or you can just look up leaks instead of paying
cope comments
whataboutism in this comment section is crazy it makes me think all lsf frogs are paying for of or just hate xqc don t be a degenerate paying for of and subbing to streamers
sex work is not real work forsenbased
lol these comments are crazy they actually defending subbing to of while critizing subbing to a twitch streamer lsf in a nutshell
if i found someone on of who was insanely attractive to me i d just sub for a month and download all the shit i like lol edit i sub to an of before subbing to xqc everytime lol
i d say gambling is worse and onlyfans comes in a close second
so he believes all porn should be free all that leaked of content exist because people paid for it to be made who is gonna wanna make porn if there s no monetary incitement this dude is aiming for the world record on dogshit takes it seems
i use prime sub but i imagine people that pay for subs do it as a form of appreciation for hours of livestreaming content per month i personally don t feel that s in the same ballpark of degeneracy as paying for only fans and having someone send personalised messages and interactions knowing they don t give a single thought towards you in their day for some reason this is apparently a hot take lol

man who spends thousands of dollars per spin in a stake crypto casino hosted in a sketchy country with no regulations thinks people using once a month to see some boobs is bad
at least on onlyfans you get something subbing or donating to a streamer gets you nothing kekw
u are massive basketball fan how do you justify being in love with people putting basketball in the same basket times a game for the millionth time what progress are you making by that what brain activity are you promoting its all entertainment just take it for it is without trying to be above it and try make it tick all your checkboxes
xqc subs agreeing with his take not realizing they re worse is iconic
you missed the entire point
supporting someone who provides you entertainment for free is nowhere near as bad as paying someone for pornographic material of themselves and often with personalisation
i do it for the ads i can t stand em
of clearly has a strong parasocial element to it
i thought of was more for the girlfriend experience but idk i guess it is just porn
it s not about that it s about paying for some illusory relationship and porn on top of that
lil bro spends tens of thousands of dollars on rare video game skins but can t comprehend people paying to see rare exclusive nudity
theyre both the same
subbing to of is more degenerate
if you are a tier sub you get a link to it also the tier streams where he just finished playing hollow knight after he finished playing ac black flag next he said he was going to a short irl stream im not supposed to tell this to the non tier otherwise you would know
regain coomer
bro how db are you that ur spending money on onlyfans
this is sarcastic right
you seem to think that xqc would disagree lmao
literally two different analogies but go on
have you ever heard what a comparison is
weird flex
heyyy dont say that look at this emote xqcl
thats not true there s a chance he might say your video game name out loud
well thats also just wrong though subbing to a streamer gets you no ads channel specific badge and emotes usable across the whole website
i m sorry i respect all redditors i do i just think that this comment by u letranger is one of the most degenerational action of mankind it is one of the most deliberate life back pedaling progress hindering brainrotting activity that anyone has ever come up with
u are massive basketball fan how do you justify being in love with people putting basketball in the same basket times a game for the millionth time what progress are you making by that what brain activity are you promoting its all entertainment just take it for it is without trying to be above it and try make it tick all your checkboxes u letranger this dude just serious posted a shit post
surely this is ironic
whats worse for me is the people who spend all their time in their streamers community i get its wholesome and cool that you all like the same thing but surely you could be doing anything else than spamming in an offline chat
they re worse u trolling right nothing in terms of subbing is literally worse than subbing to of lol
what exactly is bad about pornographic material you re agreeing with a guy that gambles literal millions and somehow you dont see the irony
atrioc seems to know more about this for sure
the word parasocial doesn t exist outside of this subreddit
web cam girls have existed for how long come on now get this puritanical shit out of here of isn t new or pushing any boundary
some onlyfans girls reply to their subs messages so those girls are definitely selling the girlfriend experience
exclusive nudes bruh it ain t exclusive if its
i m not sure what you re reading but i never said that i have spent money on onlyfans what i m saying is that the manchild whose gambling addiction is supported by 14yos shouldn t talk about other people s financial decisions
its thanks to those who sub that i can get it for free
please explain what the difference is in both instances you re giving someone money cus you enjoy their content so please do explain
you re rights it s even crazier you don t even get a quick pull to one so many ways to bypass giving money to a multi millionaire to not see ads but gift donate sub to this one is crazier than of lol
xqc no shot he would ever acknowledge a sub i prefer it that way tbh
i didn t know i paid to watch nba games on tv that s pretty fuckin wild
i feel like it s a copy pasta
why does anyone care how anyone spends their time
so you think giving a multimillionaire money isn t as bad as donating to some girl to see her butthole
getting nudes getting access to a pixel dumbass emote to spam mindlessly with predetermined timing along with other idiots and feeling a sense of accomplishment when they spam the same thing as you while giving a literal multi millionaire
wtf is the relation between a millionaire gambling millions and lonely lsf user like u subbing to of girl lol
look man sometimes you just start clicking on ads on porn sites and go down this rabbit hole and next thing you know you re jerking off to your famous streamer friends deepfakes you can t explain that
paying for both is degen but of has clearly exploded to levels no one expected
yeah but more exclusive than free is the point
you seemed like you got mad defensive over it
i feel paying for twitch subs feels more meaningless and dumb what s that have to do with this subbing to a twitch streamer for free is more meaningless and dumb than subbing to of girl not free
it s even dumber to sub to a streamer because their content isn t paywalled
nowadays it is incredibly hard to avoid ads on twitch its a hassle to constantly find new extensions that work with twitch i d rather just use my prime
no but fans pay much more to go to live games
i don t really care its not like i ever go into an offline chat but i know these people exist and i just think its weird people on this thread are just calling subs degens which i agree but i also think theres more degenerate things to do
gambling is literally the biggest money waste you could ever do with it the odds are literally against you and you literally cannot win in the long run how is that not a worst waste
the point is it s ok for of to exist but the act of using it has great negative effects for the user both mentally and financially the same as gambling so the use of it shouldn t be illegal but frowned upon
here s a few more for you
subbing to a twitch streamer for free uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
since when subbing in twitch is free what are you on about prime its not free you are paying an amazon subscription what are you even talking about are you
bro thinks he s xqc do you think that u are x that u can waste millions like him a million to him is like a to an lsf lonely user who sub to of like u lol so it is a worst waste for you but not to him
who s point is that does that apply to all paid porn pornhub premium playboy magazines fifty shades of grey i understand porn addiction i just don t see how of is especially bad but i don t use it so i guess idk
hes arguing for xqc what do you think
damn youre pretty sad
both you really need to reevaluate your life choices that brought you to a subreddit about millionares arguing about which millionaire deserves your money more

sorry nick that is awful
that s called the giggle loop
5head nick farming dead grandma for lsf clicks
my grandma told me i have n word hair when i was a kid cuz i had an afro
even though cinna is a bit far right as far as her politics she seems pretty cool
whaddya gonna do at least she didn t suffer
weirdos not funny lil bros
cinna really couldn t control her laughter there huh sign of a bad person ngl no empathy she hides it well tho seems nice but that s next level
i guess he was only telling cinna because emily sure wasn t listening
great guy nevurmeddum
everyday for a summer
made me think of that shit right away bobby is the goat
i remember watching that when it first aired and crying laughing only time tfatk even incidentally was funny same stuff with some of bobby lees first podcasts with ethan klein they talk at one point about hating themselves so much as kids and bobby says somethjng like he spat at his own reflection in the mirror and it had me rolling the level of self loathing admittedly a lot for comic effect but still
knew this would be in the comments
damn what a coincidence youtube has been recommending me a ton of shorts with this guy and out of nowhere i see him here
nosotros papaya
this is all i could think of when i was watching the clip
love bobby to death though he did admit fairly recently on one of his podcasts that he exaggerated alot of this story and lied about parts like a regular comedian does still a funny bit though and one of his classics
bro i feel so betrayed https://youtu.be/zww73otxrfo?t=819
my mom passed away a week ago i m super temped to send this to my niece because it would make her laugh she acts the same way
wtf
how donators expect streamers to react when they donate their entire lifes sob story
they call that corpsing now i know why rip grandma
is that really normal tho if a friend did that to me that s a big no no
this comment was brought to you by otknetwork ad
check her stream with squeex and simply if you like those as well
yeah otk has done an amazing job at finding good smaller streamers and elevating them
i think emily has been on nicks quite a few times
steve o actually seems like a good person though
how is she far right
this is the most terminally online thing ive read in a long time you realize people in the real world can disagree and be friends is it just me jesust
violently throwing up likely a serious head injury sounds miserable to me
for calling out a lack of empathy classic
i agree not funny at all my grandma fell down the stairs hilarity ensues
talmbout getting molested b
if you wanted to molest me you got me brother
every day you couldn t avoid him
brutally falling down the stairs
bobby lee is one of the few people who can say the most fucked shit and still make me laugh
watching those podcasts at work made them even funnier i couldn t laugh too loud so i was crying so hard trying to hold my laughter
you have an issue with people paying respects to a deceased grandma
yeah i know i meant that is when i first saw her i think it was a car stream it is a great oppotunity when these smaller streamers get to colaborate with bigger streamers
what do mean steve o stapled his ass cheeks together he s an american hero
is cinna not is that just a joke about her laughing in this clip or did she do something that i m out of the loop on
they are joking people send her trump merch and joke she s part of the latinos for trump she s neither republican nor latino
prob coz she s not far left
you guys don t get the joke because you all don t watch cinna
lmao it s a joke it would be also wild for a half black white and japanese woman that looks latino to be far right it s just detrimental to life with the amount of bills passed by the right that are intended to disenfranchise both communities that s the joke
just some cheeky referential humor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onrqzw_cmou)

clip mirror xqc says that he confirmed the wire transfer and a half days ago to the valorant team https://arazu.io/t3_12df9ve/)** this is an automated comment
i don t think anybody seriously thought he would just lie and ruin his reputation over spins
there are people really out here thinking transferring large sums of money would be an instant thing
anyone have an overview of the drama here i m ootl
how did this gain so much traction when basically nothing happened why was this not handled privately
wait sorry i ve been out of the loop because i work hrs a week so your saying these guys got paid just because x felt bad after negotiations fell through i wish this is how my job worked some of these comments seem to forget reality i m sure no other company s would have gone through paying for nothing i m assuming since x is a single entity he can just pay them without some crazy board approval that s really nice of him wow i don t think organizations are going to want to work with them given the harsh comments at the hand that was trying to feed them sadge
how i see it x dodged a bullet on this contract seeing how these so called pros act
maybe i m getting old but this lil bro shit is annoying af did zoomers suddenly reduce their entire vocabulary to w l lil bro
i mean if the players were that good somebody else would pick them up or would have already tried right i can t imagine any org would want to deal with them after all of this they re tier pros and not even the best in tier
honestly xqc has a weak memory and little responsibility if he owed me money i would probably too try to try to make a successful lsf post just in case he forgets because he checks lsf more often than his mails
this valorant team seems to only want to point fingers good luck getting anyone else to deal with you in the future
lsf doesn t care lil bro xqc is literally the devil and any negative clip about him should be trusted with evidence and massive hatethreads should be made
bruh the hate boner a lot of people on lsf have against xqc is mind boggling this time is over bunch of immature pros that they think they re entitled to anything here which they don t the money they ll get it s not owed to them rather out of x s good well trying to manipulate farm sympathy by not understanding or ignoring on purpose what a term sheet is which s a nonbinding agreement that shows the basic terms and conditions of an investment serves as a template and basis for more detailed legally binding documents go touch some grass maybe be more productive with your time instead of hating for no reason on this issue
but the narrative won t somebody please think of the narrative
i would never do a business deal with this valorant team if this is how they act publicly regarding business contracts
esports players and bitching about payment time this is a real classic
but but this doesn t fit into the narrative
imagine if other people paying someone any salary after backing out of something that wasn t right
my question is why did all of these streamers suddenly decide it was time to invest into esports teams like they all decided to do it all around the same time like they have secret streamer meetings of what kind of content or investments they should all pursue
he also stated on the stream that he wasn t obligated to pay them any money but he did cause he felt it s the right thing to do for their time loss
seeing posts like this always reminds me that the name of this subreddit is completely fucking unrelated
it like all lsf never know deals like this are nuclear the only bad thing is that they took it public x didnt do anythig wrong it his money and he can pull the plug anytime if you think otherwise your dumb
thank god i was losing so much sleep over this
clip mirror xqc says that he confirmed the wire transfer and a half days ago to the valorant team https://livestreamfails.com/clip/152614)** this is an automated comment feedback http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=livestreamfailsbot&amp;subject=feedback:&amp;message=%5bpost%5d\(https://reddit.com/comments/12df9ve/\)) twitch backup mirror https://production.assets.clips.twitchcdn.net/41_prjuuvdgj7cb_8w2gfa/at-cm%7c41_prjuuvdgj7cb_8w2gfa.mp4?sig=8f18b45ee5284f936c29c768dfad003ca4cf76c0&token=%7b%22authorization%22%3a%7b%22forbidden%22%3afalse%2c%22reason%22%3a%22%22%7d%2c%22clip_uri%22%3a%22https%3a%2f%2fproduction.assets.clips.twitchcdn.net%2f41_prjuuvdgj7cb_8w2gfa%2fat-cm%257c41_prjuuvdgj7cb_8w2gfa.mp4%22%2c%22device_id%22%3anull%2c%22expires%22%3a1680848857%2c%22user_id%22%3a%22%22%2c%22version%22%3a2%7d)
my juicer aint a bad guy
no contract no issues i would assume the wire was a retention fee for their time in most cases you wouldn t even have to pay that even a verbal agreement isn t much let s be real did he even have a team to write up the contracts people expecting x to be professional is on copium the man can barely function as a adult let alone a owner of a team
removed
why are professional video game neckbeards expecting to be paid like professional athletes who is consuming this in the real world
so how explain to bit is it true he still working doing build up for valorant turtle troops team since he s facing lot going on even thought his team gonna compete in upcoming split in april for vct challenger in na
does x not have a business manager that helps him handle this stuff
rich commie sad lsf upset xqc
xqc frogs out in mad numbers rn y all dumb asf for simping this hard to a literal man child
he could really use a manager to manage his manageable items so he doesn t mismanage anything important with his poor management skills
the main issue isn t about the payment it s about ghosting the team entirely for those of you unfamiliar with the situation it s not like xqc is purchasing the team from a corporation or anyone these players are currently playing for free typically team sheets will include details such as length of contract and salary imagine people players and coach not having a job and not knowing how to pay rent next month a company comes in and gives you a job offer when you reach out to the company to accept their offer the company ghosts you entirely as well this happened over a month ago he just transferred the money a day and a half ago after ghosting them for weeks
amerifats not having free instant wire transfers edit amerifats downvoting
this steam was the most chronically stunlocked over ever seen xqc holy lmao my man went into minutes of silence just to unmute and keep ranting lmao
surely he s not gonna just wire transfer the money now to save face after lying about it
almost like he didnt send the money but is doing it now to save face lul
any lore masters can break down this situation i m not following
ahhh wire
this valorant team lost all future possibilities of collab with xqc after how they responded
ruin his reputation with who juicers won t care and will blame the other party and other streamers will give him a pass because of his view count
surely lsf will not side with the lying valorant pros cuz of some bullshit narrative and wait for things to get resolved instead of jumping into conclusions xqc bad am i right
it s closer to crazy time bet
they said it was only for half a month so spins
you would be surprised
i dont think it s that anyone thought he d ruin his rep its the fact he even has to be called out about it in the first place and that he s only following through on it because he got called out for it x definitely fucked up by not communicating at any level regardless of whether or not the team was happening you dont just up and no show completely to the whole ordeal then only after you get caught for it do the right thing thats pretty fucked honestly
ruin his reputation by lying it s not lying most people thought he was joking which is completely different
just venmo me 25k bro
it literally is in a lot of countries transferred 15k the other day and was basically instant if i remember correctly the slowest option we tend to have in the uk nowadays can take up to day but most use a system that is max hours but is normally within seconds minutes
idk man my 25k is approved to arrive at my broker s account in days max and disappears in days as well
it is in europe
but it is in a good chunk of of the world i can hop on my online banking and send someone 100k right now if i want and they d have it pretty much instantly you may trigger an anti fraud system with a large payement and get a call from your bank to confirm it s actually you and not someone trying to steal your money but it s all instant once they know it s actually you i have no idea how the us canda as well is so backwards slow in certain ways when it comes to their banking having to use a third party app service like venmo etc to send receive money instantly is crazy
yeah because when you tranfer money you need to ghost the people you tranfer that money
it is in first world countries
do you really expect valorant players to have a working logical train of thought all they have in mind is wether to dodge or insult a female player
how large are we talking i ve bank transferred instantly for a deposit before
exactly my bank even contacted me over a 1k charge let alone 25k going to an account he s most likely never sent money to before
this is unironically why i still use crypto sometimes can send any amount you want in a few minutes for a few bucks to anyone in the world i don t fuck with all the scams and nfts i just use it for money transfer obviously i m not saying xqc should have done this in this scenario though
wire transfer in lmao
people here never had to transfer more than in their lives so makes sense
the title says wire transfer which is same day so yea
same i haven t watched cause i always see playing minecraft lol
ikr same here didn t think anything about this drama didn t even bother to watch the clips or read any comments and now we re here with posts hitting the front page i guess this guy summed it up pretty well https://old.reddit.com/r/livestreamfail/comments/12df9ve/xqc_says_that_he_confirmed_the_wire_transfer_1/jf7gaak/)
deleted
xqc ghosts valorant team after signing term sheets with them https://www.reddit.com/r/livestreamfail/comments/12czstb/xqc_ghosted_valorant_team_after_signing_term/) it turns out that he couldn t afford it but he was too embarrassed to say anything so he just dipped but he paid them 25k for their time https://www.reddit.com/r/livestreamfail/comments/12czstb/xqc_ghosted_valorant_team_after_signing_term/) then there s another video of them saying they never got 25k
because the pros couldn t stop themselves from bitching about it on stream for whatever reason people are so entitled to everything these days it s crazy just a few years ago i had to wait like days for even small payments yet these people somehow expect to get 5k in what a day and a half lmao
there s some people here that can t wait to cancel xqc cuz he did upset their streamer that one time or something edit this guy u slampy15 is just one example of the people i m talking about
because the pros are entitled brats
because lsf loves drama and people without clout know that same shit happened with everyone condemning otk for paying their wow team s contracts and then dropping them after it ended but they were friends and said this would be a long term thing even when it had no viewers or sponsor interest honestly every streamer bitches about shit behind the scenes x is no stranger problem is people just think they need to be a personal army whenever a business deal is not handled professionally by people who play games for a living let them bitch let them handle it let it be dropped and move on once they do
slow news cycle
because they are thinking xqc owns money which in contract he doesn t own them shit he can walk and don t pay but he still feel bad wasting their time pay them 25k half of the month
theres both sides too it xqcs choices in life have caused him to make eratic and sporatic decisions like buying a valo team getting everyone hyped having them gain hope knowing they will be paid alot and then ripping it all away because he didnt realize how expensive valorant teams were like i a basic human bitch know how expensive they are the valo pros are also whining but with the continued misscommunication and lack of do you really blame them they were told they were going to get money and when someone asked themn they said they recieved no money which isnt a lie
because there s no drama and x takes his image very very seriously
yes this team essentially had a job interview and didn t get the job this happens all the time i guess this sub is years old and just learning it and they even still got paid well for their time during this process really weird they would complain publicly about this not a good look for them
u iloveapples01 lil bro you missed the hate thread go back to your drama farming discord server
classic valorant players
seeing how these so called pros act lol wtf do you think they said
are you actually stupid
what all of these people are immature asf including xqc if xqc is being immature and ghosting then you can t be mad at them having an immature response
daddy chill
get off the internet lil bro the grass smells nice today
l lil bro
yes
they probably have his manager s contact info and shit could have checked in with him before bitching about it on lsf
honestly you really think he handles this stuff himself when he has a team
there s a reason they re one of the last to be signed now everyone will be watching this next split to see if x really saved himself some money
jfc the fuck do all you guys think he said governor gets asked a random question about the xqc deal from a friend he is duoing with governor xqc ghosted us after we signed a term sheet i haven t received any money xqc yep i communicated horribly and essentially ghosted we had a difference in ideas and i decided not to continue the partnership money is on the way lsf smh idiot valorant team burning bridges
here comes u iloveapples01 the drama farmer trying to both sides this just the same way he did trying to defend adapter when she was suing the juicer for bullshit reasons too i might add
no but a person on the team told his side of it which was true to his knowledge he hasn t received any money and xqc did ghost them that brought reasonable criticism sometimes the only way companies police rich fucks do the right thing is when they re pressured publicly xqc literally sent the cash like yesterday lol only logical that someone somewhere was going to complain
xqc is literally the devil and any negative clip about him should be trusted with evidence and massive hatethreads should be made xqc isn t the devil but it is kinda hilarious how you are actually describing exactly what xqc and his community do to other streamers when he s beefing
he s not the devil just incredibly annoying it s understandable that most people here don t like him or his community
sez u am i right juicer
business contracts what contract though
as if you d ever be in that situation lmao
what narrative most of the comments in the last thread were saying it probably was just taking time shit only had like a comments too why do you have a victim complex for another person lol
vc money running dry for some orgs raising capital is probably hard right now with the recent economic downturn in the us major sponsorship ad opportunities also running dry notice how sponsor streams the past couple months have been relatively few compared to the last year or two because theres just less ad money going around in general when the economy isnt doing well tl dr streamers are a good market to pull in more vc money at a cheaper time to invest
cause e sports in the us is trending downwards so people in the industry are trying to find ways to drive engagement and alot of investors are looking for an out so they look at these big influencers their huge amounts of money and followers and they try to rope them into it
defending so you misinformation subject and make hate comment you want the don t people to say the anything truth you are wired person get some help that level of hate is insane not good you
so problem

good one lulw
what is this what happened
the cop is going to ask the guy if he s watching french cartoons
inciting riots like he did that one time that white house
how parasocial are his fans
that lawyer clip where the kid pulls a gun and say anything for him is crazyy
shootas huh
adept might use this clip in court the juicer with the gun and the juicer in jubilee to show the judge he got shootas everywhere
eventually people started getting arrested to be on cops and live pd just for attention so if xqc keeps up with enough live crime this will happen and i will be watching
imagine a high speed chase on the highway when the sunroof opens to reveal an xqcl
i honestly thought thats what was coming next after a suspect in a live chase tried one of x s rp strats and tried acting like a normal civilian after getting caught
good thing theyre finally prosecuting x for all horrible things he did can t believe he made prerecorded streams before being arrested
perhaps wrong person or just hearing the voices again
i think you re mixing up xqc with squeex it s an understandable mistake since both their names have an x and a q
xqc inciting riots what who hit you

clip mirror moistcr1tikal says once his contract with twitch is over he will multistream to other platforms most notably youtube https://arazu.io/t3_12d8e31/)** this is an automated comment
if youtube actually gave shits about showing livestreams his viewer count would probably be insane just based off his youtube views
i always wondered why the fuck is he streaming on twitch while he has 10m subs on yt
shit twitch streamers say to get a better twitch contract
dude could make a video of him farting into a microphone and still get 1m views on youtube he ll be fine wherever he goes
famous youtuber streaming on youtube cool
he has a very active yt community so there s little to no risk to it probably the most out of anyone that could switch from twitch
i imagine the vast majority of people on twitch will switch to do you lose your sub button if you multi stream if yes then only the large streamers with large youtube channels can make the switch without losing revenue any smaller streamer say less then viewers without a youtube following is probably not going to switch
id rather watch people on youtube they just need to fix whatever the fuck youtube gaming is i genuinely get very mad at thinking about the uncapitalized upon potential youtube has had for the like years with making a good livestream platform to overtake twitch with ontop of just being youtube
i wonder how many viewers he d get on a yt stream his channel is insane
i wonder if he ll read both chats or if youtube chat is going to be completely ignored
i think the doc said since he s gone to youtube he gets of what he got when he was on twitch
i don t blame him given his size he ll be okay but for smaller viewership streamers it s still a challenge in the end you gotta cast a wider net if you want to increase your odds so multistreaming helps and twitch still does fuck all to better promote their streamers besides the big ones which those guys still don t get a lot from that
hell yes more charlie with his beautiful hair everywhere
feel like with the new ad requirements and everything is the streamer really streaming content anymore or just ads makes sense that content creators streamers who put their viewers first would rather give their viewers a better experience than to make a little bit more money especially after the splits also moist s audience is so vast that it makes sense for him since he has a footprint on both platforms it would only increase his numbers
we don t care
there is almost no reason to not multistream fuck twitchs exclusivity shit hope this inspires others to do the same

make sense most of his fanbase only watch his youtube channel and don t even know he streams on twitch
i mean whatever it takes to secure the bag before people get tired of watching people react to videos of themselves
i just wish there was an easy way to find live streams on youtube
i still for the life of me cant understand why they got rid of exclusivity clauses in partner contracts kick would never be a thing if they still had that clause
to be able to spool a stream back and catch up on what i missed is so brilliant on youtube twitch is more cumbersome i also dont like the world im entering when i go to twitch it feels non inclusive i m old and i feel like im watching a streamer i like but i have to see tits and asses everywhere on the homepage to get to them as a streamer it s a very clique club which makes it very hard to get anywhere unless you comply with the club and get approved by them in colabs etc
i hope more twitch viewers will learn how superior the youtube player is the chat and notification system for livestreams is horrible but the player is a
honestly idc much moist has good takes most of the time but most of his content value is in youtube anyways he s a pretty boring monotone streamer imo
and this matters
kick com trainwreckstv
well duh business is business
nah moist is gonna go kick to finally use his toys
if you have a big yt following its kinda a no brainer you just end up looking more popular to said algorithm which becomes a self fulfilling prophecy especially if you can get into the shorts algorithm too
wow shocking ad revenue from yt probably makes up the vast majority of his income
let s fuckin go
when does his contract run out anyone know
i ve always been ok with streamers moving away from twitch twitch has been moving in a direction where they don t care for the streamer anymore it s become negative towards streamers to take deals now from twitch and i m pretty sure twitch is gonna be making offers for a lot of them to stay
if youtube doesn t find the bag sign a successful youtuber who has an esport burning his revenue i call it corporate negligence
he should have been doing that in the first place you have millions of followers on your main platform why would you then sign an exclusive contract with twitch he probably lost money on this current deal
wtf is that username omegalul
he streamed on youtube before twitch and was consistently doing even back in like
in a dusty grimy filth ridden room charlie wakes up on the floor seemingly tortured by a dearth of both sleep and sustenance surrounding him empty cans of divine peach g fuel and used bags of cheetos are among the detritus he has not showered in days weeks perhaps a solitary yellow stained lightbulb creaks from its string as it gently but deliberately sways back and forth from the ceiling dimly illuminating the bronze table above him charlie barely manages to muster the strength to sit on the rusted iron stool beside him he slowly begrudgingly leers at the table his hulking frame nearly eclipsing the sole light source now behind him a decision a plan perhaps pondered over too patiently but he is a professional a master of his craft the flies like an aura around him are a reminder he is in his element this is familiar territory he reaches both cheeto encrusted hands forward with a confidence that masquerades his hesitance and just before grasping that which lies in front of him he pulls back under the immense weight of the prospect of finality in his unmade decision he weeps the kind of sob one experiences when having to choose between the life of their own children hours pass he awakens barely yet still propped on the stool his head unhurriedly rises from his arms sprawled out on the table beneath them again he fixes his gaze ahead but this time he is confident he reaches out grasps his choice then stands assertively his decision has been made he walks toward the solitary rusted steel door and passes the still swaying light with a firm muscular grip on his decision in his arms three moby huge dildos one in purple one in red and the last rainbow coloured he finally reaches the door and opens it as the door opens he is enveloped in a blinding light this is the first sunlight the man has seen in years perhaps ever yet again he weeps except these were not tears of sorrow no they were tears of joy relief and excitement exhilarated he steps into the light life rediscovered
depends on streamers some literally double their viewership if their youtube content is popular and i think charlie will do well youtube actually gave shits about showing livestreams they do if you are subbed and shedules appear in sub box so they are shown and with charlies sub count it will be shown to many people
i have no idea why youtube not implement such easy thing just show a one live page of people you follow
it s baffling how shit it is to find a livestream on youtube if your not subscribed you have zero way of even know there streaming and even then it s just indicated by a red dot zero notifications on phone or anything
but why should youtube give shits about livestreams they already dominate the vtuber scene and that is literally all they need
that doesn t always translate to live viewership on youtube
some years ago he did stream on youtube then he moved to twitch
i kinda like that he straddles both platforms he gets paid to react on twitch and then chops that up for youtube videos
monetization twitch prime and gifted subs are great monetization tools youtube doesn t have anything similar to twitch prime and just recently got gifted memberships concurrent viewers feed the ego but aren t a to indicator of money made
he would go crazy on youtube iivestream wise prob average like 40k at least i imagine especially if he does react content or his live drama review stuff
just because you have a high sub count it doesn t equate to viewership pewdiepie back when he was insanely huge didn t get insane viewership on youtube
because youtube sucks for streaming and twitch doesnt
creators want to be diversified across as many platforms as possible for both reach and security
most of the comments in the reply section are just missing critical information he talked about this way back but basically the support for streaming on youtube is absolutely abyssmal he already had millions of subs back then even for a bigger youtuber like him he tried streaming on twitch and noticed how much faster he would get a respond from the support team compared to youtube that was when he decided to move forward with twitch as his main streaming platform and it has been that way ever since
apparently twitch is no longer offering streamers contracts which is why we are seeing more and more people multi stream since they are no longer exclusively tied to twitch
i dont think twitch are really giving out contracts right now there is no competition the most money right now is on twitch even without a contract why would twitch give out contracts when no one else is yt stopped as they are focusing on shorts fb is dead kick is only offering equity for non exclusive deals if that the correct play is to multi stream and expand your revenue growth model with no commitments to a platform
well big ones can afford to double stream as youtube takes a lot smaller cut plus better ad cut
he was originally streaming on youtube with little to no success his streaming career blew up when he switched to twitch i would say partly because he started interacting with other twitch streamers
seriously i don t think a lot of people are aware that he started streaming on youtube and would always shit on twitch claiming youtube was the better platform but when twitch offered him the bag he took it and started streaming on there now of course when the contract is up he ll take advantage and stream on both
any smaller streamer say less then viewers without a youtube following is probably not going to switch agreed twitch is still the money maker for streaming unless your a pretty big content creator and twitch knows this and its why they are not dolling out contracts anymore like they used to
you can be an affiliate and not be partnered you keep a sub button but you lose bonus ad packages and don t have direct lines to twitch all in all being partnered lost most of its benefits
the small ones are the ones who benefit most from switching twitch is the worst platform to grow on
someone with average viewers is like the top of twitch
they just dont care thats the truth look at how fast they pushed out youtube shorts and how well presented it is on the front page
if they made youtube streaming as easy to navigate as twitch as easy to find new shit to watch categories it d pop off they re just behind the times lazy as fuck with making it work
i guess you are alone i d never want to watch a streamer on youtube
he used to stream there years ago during the fortnite days usually only to a couple thousand but yea these days he might pull big numbers if youtube doesn t hide streams like they seem to do
ltt podcast already gets 3x the viewers on yt than on twitch i think if you re a yt creator first and foremost you d do way better livestreaming on yt
multistream services usually have a an option to combine chats restream https://restream.io/chat) the service ninja uses used does that
that s because the ban damaged his reputation lost opportunities and sponsors and not because of the revenue from twitch when you google dr disrespect you used to get news articles about his ban and this is something that sponsors don t like
not surprising since he s done and not just on twitch
plus i don t know why they haven t added a dedicated vods tab for youtube kinda like they did for shorts i shouldn t need to find someone s 2nd vod channel and hope they uploaded it just because youtube forces them to delete it if they don t want to drown out all their other videos with vods such a simple thing to add but creates so much hassle without it
they can t require exclusivity without paying them for it and for large streamers who know their worth its expensive
kick isnt a thing lol
cause they don t feel threaten by any competitor just like how they didn t care to go after every big streamer
someone like moist would ve just switched over completely to youtube if twitch wanted full exclusivity without paying him enough for it but now they at least keep him part of the time
and your comment matters
fr what a loser i bet he s not even a real lawyer
hdmi lawyer
don t hate
the what now
i mean they don t really give a shit they don t even give a shit about vtubers they have never helped them grow even though the vtubers have been keeping there dead fucking livestreming service alive since aquaring some big stremers was just for show they want to diversify their income although they are starting to pay more attention to livestreming they will never consider it on the same level as video sharing
i mean he gets millions of views per video even if translate that would be enough
ltt podcast literally has 4x the viewer on youtube for their podcast than their twitch stream
this sub numbers don t even translate to video views he has almost 13m subs and most of his vids are around 5m or pewdiepie most of his vids also get 5m views and he has over 100m sub
i watch him on youtube don t watch his streams and wouldn t watch the streams on youtube either and assume a lot of people would be like that too but i think he can get good viewership on youtube too
i get what you re saying but there s youtubers with similar or even lower sub numbers that streamed for the first time and got 20k pretty easily that s 12m people versus the 4m followers he has on twitch the active twitch viewers will continue watching on top of his youtube viewer base it s a win win no
ludwig averages like 20k a stream with way less notoriety on the platform if charlie took his twitch audience directly to youtube which i know is not the case in this instance and added the youtube viewers he d probably average 30k
maybe not immediately but if he streamed and had his reaction videos uploaded while he s live it would most likely give him a decent boom in viewership
it doesn t really matter if it does the livestream can push the yt content even further in the algo that s what successful yters do typically they drop a yt video at the end of stream looking at the livestream as the way to make money rather than how to make content for other platforms is the difference
apparently twitch is no longer offering streamers contracts depending who you are and probably how big you are on other platforms they did offered cdawgva a contact who is also big on youtube
what about someone like cdawgva then he somewhat recently announced he s staying with team purple exclusively with a whole announcement tweet and video etc
apparently twitch is no longer offering streamers contracts smart because the only people you should offer contracts too are the people getting 50k idk why the fuck anyone got 5k got a exclusive contract
the only reason i still watch twitch vs youtube is solely because discoverability and the fact that most of the people i watch is on twitch if there was a desktop site app that let me watch who was live on youtube or twitch or even kick i would not care which platform they were on at all
they still offer exclusive contracts they probably just mean if you aren t a top dog highly contest streamer like shroud xqc etc etc then you will never be offered an exclusivity contract since many people are saying they are multistreaming to youtube and the change in general is hurting their income also rumor is kick is trying to poach some of twitch s biggest moneymakers they will likely keep the old split for these big boys so they don t get successfully poached
this is such a made up narrative
cdawgva just announced a twitch exclusivity deal a month or two ago so that s not true
it also doesn t help that its impossible to see who is streaming on youtube literally all they have to do is add a youtube streaming part of the site its own link to youtube just make it so you can see popular streamers and search streamers with better notifications if they are on so often i can t tell if someone is streaming if it is a current stream or if they are live but it was a stream from a day ago their website is dogshit if it wasn t they d actually be more competitive with twitch
uhh that s a big streamer lmao
you can t multistream as an affiliate so you wouldn t keep your sub button the agreement https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/affiliate-agreement/) says live content exclusivity solely for any live audio visual work you choose to provide to us as user content your live twitch content starting from beginning of the initial broadcast of any such live twitch content and continuing for a period of twenty four hours following the end of the initial broadcast of such live twitch content the exclusivity period such live twitch content is exclusive to twitch even as to you during the exclusivity period of any live twitch content you will not nor permit or authorize any third party to broadcast stream distribute exhibit and otherwise make available such live twitch content in any manner notwithstanding the foregoing you have the right to make any live twitch content available during the exclusivity period solely via the twitch services after the exclusivity period of any live twitch content the license to such live twitch content will become non exclusive and you will have the right to broadcast stream distribute exhibit and otherwise make available such live twitch content in any manner and format desired by you the initial broadcast means the initial broadcasting streaming distribution or other exhibition of live twitch content via the internet whether such live twitch content is broadcast on a real time live basis as the subject event is occurring or such live twitch content has been prerecorded and is being initially broadcast for the first time via any manner or method of streaming
ok i said smaller streamer not small streamer also someone with viewers may be in the top but they are most definitely a small streamer
live streaming is a niche and not profitable youtube gets way more views with way less overhead with shorts and pre recorded uploads if anything they probably don t want more people live streaming unless they re one of the big fish

didnt this dude just talk shit about hassan watching police chases on stream
that argument years ago about how video games lead to violence seemed so silly at the time but with how fkn stupid people are these days it makes more and more sense soon streamers will be live viewing swedish people jumping into volcanos
those guys have not watched enough gta rp to know how to properly do the npc strat you do it by going to an small alleyway or under bridge after you have catched a bit of a lead and the heli isnt seeing shit you slow down in the alleyway so you can escape safely and you hide behind the corner while the car gets back to its original speed and when the heli sees it it looks like nothing happened
somebody saw fast and furious
bro this and bro that haha lul big w bro
if he had a baseball cap he would ve been gone
ome he tried it
you can literally see a huge helicopter spot light on him not to mention the sound of a dozen cop cars chasing them this guy was cooked
i thought streaming police chases was basically a mortal sin
no he talked about the inconsistency of twitch bans
cop chases have been broadcast live for decades just because your favourite streamers have just started doing it now doesn t mean it s a new thing
he needed a bench to sit on
tried pulling off the jack reacher move for sure https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuqepng8ife)
the funniest part about this is they can see a huge light coming straight from the helicopter that was blocked out by a building at the beginning of the clip so he could have gotten away by getting out while the cam was blocked by the building without being seen by the heli if there wasnt a swarm of cops behind him
under bridge it might work
i wudnt know im not american there s no exciting live chases here for pure sensationalism like live court cases we still have common sense in our country tho im sure soon we ll just be as braindead as the us its just a matter of time
i think irl they would all snitch for sure
the cops aren t getting their location updates from the news helicopter
how are you going to claim you have common sense right after you just tried to make the argument that video games do cause violence that shit is so lacking in common sense it might as well be made of helium
there are both news and police helicopters
sometimes they do
im mostly joking that people are out here playing gta in real life because they re literal braingoblins but come with your ermagurd reaction please
yeah and the police helicopter isn t in the exact same spot the news one is so likely wasn t getting blocked by the building this guy is going on about
the second helicopter the one with the big ass spotlight was also briefly blocked by the building however didn t notice he said the cam was blocked so you re probably right he probably was referring to the news copter that s filming it
pretty sure both the police and the news heli have a camera they were both blocked by the building judging from this pov alone
clip mirror xqc explains why he ghosted the valorant team https://arazu.io/t3_12d36ux/)** this is an automated comment
basically because of his court case he didn t realize he can only spend a certain amount and didn t realize how expensive valorant was he also had a plan to have players stay on the team and try to get really good pros but once he started talking to the really good pros he came to a conclusion it is going to be tough both of these points lead to him running away he still paid 25k to the players as a waiting price and he apologized
translation he got a limit to spend cause of the adabter so he cant buy the team
i ll be honest it kinda makes sense for him to not go through with the tt buyout they placed bottom in their team group xqc had an idea of how he wanted to build the team and tt just wanted to stick together as and still get paid if xqc is the one providing funding he should be able to dictate how the team is managed
tldw a bunch of clips it fell through after some court issue with the hdmi but he still found a way around it and wanted to buy superstars to make the team win it all but the team wouldnt budge and not go with what he wanted so he changed his mind about it all still paid them above market for the supposed time that was lost even though he didnt need to since no contracts were signed his team let the players know about it all as well
damn kinda sad he can t speak his mind because of the court case
tldr ghost emojicon

fastest lsf comment switch up in history
it shouldn t even be this big of a deal on here to begin with he never signed any contract or anything a lot of companies will do this exact thing it s not that uncommon
in short fuck adept
holy hell hdmi is still fucking things over for him
deleted
i wonder if lsf will be nice now or will they still make him the villain
if his mangers didn t communicate with the team properly then he needs to get better managers simple as i can t believe there was this much miscommunication between xqc s people and the val team a simple email could have avoided this entire thing
ghost emoji moment classico
just sign forsen
ghost
why can t he spend a certain amount of money when it s his money i never understood that part of the case that s a little too controlling that chick does not even have a high school diploma
but i thought we already knew why it was because xqc is a scumbag piece of shit who does this to everyone according to lsf maybe that s why u wait before you make hate threads with no information
lsf wrong once again edit the witch hunters in the other thread seem very silent now i wonder what happened
lsf people malding in silence now cuz he gave a reasonable explanation lmfao
i m sorry because of the court case he s been limited for how much money he can spend from money he earns
i m really trying not to make any generalisations but my god most people on this reddit really need to step up their game surely the majority of people should be aware by this point that there are always two sides to a story and that waiting for more details is always preferable to shittin on someone without much context
aware
does x have any grounds for a lawsuit against adept if he wins his courtcase he can t full defend himself because he has a gag order on him so his image is taking a hit
deleted
someone check the other thread comments
i don t have any idea how the e sport scene works but 5k per person to sit and play games lol that s just fucking wild to me
honestly this is the worst time to get into valorant as a team owner or overall the cs comeback is going to send ripples into the valorant bubble
saved
what are the hasan frogs gonna say now they still hating
wow so lsf was wrong and he wasn t some evil guy
let me guess that adept had actually shameless want control money for not spending signed pro player after what happen xqc want build super valorant team its just really suck how adept litteraly want stole money to xqc after realized shes almost gonna lose court case since she kinda became way gold digging even thought xqc had actually idea want build valo super team since toast charlie with ludwig had done successfully a lot but when its came cost to build esport team its gonna cost lot more expensive such as pay the whole pro player operation and other stuff like between 30k to 40k bucks i just hope adept gonna lose court tho since shes post boobies ig stories

whats the conclusion of all this xqc needs to fire his manager and get someone who actually knows how to work with someone who stays home all day to play video games
the dude flakes on everything yet still feels embarrassed enough to not tell them that he s flaking xqc really never changed communication is key to maintaining relationships no wonder x gets in pissing matches with everybody so often
seems reasonable a bunch of kids who have never dealt with any sort of professional business dealing xqc is going to be seen by a lot of prospective business partnerships as a liability now i wouldn t be shocked if this hobbles him in the future my business doesn t deal with clients that have bad reputations but we sure as shit sell to the middlemen that do
classic lsf campers being wrong and insulting xqc for misinformation now apologise
the problem is not that he didnt pick the team the problem is that he ghosted them without saying anything if you dont want the team then just tell them dont leave things open and make people wonder wtf is going on
still no scuse to ghost the dudes say it man hes not a year old who make a upsie and dont way to told anyone
maybe my managers who are these guys btw
this guy loves to get himself into controversial shit for clips fucking boring
somehow he said absolutely nothing with so many words
i felt so bad omegalul
xqc and ghosting people is nothing new he expects people to beg for his attention even then he won t give in until the last minute
i felt so bad so i was going to pay them off said every rich person ever
he s just a shitty person it shows you deal and handle your problems not just ignore them that s what it means to be an adult
because he is a man child who has shown over and over and over again flaked on commitments and obligations
child behaviour
xqc is just like me for real
summary for you guys it s sammy s fault for being a greedy piggy
ghostqc
this video literally explains nothing lmao
another concise moment by this fucking tool
this mf always ghosts everyone its nothing new he rarely follows through on his word flakey and rude asf
i don t get how anyone can side with the players here isn t this just t2 valorant for not even a promising team
i ll save you the watch he s a privileged man child who needs people to do the most basic shit for him
the amounts were really big the amounts are up to par with other orgs
damn someone its eating all his money or what
what a cringe part of reddit nothing to be mad at here
that s pretty reasonable
i think the t1 pros were down but tt didn t want to shake up their core after stage and looking at mad lions rn i think that s pretty reasonable
interesting that in the original clip none of them mentioned he paid them
for your second point i thought he said he suggested this to the team but the team wanted to stay as and thats why x changed his mind because he wanted to make a super team
i like how gov left the part out that x paid them all for the time he wasted
backing out of a business deal is completely normal in the end
thank you
how does it always lead back to adept lol
he still should have been more transparent with the players themselves but the circumstances make sense its reasonable i mean if i had to tell the people that i was interviewing to hire that i can t because my wife is divorcing me and filing civil suit against me for half my things i would probably be pretty embarrassed too
jesus imagine getting 25k for not doing jack shit and governor still had the audacity to talk shit about xqc disgusting
that seems reasonable i don t see how this is drama i would have done the same thing in his situation
aware
but like for a dude that big wouldn t it be very simple to pay them with a company that you co create with someone else as a co owner or some shit so he can just have employes that are getting paid by a sponsor he could just leave out his name of the team for the time the court case isn t solved and become in charge publicly after that
damn but the court case is that expensive
at least lil bro wasn t trying to make a cdl team that shit costs a cool 20m last i check just for activision to mail you the paperwork pepela thats nonwithstanding the player salaries and the rest of the expenses of operating the team
people definitely forget how expensive it is to run a pro sport whether it s in esport or otherwise the problem with esports the other sports don t at the moment are global fans on a massive scale that draws in enough sponsorships and viewership that it makes the esports organizations profitable that s why esports orgs are having to rely on content creators now in order to make up for the money they re losing on their esports teams because really at the end of the day unless you re pro player is also a content creator if you aren t winning championships then you re likely losing money this is why you see people that are hedge fund managers bank ceos cfos etc often bank rolling the biggest teams they are literally the only ones that can afford it and once they realize that it s a losing investment if they re not personally interested they will drop it
consider me shocked they left out the 25k payment in their critiques
moral of the story never try to do any sort of business with this fuck
can t wait for the new mukitty vid about this
adabter
where is henry the investigator to update on the case its been a while now
damn i thought it was all memes and luls but for real didn t know she s grabbing him by the balls
not to mention investing in esports is just an overall loss look at tsm and clg both are cutting ties and clg is just done completely seems like a mistake to join the esports world at this point
if reason is true i would have dropped them like a sack of potatoes asap
if is true then it s perfectly reasonable to not sign them regardless of the hdmi situation if you want to sign us you need to sign all of us didn t get signed surprised pikachu face
that s not the issue though is it
there is also such little upside to the roster even if you think a team like dsg s upside is slim they are at least clearly trying to build something with some potential to grow steel can teach these young zoomers how to play like a pro which as we saw with g2 is invaluable in a league like ascension where many teams are relying on a talent diffs and short term scripted strats to win and for the record i really like a lot of the players individually but i don t see a vision in terms of how they can grow to compete not only for playoffs but to win some rounds and make a run i think tigg was a nice addition and idk much about mummay but i still don t see how they get better than tg g2 mm etc who all seem better and primed to grow in a similar fashion to turtle troop and i could totally be wrong but that is how i would view it right now as a potential investor
how would xqc know how to build a team for a game he never plays
but the team wouldnt budge can you explain this part you mean the players he already signed didn t want it to continue or that he was trying to poach a super star player and their teams were holding on to them
deleted
bro he can barely talk
deleted
nah the ones who were commenting on the first thread just went silent
he never signed any contract ofcourse you would be happy about that mr adepts _lawyer lul
tell that to the xqc witch hunt squad in this subreddit
that doesn t make it less scummy just because big corps fuck people over consistently all in all at least he paid them for the lost time which is a step above the norm
it s not a legal problem but it is unprofessional and that s the whole point with someone who s as big as xqc the client can only expect the person to act somewhat responsible
no thanks
take one for the team its on you

xqc ghosted ___ is just a adlib at this point fill it in with whoever or whatever you want and there is a good chance you would be correct
most responsible xqc moment
i thought a term sheet was just a summarization of like conditions for a potential contract like the very first step to that kind of business
lil bro thought it was just a dream until he realized it wasn t schizo
lil bro cant do anything right lol one day you gotta start acting like an adult
did anyone really expect xqc to follow through
almost like if someone did something for the 10th time you would assume something about someone
xqc couldn t buy the team for legal reasons and compensated the team because he felt bad about it
wow xqc being a totally self centered twat that never follows through on any plan no way
a zero context second clip rly got everyone riled up huh
classic xqc not reading texts and dms lul
i like how he forgot to mention that x paid them for the time they lost during negotiations
xqc couldn t made the deal because of ceratins courtorders
sorry but xqc owes them nothing during negotiations until everything is signed off and ready then dont expect anything maybe if they had actually qualified and didnt choke it would of gone through
what the fuck is this even about i come to the comments wondering if he was trying to play for a team or sign them but everyones just babyraging about xqc and ditching everything
maybe soda is not there thats why
pretty scummy from xqc but who s surprised it s a shame too cause this team had a lot of good momentum going won of last games beat ludwig s team top team last split and beat g2 who finished 2nd all for them to lose one game and then xqc just ghosts them
people in this thread don t seem to understand that a term sheet is non binding and merely an outline for what a future contract would entail plenty of people companies never follow through on term sheets it s why they re just term sheets it sucks for the guys who thought that it would lead to an actual future contract xqc is also a shitty businessman to not provide any follow up afterwards however that s just how business works sometimes it s infuriating for those left waiting around but it probably won t be the last time they sign a term sheet that goes absolutely no where
scumbag move after scumbag move at least hes not on kick
aware adaptor not allowing lil bro to spend millions
what was he obliged to do what kind of team is that is it a real team or just gamers who decided to call themselves a team if i m buying a company i m not going to talk to every employee
turns out professional gamers don t understand how business works if you don t agree on the terms laid out in a term sheet and the subsequent negotiations then you don t do business with each other there is no binding agreement at that point and you shouldn t expect it at that point either
oh no xqc is gonna see this post at the top of lsf hours incoming lulw
and yet again lsf proves they re a bunch of dickriders on the hate train gj
daily x hate thread el classico
so x was going to sign a valorant team and didn t y all do know a term sheet is a non binding agreement right maybe he does have someone smart working for him and telling him creating an esports org is a money losing endeavour
this hate boner in this thread is crazy it s becoming tiring now tbh
typical xqc move can t say i m surprised hope the team finds a replacement soon
nah he actually didn t payment processors can sometimes be a thing y all brainless if you think xcode is gonna ruine everything over 20k
500k ez
he s definitely not getting a reward anymore
a term sheet isn t a contract maybe he got a better offer elsewhere if you want the a list you gotta bring your a game
at some point even his clout viewership isn t gonna be enough to keep doing this kind of stuff right
literally have no idea why he never signed with them or if what this guy said is true and people are shitting on x already lol dude only wanted to buy the team for stream content i don t see why that would have changed
after the 100th otk no content no context clip lsf brigaders decide is time to make a xqc hate thread classic
when are people going to realize that he just isn t a good person
ahhh subroza the known csgo cheater absolutely shameless how this guy still has fans
i m mean shitty thing to do but turtle troops is probably the worst challengers team he could buy so i don t blame him
surely theres a way to blame fansly somewhere in here
poke forgot to warn him about xqc sadge
bro why are people so angry in the comments getting really personal with this shit it doesn t affect you in any way holy

no way xqc doing shady things
oh nice subroza the guy who blatantly used cheats to make a name for himself in csgo
you can always tell when the hasan frogs are mad all of lsf turns into a xqc hate gang bang people acting like he promised to pay for a child s chemo therapy and bailed

xqc is the type of guy to not show up to his own funeral
was whatever team he was gonna sign any good
juicer kids now googling how to troll the guy on the vid
i can t wait for the juicer to react to this schizo
i would be mad too if i lost a juicer backing that s a whole 1k viewers lost for personal channel they were hyping it up on twitter then didn t qualify lol now x won t be buying them after this stunt hopefully they do get bought by another streamer though
nah this is just xqc
they played like shit ofc they didnt get signed
they would have a higher chance of being signed if they didn t shit the bed on challengers
the amount of stuff you can get away with when you re lmao
not surprising at all
you d have to be an idiot to get in any kind of business venture with xqc dude can t even sleep or wake up when he wants to
can y all quit mixing my juicer with drama i just want him to beat the record already peepocry edit hurry guys downvote more do ittttttt
classic xqc
can t wait for him to go live and make a multitude of illogical excuses to convince his audience he had a good excuse for ghosting just like how he makes dishonest arguments to defend gambling
okay
human trash
i mean xqc is fun to watch but no one said he s an outstanding man you can tell he s never been to the gym or worked hard in his life he just plays video games all day and makes comedic judgements
yo
to be fair governor is not that good at a pro level
bros flakier than his scalp
trust me other streamers like luddiewig and hasan dont give two shits if hes a scumbag theyll keep collabing for the views
u mizkif wanna pick up a valorant team
he only shows up if it s about hasan
xqc doesn t even like valorant why did he even think about buying a team
is this even surprising this dude ghosts everyone lmfao including ltt
xqc should be live soon going to grab my popcorn as i wait for him to see this post
it is known for a fact xqc is an irresponsible asshole but nothing here suggests he break contracts or anything they were never on and xqc s side never announced anything sucks but don t get in bed with an irresponsible assholes
not my juicer
classic
anyways
i mean i do say this as someone who has it but having watched a decent amount of xqc over the years and seeing this sort of behaviour repeated endlessly over and over despite apparent intention it s hard not to get the impression that xqc might have some type of entirely untreated adhd has he ever confirmed if he actually has it or not not an excuse obviously but jesus this dude is almost and can t get a better grip on basic life responsibilities and tasks than a year old certainly can t debate focus or reason much better than one either and i say that as a fan
xqc is my juicer so i don t care perfectly explains why xqc will never emotionally develop when people are so afraid of spitting on the ring
imagine paying to gift karma lol
anyone dealing with this dude should add a no show clause in any document he has to sign
x is my owner aware
is there any situation where this fucking guy isn t just a massive idiot
still a mystery to me why xqc is so popular we can barely understand when hes speaking his personality is nothing special hes a known flaker he has no charisma etc i dont get it hes just popular for being popular
are we surprised
fool me once shame on you fool me for the 9876th time shame on me
who cares he s a piece of shit and i don t know why people are even watching him and it seems like every second post in this subreddit is about him
classic
what are you expecting from a guy yhat eats toenail omegalul
wow x ditching who would ve thought dude should get way more flak for all the times he s disrespected or just straight up wasted other peoples time
insane behaviour
b ro x ghosted soccer team after signing termsheets with them replace soccer with anything else and you would never hear this sentence being said it would never happen this a fake sport
xqc is the internet s biggest flake no contest
this guy is the king of bailing out of shit my god
hes fallin off
how does this cheater still have a platform lmao
are we even surprised if he shows ups at all anymore
mind if a child

damn is that a perfect13gend reference
sounds like early league of legends teams with tsm and cloud stuff same drama and all that it s a very ruthless career
huh
i don t make the rules i just think them up and write them down

thats crazy not gonna lie like come on man not cool at all
what being roommates with poki does to you
for that u get what u pay for xd
anyone remember when the dota division of navi literally ran itself and most of navi for that matter financially in the ground just to keep dendi on the squad i remember because the quality of his teammates became lower and lower as the years went on and the quality of the other navi squads started to suffer as dendi approached the end of his time with navi real
the players are his friends and they were only playing together for this one free to enter tournement and they got knocked out so making a joke of firing them
unfortunately toast has made a difficult decision that has resulted in the termination of all the players on his team the decision to release his team was not an easy one the manager has worked with these players for many months and he understands the amount of dedication hard work and effort that they have put into their craft however as the owner and manager of the team he understands the importance of constantly striving for excellence and achieving the best possible results despite the hard work of his team the manager has come to the realization that they are not meeting their goals and aspirations their performance has been lacking and it is clear that changes need to be made in order to improve their results as such he has decided to make the difficult decision of releasing all of the players on the team this is not a decision that the manager has made lightly he has taken into consideration the hard work that each of these individuals has put into their craft and he is grateful for the time that they have spent working together however he believes that this is the best decision for the future of the team it is important to note that this is not a personal decision and the manager has nothing but respect for each of the players on his team he knows that they will go on to achieve great things in their respective careers and he wishes them all the best moving forward the manager will be working tirelessly to rebuild and restructure the team in order to achieve their goals and aspirations this will be a challenging process but he is committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure that the team is successful this comment is real no fake
he was trolling
this was basically a streamer team and only one of the tupperware was actually good enough to be a pro i don t think they ever seriously expected to qualify for anything
tldr man make joke
pov g2 carlos firing half of g2 league team during before split finals because
because it is a joke
rent fucking free
well the tournament is over so there s not much to see
it s a joke lol
ummm you ok bro
does anyone here feels like this dude is projecting
he knows hes smarter
i can t stand this tiny dick loser link his of now
it s a joke with his friends
so you re saying would get you a win rate team
tsm with bjergsen comes to mind
especially since sydeon and quarterjade could break toast s legs if he tried to fire them
ok context was huge i thought he was being a dick i was like damn i thought dt was cool glad to read this comment
man your comment should really be a lot easier to find i ve been really confused for about minutes now trying to find context online as to why he s like laughing while firing these unknowns like that was probably their big break lol thanks for posting what op should have posted
classic chatgpt lule
it s amazing how easy it is to spot chatgpt in the wild after just spending a little bit of time with it
for a team that only practiced for days of scrim they were spectacular literally one of the best teams realized they have better aim than them and purposely went to a bomb site where execution and set plays are more important they are also streaming everything so m they are at a huge disadvantage
that s not necessarily true yes ttuperware is the only one that s played on a professional salaried team before but the others especially quarterjade and kyedae could play in the gc scene and do extremely well if they actually wanted to could commit the time to it
i mean everyone but syd is immo they could def grind for pro if they wanted to
he even said as much before getting her to join that they won t win and it s just for clout
ah no other tournaments to play or just scrims even
no you re not alone in that thought
no matter what kind of joke it was ill never forget i m just destined to be better gotta be the most hilarious disguised toast interview ever
sounds fair
i just use dendi as an example because navi dendi was the most strange case of a company nearly destroying itself just to keep its merch baby even though his merch wasn t making navi nearly as much as his contracts were worth
hi it s me toast
both have the permission to break every bone in my body
don t forget tenzin can also just walk to otv house and break his legs if kyedae is not fighting cancer and in pain she can also go there and break his legs or ask rae to break his legs tupperware is at a disadvantage here ripbozo
to add further context he wrote these tweets while streaming what he did was go to the twitter page of another e sports team madlions that just let go of a whole bunch of players which has been the subject of massive drama in the valorant scene and copied their tweet changing out the names
i was thinking the exact same thing with context this is super funny
dude come on lol they did well but you re making them sound so much better than they were the team you re talking about has all their players in radiants ranks while dsg was made of ascendant and low immo players you can praise them but like what better aim they also got 0d the next map with the entire team getting kills in total while keenc on the opposite team alone got kills
well they did play in the gc and frankly kyedae did not play well
extremely well is an overstatement tier gc is exclusively radiant players with the best teams having players who are like high radiant kyedae and jade are immortal there s a major gap between that and low radiant and then another between that and high radiant i think anyone could hit immortal given enough time and effort but i don t think the same for radiant
the team was formed just for this tournament they were never really planning on keeping it going after that s why this firing is a joke the next tournament they could play in is in months though but we don t know if they want to take away time from their streaming to play in another tournament and so they won t scrim either since they don t even know if they will play again
no i m toast
least insane powerscaler
wow people really don t like this for some reason it is a joke people
i think we can cut her some slack with the whole cancer thing
kyedae did great on some of the sets each player on the team carried on different days they played three sets total
i get toast s tweets aren t really serious i m just saying bummer woulda liked to see more of the team
ok but i m toast s legs
she said she wasn t feeling her aim and so she wasn t like trying if thag make sense like she defs plays different on her on days
sure just giving the full rundown in case anyone else sees this lol it is a bummer for sure i would love to see them play again too
my balls are toast s legs
i m just saying she was looking pretty good day one i don t think a lot of people realize they played two days i don t watch her normally though maybe she thought her shots weren t good even on the first day
my balls are toast s legs it s true i ve seen them

tyler can borby absolutely cannot
lirik would say no
pull up the shower clip
they would be darker if they left their houses
they literally half yes they can say it
expected someone chastising jidion telling him he wasn t back enough to say it me too lol
which is not a lot but its still weird that it was said times on the same stream
nahhh this entire session is too funny someone gotta see this and the entire stream
nah youtube doesn t give a fuck about n word usage
thank you for letting us know
i m about to say it right now
thank you for explaining what we all know
what a weird gatekeep it s not something that s just a hood thing
do you have low hearing comprehension he literally said nigerian jamaican
do you think all south africans are white
what in god s name on about
logic is biracial in the sense that erobbs daughter is biracial
nobody cares about percentages dude still looks like this https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/12/09/950562eb-5545-4fc8-8627-175fe7593c0c/logic-rapper-2-promo.jpg)

yea

how many hard rs would you consider a lot
the fuck not a lot how much do you use the word i ve not said that times in my life and i m almost dude the fuck
pokimane is literally an african american and people bashed her for saying the n word seems like people are fine with gate keeping who they think is black enough
sure it is obama cant hand out n word passes
are you black you from the hood for me it s a yes to both although i don t live in the hood now and ain t no carlton banks cat giving passes that s how you get white boys dropped
i ll give it a shot hopefully i don t mess it up what s up my nobles

linus hard r
its a dr doofensmitz meme
like per day or
bro thinks all africans are black icant
this sounds really dumb even though its true but most people from morocco would never be considered viewed to be african american they are much more mediterranean middle eastern
have you ever heard of this thing called the saharan desert that separates north africans from sub saharan africans https://www.science.org/cms/10.1126/science.aaq1322/asset/a24a8a86-97d1-4c3a-9a2b-74d5c1b0025f/assets/graphic/358_867_f1.jpeg
you are using the term incorrectly african american means a descendant of african slaves they cannot know their roots because of their ancestors were deprived of their history pokimane isn t an african american she s a moroccan or a moroccan canadian
hey its the village idiot back from the sheep fields
she s african but she s not black
elon enters the chat
honestly no matter where youre from if you are givving out passes youre probably a chump
damn bro you talk like a year old caricature
in a minute
oh look he s an edge lord
haha wait till he discovers south africa
yeah gatekeeping who is african enough or black enough is absolutely disgusting and the people who do that are actually subhuman
elon about to start giving out a pass with that
conveniently ignoring that the n word was exclusively used towards slaves from the west african coast they didn t enslave mediterranean folk
subhuman don t use that word whatever your point is you as a person will never be taken seriously if you think you need to use those kinds of words while getting angry
clip mirror most fact based dexerto article https://arazu.io/t3_12d9tsn/)** this is an automated comment
dexerto steals reddit content and never backs up their sources or gives credit
dexerto is trash a few weeks back they uploaded a story about a kid in india who killed himself over his mobile phone being taken away by his parents without explanation you added some random game to the article header image made the story low effort clickbait got a ton of shit for it and deleted the story and i love when their sources are attributed to a lot of people which then links to a twitter post with likes or some shit i say this as someone who loves internet trash but that site sucks
also a fianc which is spelled with an accent refers to a man a woman engaged to be married would be a fiance
see now they can can run with the title former fiance lul
still waiting for the dextero article about otk snuffy
that s annoying af for them tbh
guys they can t stream next week end because they have go to the dmv on sunday and they are sick and they have to clean
well now she s been blocked on twitter by thorin and richard lewis for sure

that isn t true lol people make mistakes but we credit people more than anyone
i had to just mute them and that jake sucky it was just nonstop posting random out of context shit trying to get as much engagement as possible and most of the time it was the dumbest fucking tweets like adin ross calls train on stream and talks about ____
til
you are correct it s a french word that s why it has accents
deleted
they re literally engaged
i ve had dexerto steal my reddit image post and when i emailed asking to at least give me credit they never responded albeit this was a couple years ago if they ve changed this strategy let us know
lmao they really make you log on and defend the company or are you doing this on your own time
for some reason just say mental illness we all know thats the reason
they have a shit ton of vtuber articles recently one guy who did work for dexerto who mainly did vtuber related stuff and interviews left though
as their social media manager things like your describing usually were found outside of reddit we avoid reddit a lot but if this happened i am sorry i probably wasn t around then i highly reccomend dming us or dming me on twitter same name as here i can t fix an image you have of them in the past but for the last several years i have worked really hard to make us the best source in the streamer youtuber space and while imperfect we are far ahead of our contemporaries imo especially in regards to credit and sourcing writers make mistakes though we cover thousands of creators every week but something to keep in mind we have people lying in our dms all the time about owning stuff so much it is almost a second job
bayzed gigachad
yikes
look it s simple you guys don t have anyone working for you who actually watches twitch or youtube content that s the reason you just don t get the joking culture hence why you guys are making mistakes like fiance it was said that she was his fiance but it was a joke only a person who understands these things can catch these type of jokes i would understand if this just happened once in a while but it happens a lot at dexerto where it makes people like myself think what s even the point if they can t even get the correct info forth either you hire me or hire someone who actually watches twitch
lol as their social media manager you should know that arguing with your potential readers on social media probably isn t a good look say whatever you want it s perception that matters and you re failing at that
id also say we are human and make mistakes on twitter you can t schedule anything beyond one tweet so if we do a thread and want to tag anyone in anything twitter won t let us and sometimes we forget human error happens but anytime we do we fix it
job applications are open https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/dexerto-jobs-worldwide/?currentjobid=3547664058&f\_c=3647680](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/dexerto-jobs-worldwide/?currentjobid=3547664058&f_c=3647680) like i said when you cover thousands of creators mistakes get made we don t have a stan for every community sadly our competitors make more mistakes or just ignore whole swaths of the streaming and youtuber communities so il take minor mistakes good luck applying
bro your site is consistently bad just hire professional fact checkers fact and point even after this comment thread had been up for a bit the website still saying fiance https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/fans-convinced-willneff-is-joining-otk-after-comments-from-fiance-2104654/ https://i.imgur.com/pczifi8.png
you don t make mistakes you the company not you personally are lazy and not doing the foot work relying on other articles clips for your facts and terminology they have other words for this like significant other which is a broad stroke and doesn t really make any assumptions get a thesaurus or some shit man
id also say we are human and make mistakes i mean you guys make a lot of mistakes like an embarrassing amount of mistakes
i printed this page and used it to wipe
then cut down on the load and make quality articles instead of click bait ones lul sure there s bound to be mistakes when you cover thousands but seeing what others most people are saying about the site including other streamer those mistakes seem very common even for simple topics
my guy your brand is literally a meme because of how bad the quality of journalism is it s not just some mistakes getting made
mate i spoke to the writer and their logic was sound the article was fixed to say exactly what you said unless i am mistaken they did get engaged
please tell me you used good paper because standard printer paper sounds awful
their logic was sound what was their logic i saw a comment say fiance also fianc is the dude fiance is the woman so your writer didn t even get that right
annnnd no longer reading dexerto unless i am mistaken they did get engaged no they did not it s a joke and there s one video where she says they got engaged and it s her explaining that he dick twerked the ring at her it s a fucking joke
32lb copy paper mama didn t raise no bitch
mate i tweet no need to be toxic we don t need people like that anyways i literally prefaced it with potentially being wrong enjoy your internet surfing
if theres no blood you didn t wipe enough

since when was ltg on twitch would ve thought he is perma d with all the wild shit he has said and how sensitive twitch is
did he ever get the taste of dick outta his mouth
what did he say couldn t catch that because he spoke too quickly
man this driver goofy
that is not ltg that is dale
one of my favorite things about ltg is that he ll make up a long winded story just to say he fucked your mom he has such a way with words i m disappointed by this clip

well said
hope he blows up on twitch
w streamer
get this fuckin loser outta here
damn
kirby
omg that might be the most insightful thing ive heard about this chase
your life is worth something
definitely doesn t show his growth he s just playing it safe now that he doesn t have another platform
he ate a very long twitch ban in season one of sf5 did a first to fifty set against a chun player and ended up losing the set was so mad by the end he tried to get the guy to meet him somewhere so they could fight it out
thought he was banned for selling vip mod
that shit will never wash off
he just said damn
you serve all purpose
he played erobb on tekken and only won by a sliver game and didn t rage at all then he played lacari got beaten every single game and zero shit talk i think he genuinely grew up
but he has youtube
losing times in a row is crazy i d be fighting demons after that why try to add another demon to the fight
i thought you were exaggerating when you said he went but nope there s a vod if anyone wants to look it up hours of ass whooping
never knew about this bit of ltg lore i always assumed his twitch permaban was for the transphobic rant against ceroblast does anyone have the vod for the set sounds fucking hilarious but ltg has never been competitive at tourneys versus fgc pros max rose and punk ethered him online too funny because rose doesn t specialize in sfv
why is that a bannable offense
ltg has gained a lot of new viewers so i don t blame you guys for not knowing much outside of clips and his new streams but the guy was literally watching execution type videos on his youtube live streams right before he got banned from the platform and if you check his rumble videos it ll show more of the rage you re talking about it s all exaggerated for his videos though so it s not genuine rage like his live streams from i like ltg i think he represents the better more honest times of the internet but don t mistake growing up for conforming
have you actually watched his stream or just clips lol
it got banned earlier this year
that s not really surprising for fighting games if you re even a notch better than your opponent you shouldn t ever lose unless you throw on purpose or get distracted tournaments are double elimination and in japan they used to be single elimination so there s no room for error if you want to compete
part https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ykycteqski) part https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khas4sjgdu8)
because you cant sell twitch services
he showed execution videos to his youtube chat tf
maybe i am wrong i watched the erobb stream it was like hours
for what
i can get why they d be single elim in japan because it s easier to travel around and the cities are more dense but can you imagine flying from like florida to new york just to get bopped out in a single game made me realize why fighting game players would learn more than one game too that must suck not to mention the prize pool being ass so you have to really love the community to commit to traveling makes me appreciate being just a stream monster
at first i think he was temp banned for copyright or something innocent but then he immediately went to stream on his alt and caught a sitewide ban for it
clip mirror governor confirms xqc did not pay the valorant team https://arazu.io/t3_12d5hpw/)** this is an automated comment
why do all valorant players sound the same
title correction governor says he has not been paid compensation by xqc
if its been only a few days since the deal fell through so it might take a couple of days or weeks for everything to wrap up and the players get their money
what did he expect xqc can t spend adept s money like that
he probably forgot to pay them while he was ghosting them
why would you expect a sum of 25k to hit your bank account within days of a deal falling through be realistic
deleted
most patient valorant player
xqc was the one who brought up the idea of paying them 25k when he legally owes them nothing because he felt bad about wasting their time so i doubt xqc would lie about giving them 25k
i thought a united states governor was calling out x for garnishing wages at first lol
why they are being paid i don t get it did xqc have any kind of contract with them
valorant brought together the people we need to avoid
if this was the guy i was signing i d ghost him too
can someone explain the numbers to me on how a t2 player was supposedly going to make 300k a year toast pays his entire team 600k a year including the coach and everything else going into it and i know a lot of t1 r6 players make way less than that
could ve been handled privately these dudes low key talked of it privately and then went public for attention
another misleading title to get people on a hate bandwagon not only did the deal only just fall through but the clip only refers to his individual compensation why do people feel the need to misconstrue shit
i just won t believe this why would xqc publicly say he paid them if he actually didn t you can hate on the guy for raging uncontrollably or not showing up to events but i don t xqc would ever lie about something like this
cause yeah 10k just jumps into ur account without going through the bank
god i hate valorant players jesus christ
glad he dropped them governor is a pos and doesnt deserve any contracts
does anyone know how long ago this was if we re talking a few weeks or more there s no reason as to why they shouldn t have been paid unless xqc forgot or decided not to pay them
shouldn t adept have paid half
5k for what agreeing potential terms gtfoh mr cow should donate 5k to charity and tell this just below average in pro valorant player that s nvr qualified for a major tournament maybe work for your bag rather then trying to freeload off a misunderstanding

5k for half a month holy shit thats good money
surely he will pay them tho in a timely manner

dogshit title he says he hasn t been paid yet
5k for half a month that kinda crazy
hit your shots and you might get paid

maybe xqc deserves some heat maybe he doesn t i dunno what i do know is that by them publicizing this so soon after the deal fell through they won t see another potential buyer sponser not for a long time sometimes throwing people under the bus is necessary but it always comes with consequences business dealings should always remain private until all forms of negotiation and recourse have been exhausted they didn t do that they went nuclear within hours
i like how it was only a couple of days ago the deal fell trough and now he spreads the word that he got ghosted and didn t get paid anything even tho he was owed jackshit x only agreed to pay them out of the good of his heart also it takes a couple of days for money to get transferred what was he expecting to get a fat donation mid stream
xqc bad

you re literally trolling dude always ending their sentences with a question mark
condescending but not trying to sound like they care
you ve heard of vocal fry now introducing vocal deep fry

valorant players sound like they re in a competition to use the least amount of energy per word it must be a natural adaptation in order to spend as much time grinding rank as possible and less time sleeping or eating ubereats
each game has its own voice all rp cops sound the same all valorant players sound the same all cod players sound the same a phenomenon for sure
sinatraa
i still laugh when i see an esports team and theyre standing all serious with their arms crossed like theyre some kind of bad asses when theyre computer nerds with no athletic ability expecting to be treated like we treat athletes
they got that youtuber accent
classic clickbait title
when i deposit checks for my family s farm it s an automatic hold for weeks before the money shows up
zoomer mentality is now or next
just cashapp me 25k bro
this is giving amber heard pledging donation vibes
lil bro can barely afford to keep the wi fi on at least adept is that nice
thought x said he did send it that s a reason to expect to get paid
nahh adept might lose that court since shes actually almost want start onlyfans because she almost start post that posture boobies on his ig and tiktok
he forgor

lmao
both sides have mentioned half a month s pay so it s 5k split between people not 25k there s no indication the ghosting started a few days ago given the news leaked of x buying the team on march 9th
i didn t get the impression from the clip that he s being impatient he might just be answering a question
25k a month jesus im bout to start playing valorant
because we live in the 21st century and there are things called wire transfers which take a day at most also the amount being transferred a few thousand per person could easily be done through venmo
ah yeah people expecting to be paid for their work are so unrealistic touch some grass my dude
does it really take longer than a day to send money in the us through my main bank i have a daily limit of 124k i can send to anyone instantly my other banks have a daily limit of 31k i can send instantly each day all of it free with no fees
bro didn t even complain in the clip he just stated that he didn t get the money he was promised yet and he made it clear that it s not 25k like people have been throwing around
yeah but it s also xqc it s very likley that he just says he will pay them and even means it but can t be bothered to do the follow up to make it actually happen
because xqc feels bad about it he said himself that he would pay them month for wasting their time and leading them on
no but xqc said he did pay them half a month salary
while being led on they probably didnt look elsewhere either as a team or individually
legally it doesn t take that much to be a valid contract so it really depends on what they all signed
the salary is not for one player but for all of them combined
toast pays his players 5k a month so 300k a year for team coach operating start up costs bring the total bill to 500k to be more precise tho toast told subroza that 5k monthly was the minimum salary wouldnt be surprised if steel s salary was negotiated up
toast and ludwig so by association charlie have gone into deep ish discussions of the cost breakdowns it is well worth watching the vods they uploaded to youtube on the subject
25k for the whole team i d assume
handled privately with who the guy who s ghosting you
lsf on their twitter arc
people need to realize this is not as simple as just paypal the guys 5k each he probably talked to his manager who is in contact with the players and they are in the process
is it really a lie if he believes he will pay them and just forgets to do it
the deal fell thru like weeks ago brotha
it s 5k split between people not sure if you need help with that calculation but it s not 10k per person
why is he a pos i m in to the valorant scene but i haven t heard much negative stories about him
pretty dumb to call someone a pos based on this one situation where you don t even understand what s going on
i haven t heard of him before the two recent lsf clips from today but he sure is about to learn a swift lesson about biting the hand that feeds you lulw
it was clipped from today s stream about hour ago
for all of them combined
my understanding is that it s 5k total for the team
5k split between players so 5k for two weeks 5k a month 60k a year that s a solid income but nothing insane
i think he s just a bit of a mouth breather or his nose is clogged up
geckpog hop on valo lil brooo
even though these people were insulting each other it wasn t even that mean it sounded like they were having a bit of fun almost coming from a dota player obviously
stop peeking bro you re actually horr ibleee like we looost bruh like not even trolling like you re actually brain dead

you nailed it

yeah ik im also a fair bit older now and can only sit still for so long before my back starts screaming for help

clip mirror destiny realizes twitch actually promotes fansly https://arazu.io/t3_12ctzck/)** this is an automated comment
not sure about how twitch development platform works but usually the requirements aren t strict and anyone can make a oauth login in any website
yeah twitch takes a hard stance against gambling too https://i.gyazo.com/772caf9f193ab234f3d504d6dc592f4b.jpg thats out of several different casino sites it literally just played as i was watching the destiny clip
this would all be so much easier if we did it like back in the early 2000s when most parents actually felt responsible for what their children had access to then in the 2010s everyone started handing out smartphones to kids as if they re candy and expected corporations like facebook to do the parenting for them ban children from the internet i want the old web back where people use goatse avatars and call each other gamer words
i mean of course they do just chatting is basically softcore porn anyway why would they care
the reason a female steamer can t directly link their own fansly account is because twitch don t want direct links to porn on their site probably to satisfy advertisers you can link the fansly site itself because it isn t a direct link to porn the female streamers all just use link trees anyway or verbally shout out theirs fansly for example destiny s wife openly promotes her nsfw fansly on her twitch stream and has been doing so for a long time
apparently you can log into fansly with your twitch account regardless of the indicated age on your twitch account
having oauth login is not promoting fansly
why are people talking about this kind of stuff now twitch has been open for softcore porn for a while now
does no one understand how oauth2 works
not really sure what destiny s point is considering you can sign into dgg using your twitch account and destiny is banned from twitch just having the option to use twitch s oauth is not twitch endorsing a website its functionality included by the developer of the site that you are logging in to not twitch does google facebook endorse every website that allows you to sign in with their accounts
that moment you realize poki and otv did a gatcha sponsorship
you can log in with just about anything these days scroll down https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/social-connections-oauth#configuration)
i feel like this is last week s drama can we move on now
qtcinderalla making a profit while crying on stream about deep fakes but also has no issue taking that quick buck advertising porn to kids
please ban me from this sub if another clip has someone saying an argument is disingenuous
ban gambling guys amirite
this is going down a dark path i m afraid
deleted
who
what game he is playing
i think its a bit stupid that you can t post a link on your profile but then you can advertise and promote fansly on your stream it s the same imo
deleted
the darkest timeline imagine train wasn t a schizo all this time and there are double standards holy shit
destiny is a moron
these people just qt hate circlejerk no one gave a shit then no one gives a shit now
removed
poggers community are now back pedaling and pointing fingers now and simply not even replying to the situation good lord i didn t know twitch was about having kids signing up to fansly a mostly nude saturated platform of women disgusting
anothua myth busted
it s not that complicated remove sexual content yes hot tub streamers as well from twitch there are porn sites for a reason let twitch be about gaming chatting irl streams etc
are people okay with stuff like gambling or smoking being promoted by twitch as well i m not sure what principles you guys have or are you just defending your fave twitch streamers
they should ban liquor outside of liquor stores if children see that theyll become alcoholics or just ban liquor in general porn as well
ok prediction time soon every boobie streamer makes a streamer awards every day nobody has to show up doesnt matter who wins but ads for their fansly onlyfans every mins once it gets too much we get a new section only for awards
mukitty clears
e thots always navigating the edge of tos until they cross it and nothing happens
deleted
funny how everything innocent end up in prostitution and degeneracy this was supposed to be a nerd safe zone btw
can we stop with all this qt hate she admitted she should ve saw the ad before hand but she didn t so she said sorry it won t happen again so can you move on already
fansly is great just another family friendly company
the oauth token is already blocked via fansly relax warriors
yeah i can literally make a site about butt scratchers and get people to login via twitch google and twitter it doesn t mean that any of the auth providers endorse butt scratchers
but i think twitch can take these down if they don t like it for example ludwigs browser extension innitially allowed you to log in with your twitch account and transfer your data like e g subscription following streak over twitch wasn t a fan of that and he had to remove it from the extension
true i mean you can log into destiny s own website with twitch and they have him perma banned lmao
was gona comment this as well literally any dev could just plugin any oauth provider and throw twitch in there as a provider im pretty sure theres alot of sketchy sites with google oauth added for most of them
true i m sick of hearing about how hard it is to join of or fansly yet they pretend gamba is easily accessible to kids when it s literally the opposite way around
yeah i don t want this broken over stupid fansly drama especially when a very useful app on tv lets me see twitch on there without the ads
every cs gambling website uses steam to auth but it doesn t mean valve endorse gambling though they don t really do anything about it
yup can confirm used it twice on two different projects
they do have some policies in place for developers but those are not checked before you can create a dev app i hope this news does not mean that suddendly every app needs to be approved first because twitch usually took months on approvals
the general conversation people have is about twitch banning gambling the reality is twitch banned some gambling they allow sites that do gambling but are licensed to operate in the us and other places unregulated possibly rigged gambling sites like stake however not so much people still stream some sites that don t have licensing but that is just because twitch isn t doing a very good job policing it the streams probably get banned if reported
twitch never said they were taking a stance against gambling
i dont think they care about gambling you can still gamble and play slots on there just not with unlicensed offshore casinos from their statement licensed by us or other jurisdictions that provide sufficient consumer protection
what are those funny letters and symbols supposed to be
what is this copium it has always been trivial for a kid to access the worst of the internet
i haven t accidentally clicked on goatse in over years and i m happy to not go back to that time
on top of many parents not giving a shit there s actually a lot who just have no fucking clue
ban children from the internet i want the old web back where people use goatse avatars and call each other gamer words who do you think did all that edgelord shit it was children
a large part of me misses playing team fortress and counter strike with the pure chaos that was sprays voice chat
tbf it was much easier in the early 2000s to control what your children could get access to i don t disagree with you on this point though children should just not be able to use the internet at all
i feel the old wild west calling to me
no comment has ever convinced me more that the average age on this sub must be
if we did it like back in the early 2000s when most parents actually felt responsible for what their children had access to haha hahahaha aahahaahahahahahahahahah how old are you
takes a special type of someone to want goatse back
the adults used it to go politically fucking crazy shit i d rather the kids have free reign
stop worrying about other people s kids worry about your own i have inappropriate shit blocked on my child s devices i don t care about other kids
ban children from the internet i want the old web back where people use goatse avatars and call each other gamer words i d love to go back to this too but you are on massive copium if you think parents from years ago knew more about what their kids were doing than those today
in the early s parents had no idea what kids were looking at on the internet what the hell are you talking about i saw videos of people getting beheaded and shit as a teenager not only was oversight nonexistent but the internet was smaller and extreme content was shared more regularly
is this a joke in the early 2000s we were browsing rotten com on our school computers
zoomer spotted finding hardcore gore porn etc was slightly harder back in the s than loading up say twitter dot com or twitch dot com i remember having to work to get around webfilters at school to show my friends crazy porn scenes on efukt vs going to youtube and searching naked yoga like now
you can link the fansly site itself because it isn t a direct link to porn wait how isn t it
the reason a female steamer can t directly link their own fansly account is because twitch don t want direct links to porn on their site probably to satisfy advertisers you can link the fansly site itself because it isn t a direct link to porn i m pretty sure you can t even mention your fansly or onlyfans account in your bio which would be exactly what you said in the second part they wouldn t then link you directly to anything
for example destiny s wife openly promotes her nsfw fansly on her twitch stream and has been doing so for a long time holy shit good burn
your age isn t exposed in twitch s api so fansly has no way of blocking logins from twitch users under however there is a disclaimer above the sign in with twitch button that you must be
when you re authorizing the oauth connection does it say that twitch will hand over your birthdate
how much does it really matter though i see more ass on twitter than anywhere else on the internet rn
yeah ive used smaller sites that have twitch account logins they are in no way going through twitch to ask permission if they can use the login for their site but this won t get the same reaction buzz and will be buried in the rest of these comments
it s about twitch s right and left hand contradicting each other right hand it s again tos to promote a fansly link and people get banned for it left hand twitch has fansly ads running and allows fansly to intergrat twitch api with it s site tl dr twitch accepts a site wide fansly ad campaign and intergration but has fansly promotion against tos for streamers
apparently not since https://i.imgur.com/fusx9sg.png google and twitter are also supporting fansly every email provider is also supporting fansly
is that even destiny s point op s title is pants on head r wrong but destiny says nothing of the sort he just expresses general disbelief maybe he s surprised that fansly had the guts to use it in the first place or surprised that twitch didn t blacklist fansly from using their oauth
is twitch running dgg ads though
they are probably just as bad as gambling sites examples are lacari and tectone lacari hated his life when he was addicted to them the dude was locked in his dark room with no emotion just playing those games kind of like train when he gambles tectone said he spent half of his year s salary on them and later if i m not mistaken hundreds of thousands look at lacari now that he stopped his life seems so much better
hate how all her friends are like well adin showed porn on stream so what bads make a right as if profiting by selling porn to kids isn t worse than showing booba or are they trying to say we re all pieces of shit get use to it
this is what pain looks like
and you re defending the state of israel on r youngpeopleyoutube
wonder when people will learn all these big twitch normies are just lying hypocrites
with deepfakes the issue is about consent that isn t the same issue
nothing wrong with tempting your under age audience with nudity adult content for profit you smell me
not until we get better drama
twitch needs to update their tos or at least come out and acknowledge how inconsistent their bs is or something
they are billions
funny thing onlyfans is technically the same onlyfans s ig account still never mentions any of their adult content creators and early on they even publicly announced they would be banning adult content from their platform before backtracking but twitch does seem to crack down on onlyfans links a bit more than fansly ones like people who have joke onlyfans with no adult content linked getting suspensions
everything you said holds true for onlyfans they re basically the same site
fansly is literally advertising itself as a porn website so i dunno what the point of your comment is
well it s advertised as an adult content platform on twitch so it s not really a gray area when you only see the ad just watch the ad from streamer awards and you ll see what i mean never seen patreon advertised as an adult content site i just think twitch should be consistent on if they allow adult content or not don t care either way just ban it or allow it
na fanhouse is like patreon fansly is like of
doesnt the ad everyone is freaking out about directly mention your favourite streamers are making adult content on fansly or something like that sure some people on fansly arent posting porn but the ad is directly advertising accounts that are posting porn which i think is where the issue is
it s basically patreon but with less rules when it comes to porn content
yeah no shit because qt and her crew are the folks who made a big deal about gamba and now they re advertising porn to kids like the fuck why wouldn t i be hate circlejerking them right now
the main issue is that fansly is an adult site with adult content even in the ad it says this as such it was advertised on a not marked stream that s a terrible decision regardless of who makes it especially since you can get to the adult content without any payment directly off the ad with just your twitch oauth sign in it would be like running an ad on cartoon network during the day for fansly instead it would make more sense if the ad content was instead run on adult swim where its marked for adults
how can people not differentiate showing something directly and saying that it exists elsewhere i truly truly don t understand it it s such a clear difference to me

question what makes you gay answer being attracted to the same gender as yourself that s it any sort of action beyond that doesn t define being gay all these people going on about sucking dick this and getting pegged that no that s got nothing to do with being gay
the title is just a red herring

he s literally black lmao
that s not the same person as in the other clip
u need some confidence level to draw the conclusion
any sample size below is meaningless
honestly if you don t constantly have a dick in your mouth i d really question your masculinity
yes best of seems pretty safe it s why it s used in esports though finals are often best of
so you re saying you need to suck dick and try pegging a dude to really know for sure

one correction is that s his teacher noise from when he used to substitute teacher https://youtu.be/dptte1scam0
out of all the noises in this video thats what you focused on
i know that poke used to play with ster a lot when overwatch came out and obviously jerma and ster played together too but idk if poke and jerma ever crossed paths
they were on the same team in the otk smite event more recently they played dark and darker together that is what i can recall
god the way he drinks the water afterward i ve never been so scared in my life
was there even anything else interesting to focus on in the whole clip
even worse that was a bud light that he drank

clip mirror forsen on the difference between streamers and youtubers https://arazu.io/t3_12cruv2/)** this is an automated comment
holy
takes to do one fluent sentence that s not that much it takes forsen an entire hour stream to do this
some youtube vids does almost look like stop motion because they cut like every words
he never misses
meanwhile northernlion
the hypocrisy coming from this clown lets not forget this guy spend minutes shilling for madmonq reading their script and promoting their gaming candles while playing valorant that brought his viewers to an endless coma
can someone enlighten me as to who this homeless gentleman is
one piece
true if i think about youtubers like ksi pewdiepie etc who have done live content at some point you can tell they are more akward in front of a live camera not having a full script multiple takes edited content and hours of material where they only choose the best parts its like forsen only uploading a video of him beating the mc record only with the god seed best parts of the run remade audio over the run and not the raw grind it took to get it
sebastian fors is literally the god freestyler he is lukas himothy the one and only
lion of uganda speaking wisdom
forsen s stream and jokes are scripted too his chat writes the entire script and then some silly tts voice narrates it while he sits in his asylum wasting away
a lot of shit on twitch is scripted or carefully curated too when the streaming boom happened it s been a constant battle of attention and one upping one another it s no different than the growth of reality tv it started out fairly loose but over time it s become scripted it s basically live theater so naturally it s harder to do than an edited video but still a lot of it is just performative
least based forsen take now we need to wait another hours until he speak again
talking as if youtubers don t carry like of all twitch content
pretty sure xqc needs takes to get one fluid sentence tho
this take would almost make sense coming from anyone in the world who isn t forsen
there is an eerie bone chilling silence each time forsen pauses between videos to deliver one of the most based takes the internet has ever seen
reminds me of the bridge incident
so one actually put a minimum of effort in their content and the other do the exact same thing million of people do everyday except they get paid anyway i m about to go freestyle a little i m gonna play a videogame
lol cuz streamers are so competent
he says it like it is
at least he had the balls to say it
youtube is like watching stand up twitch is like watching your friend eat shit after you tell him there is no way he can do a backflip both are entertaining
youtubers have to capture your attention in a short period of time twitch streamers have to do it overtime
except kripp he is too lazy to edit his videos so its usually one take
he s not wrong
this guy is pretty hot i d like his onlyfans
deleted
forsen
twitch streamers will be live for hours a day and maybe produce entertaining second clips if you watch more than minutes of a live twitch and are entertained the entire time you might be lobotomized
interesting take from the guy who is famous for how little he talks during stream
some youtubers literally can t speak even half a sentence without cuts
based
good one mr fors lule

atleast he has the balls to say it
i like how whenever he says something based he always takes a sip from the water
based
based as always
different takes and cuts every words
he s not wrong even in that little sec outro she had to get at least one more edit in
but he s watching others people content for content fuck was viper right forsen
forsen talking like he doesn t rehearse his your mom jokes every night in the shower
his desktop gives me anxiety
i think his mic is shit
whats gonna happen when his desktop fills up with icons
jesust
that clip awakened something in me
https://clips.twitch.tv/blatantgenerousradishcmonbruh](https://clips.twitch.tv/blatantgenerousradishcmonbruh) lule
based asylum take
other way around
one piece israel
i m pretty convinced no one on lsf actually watches forsen outside of reactions and clips since he actually talks a fair bit when playing games lule
months to get minutes right
most forsen fans have been watching him for years now he doesn t talk as much but we know what he s thinking even if he isn t speaking so we don t even need him to open his mouth copege kinda true tho
this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn8ri3ilvk8) has no problems speaking articulately what are you talking about
hour
and some youtubers do this thing where they edit out every moment of dead air to the point they re starting their next sentence in the audio before it cuts to the new scene of them talking in the video drives me nuts
that is thanks to philip defranco he popularized the quick cuts jumps as early as like
until its minecraft
nl probably says more words in a day than forsen does in a year
northern kinda ruined other streamers for me he s just so far ahead everyone else meanwhile every time i open another stream there s someone with a full head of hair disappointing
some people are fantastic at talking like music to the ear or boobies to my eyes
anyways um i bought a whole bunch of madmonq qandles do you know what madmonq is anybody know what madmonq is no not the mad monk i think he got shot to death i m talkin madmonq anyways it s a scented candle like meditation suplement that unlocks your 3rd eye and protects against unwanted thoughts that may be traveling in your mind that s my story i bought a whole bunch of stuff put em around the la casa little candles stuff like that
c
toosks classics lule
didn t some baj record himself eating the candle need some clarification
el classico toosks lule
brand deals are fairly common in the streaming space these days i don t know why you would hold something like that against him iirc his sponsored meditation stream was mostly improvised so it s not comparable to the tightly structured ad segments youtubers are doing these days
grigori rasputin
swedish aris
diogenes of sinope if alexandar the great forced him to stream to the agora
i don t think pewdiepie writes scripts or does many takes but maybe he could ve prevented the bridge incident that way
true but your favorite streamer wasnt a natural when they first started most ytbers that stream only do it as a side gig if ytbers committed to streaming some could be just as good streaming isnt a hard thing to do just takes time to learn the ropes just look at jerma cdawgva ryan higa all them started on yt and then moved streaming and are fine at it
it s almost as if making a youtube video vs live streaming are two totally different skill sets you only choose the best parts because that s how you make a good video no one would enjoy a movie where they used the first take for every shot
true however that usually results in a good video quality over quantity youtubers and streamers are just in different areas of entertainment nothing wrong w that
common pepper
one example of this is tts donos the streamer sees the donated message well before it is played and so of clips where the timing of a dono is perfect is actually the streamer just intentionally saying something beforehand to make the following tts funny and clippable
reminds me of an edited video of him https://clips.twitch.tv/bashfulslicksashimipipehype-bi49_f2nawlirqpb) which was too fluent to be the real xqc so i m thinking with a good editor xqc would do great on yt
depends what you re watching on youtube
this is like saying slam poetry is better than regular or freestyle rap is better than a rap song they re both fine it s just two different mediums
worst take streamers are just reality tv you watch hours for minutes of good content youtube is already curated and edited so you get that good minutes of content in minute video
for sure thats probably why when i was a kid and before twitch only watched yt i still watched lets plays from guys like pewdiepie and uberhaxornova because there was no cuts and just keeping it real
neither can the largest twitch streamer
hes gonna buy a new pc
he plays games
you must be new to the baj universe
i feel like forsen isn t real and he is just a figment of imagine i ve never seen him stream or a tweet or him collab with anyone
if you count slamming the table and shouting men va fan every few minutes as speaking
just like like this guy above here is talking about hour streams clueless
forsensmug smugtime
sssss pee semen
zoomer attention span editing aware
i always hated that some would cut out all the rubbish yet they d jump to them burping as loud as they can why do they have to leave that in like it makes them special
philip defranco along with his erratic body and arm movements while he speak it gives me anxiety watching his videos edit someone beat me to him already but yeah i can not watch his videos
i thought ray william johnson had a bigger part in it than pdf did i don t really mind it though it s what i grew up with
nl and squeex are always talking for their entire streams and it s kinda nuts
what are you implying here
clip mirror xqc insinuates that he ghosted the team because of the court case and that hes not allowed to spend so much money https://arazu.io/t3_12d385u/)** this is an automated comment
if you think about it it s not an easy situation because you are not legally allowed to pay the team you are not legally allowed to say the reason why you can t pay the team is he even allowed to pay the 5k the plaintiff made filed a complaint or violation for a tip court case is apparently in may unless it was postponed so hopefully it s resolved soon
absurd how much you can fuck with one person s life by abusing the court system it s been nearly half a year
that s actually fucked up
removed
he ghosted the team because he was embarrassed about the court situation and things got too much for him the final monetary amount would have caused conflict with court order he paid the team for the time wasted which they didn t mention btw which he didn t have to
this is why you set up an actual business with capital so that the business can make investments unless the court order extends to businesses you have full ownership from not sure about that
can anyone explain why he can t spend a lot of money while the court case is ongoing
but he s known that for half a year at this point why would he get these peoples hopes up a month ago
hey guys for legal reasons i can t comment on i can t go through with this now i apologize for the inconvenience and will do my best to find you something else took me minute to come up with this
you know what when this kind of drama centers around the same person week after week after week you start to wonder if he s the problem and not everyone he keeps blaming
why is everyone just assuming this is about the court case i think he just went to his financial people asking them to write a contract and they told him it would be smarter to just flush his money down the toilet now he s prob just insinuating the adept thing so the lsf incels take his side

i thought the case is done
wow so articulate
crazy a woman or anyone can sue you and fuck up your plans
he s probably made more than 5k since that divorce filing which would be his own money
am canadian so i don t know shit about the us legal system but wouldn t buying a team be a business expense i don t see why they would limit how much xqc can spend on stuff for work when it s likely a whole different entity in terms of personal vs corporate
why are the courts allowed to even do something like this to begin with yeah let s just tell someone to hold onto their money because of a greedy ex
it s so he can t lose it all gambling or hide it from the court for the record
i agree with you but the dramatic it s been nearly half a year is too funny
critical life lesson at full display at least everyone knows her full colors now
how he even paid them 25k when he did not have to a terms sheet is just an estimate its not legally binding
removed
the team hasn t been paid yet that s why it wasn t mentioned
it s to prevent one party from purposely tanking their finances so that if they lose the case the other party doesn t get anything
he didn t know how much the team would cost
i agree he should have done more research before even having a team sign a term sheet in the end it all sounds a bit impulsive and when it didn t pan out he ran away from it all adulting is very hard
if not xqc his manager or assistant could have conveyed this message on his behalf too which is why people call him a manchild cuz he has the resources but doesn t know how to utilise them effectively he never even had to talk to the other party directly
it was evident he was the problem on day when he went live
l take
far from it
unless it s a parking ticket in criminal court all court proceedings take fucking forever
does he know
its directly in the mind boggling terms hdmi managed to put in the case you can read them they are leaked he literally cant spend any excess money untill resolved there was even a mention about too expensive clothing are off the limit
judge isnt a juicer probably
because the court is impartial and doesn t see hdmi as a greedy ex
it seems pretty obvious if there is a dispute that you owe someone a large sum of money which you currently have it makes sense for that money to be protected until the dispute is resolved
i get why but it s nuts that you get into a relationship with the wrong person not have any kids not get married and you re financially beholden to them
people downvote you but i m divorced and even though it was completely amicable and zero lawyers involved it took around months kinda strange how easy it is to get married and how hard it is to get a divorce on the surface it feels backwards
for those of you that are too young it isn t women will try to take everything in the divorce it s secure your finances like a responsible adult
yes i m saying it s fucked up that he s in this situation because of court and other stuff
removed
oh they got paid they just want the too
toast did a whole video on how much it cost for his team 500k is a meme at this point for both lud and toast lol
yes adulting is hard thats why you are here with us other losers commenting on lsf about another persons life
imo u can be a manchild all u want about ur own stuff but when ur dealing with others u can t simple human decency that will make it so u don t end up alone
it s not a manchild he s a shitty businessman this whole thing with adept could have been avoided if he had any sense on how to conduct himself as a business entity instead of some immature baboon this is a massive lesson in being smart financially and utilizing business support systems like a fucking lawyer before opening your god damn mouth
i thought jabba had to pay her own legal bills which killed everything
weren t all of those motions denied by the courts or were some granted
personal skill issue e he did it to himself by having their finances tied together it s no where near as ridiculous as children and man children will lead you to believe
it s both
there are plenty of people who have enough respect for their partner to not do something like this ironically she s probably ending up worse than before since he let her live in the house for free
i mean sure but also partner selection is one of the most important things in making a happy life
juicers are very sensitive ok you have to spell everything out in macaroni art for them to understand
removed
money was said to be sent but the players have yet to receive it they ve learned not to speak on things before they re secured
toast doesn t dress slutty enough for xqc to watch his content
i m at work adulting and on here what s the difference lmao
next court date is may
no outlandish spending was granted no gambling was granted no jewelry was granted no talking about the case was already agreed paying lawyer fees to adapter was denied for now spousal support was denied asking x to transfer her money regularly while the case is ongoing because she can t afford to live
just because you shared bills for few years doesnt mean you should be able to basically freeze someones account lmao its especially ridiculous given how they both have separate careers you can t even argue its to keep her from being destitute
okay tater tot

when i was younger i never really realized why my dad always said whatever you do never marry as i ve grown older i ve come to know why he always said it he still says it to this day and i could not agree more
lightning black man white eyes
nah that would be too confusing for our brains have to explain in fortnite terms
xqcl
more like he talks to slow to retain his attention
slutty enough for me
being here in the first place no functioning adult would ever be here i am a manchild and oh boy so are you
spousal support was denied asking x to transfer her money regularly while the case is ongoing because she can t afford to live the biggest and most understated win of all those motions she would have a financial incentive to drag it out forever if she got that granted basically free alimony before she even establishes common law marriage x could basically run the clock if he s confident enough she can t sufficiently prove cl it d rack up huge fees for her the guy pulling these records isn t convinced the judge would make her pay his fees though she s really going to redefine what it means to be adebt soon
user checks out
adept totally isn t trying to take all she can
you can absolutely make sure to protect your assets and get married just understand your rights prior to marriage most women will agree with a prenup as long as they can protect their rights too
seeing my brother outside on a sunny day trying to conceal his crying while talking to his daughter on the phone during a divorce period with his now ex wife made me never wanna marry he said something along those lines to me at some point later on but he didn t really have to seeing him on that day made it very clear that it s just a bad idea
that doesn t make any sense edit ok now it makes sense
if i m a fully grown man child i hope to never grow old
surely even if the spousal support was granted she wouldn t be allowed to use that money to drag out the case
can you justify why he is not entitled to his post breakup disposable income
adept is all women least insecure reddit user
we have a understanding fellow lsf user
it s not separated like that they just shared bills cohabitated and did things that married people would do without being married
yeah let s not generalize to all women
and did things that married people would do without being married maybe their lack of commitment to marriage points to lack of commitment for deeper relationship meaning it shouldnt be treated as such alimonys function was to save the other party from destitution and provide recompense for career that was usually sacrificed to better care for homestead i dont care about technical minutiae but how any of this follows spirit of the law
i want all women to be generals i love them so much
how does it not dude should clearly not be allowed to use significant sums of money and your goofy ass reddit armchair analysis about how much money he s made or is making is completely pointless because you are essentially wanting the law rewritten so your juicer will be fine like actually what the fuck dude this is a once in a million situation
it s that the law has yet to decide the outcome and whether it s within the spirit or letter of the law until that decision is made they ve made the decision to place restrictions in order to preserve the efficacy of any potential ruling

that is with 15k viewers now it would be insaneee
he prob considers that pennies now lol
thats not good at all he can get at least 20k for hour easily 5k for hours is not worth it at all for him
those bounties were when he was he was a 10k andy pennies now
assuming it s somewhat close to linear that means he could pull 20k hour for sponsored streams but chooses not to and watches tik toks instead fml
yeah probably add a at the end is what he would get now
xqc said that he doesn t do them anymore because they are either not available to him or it would take all the bounty money for himself xqc has explained previously that what companies do is have a pool of money that they give to twitch towards advertisement what an individual is worth for advertisement often scales according to stats that twitch probably has in the background followers average viewers etc once a bounty comes out everyone that s eligible can sign up to do the offer bounty until the entire pool of money is used up but xqc has said that his value pay for bounties is so high that it would either take most of the pool of money available takes it from streamers who may need it more in a sense or it s worth more than what the entire pool is worth so basically he said he s not going to bother with them

now that s a bit
i m shocked that no one started comparing him to leisure suit larry yet he looks exactly like that character without the being creepy to women part
this totally isn t scripted
for people saying he was the first one to storm the capital on jan 6th why does that bother you so much he loves trump get over it already
is it a requirement if you are otk or adjacent that your go to content become planned bits its tedious
for the uninitiated into regular society like functioning socially twitch is not where you want to learn your social queues from there s hella cringe stuff there like saying cum in a way that appears funny when every normal person on the planet will be weirded out if they knew you were chanting that online to a stranger and strangers in chat chanting anything niche is social suicide but it s especially bad when chanting avant garde weird shit your social fiber defines who you are compatible with forming all that to master socializing anonymously on the internet isn t a good idea as it will only leave you unable to get friends irl you can keep the idea that you should be yourself while also admitting that even you yourself know that chanting cum is outrageous purging it from your thought process the self defense mechanism will be quick to find humor is exposition like this a successful troll there is no trolling that s how you actually instinctively are behaving and when put into a normal situation you re going to feel like a fish out of water sure you won t say cum in person but you ll end up not saying much at all perhaps watch some romantic comedies or something to develop a shred of emotional iq if you re going to copy someone don t let it be a person chanting cum let it be demonstrations of talking that tens of millions of people resonate with
an actual livestream fail
definitely staged but very clever
forsencd
kkonaw i saw him there in person
during his streams in austin he has done streams if you divide that by the strands of hair he has left you get jan 6th everything just keeps leading back to jan 6th
what is thr jan 6th thing that keeps getting brought up w squeex out of the loop
its weird that he always tried to hide that he was encouraging violence in person during jan 6th
he got fired through zoom nothing can hurt him anymore
the upside on being late is you can binge his youtube library
unironic degenerate parasocial warning i found squeex about months ago which is nothing since apparently he s been apparently streaming for years but i ve been watching all of his streams since back when i started watching he was only getting viewers and he d read literally any joke made in the chat and i d make a lot of them and he d laugh every time he laughs at every joke so that s not a high bar now he s averaging something like 7k viewers and i don t bother to type in the chat anymore so while i m super happy for him and i wouldn t want it any other way i m a bit saddened too because i m no longer one of the chatters making him laugh
yeah but think of all the tiktok videos you would have missed
i think he like he just look older
imagine loving that loser
crazy that you thought any of that was serious from either squeex or his viewers
to my knowledge most otk and friends streamers play games and react to videos as their go to content like most streamers ideally if someone s goal is to make people laugh then they would want to be making jokes of various kinds planned and unplanned if you think that is intrinsically tedious then comedians are not your thing
it s crazy that literally everyone involved in otk or adjacent to them has had the same content before and after otk yet people like you somehow think it s a new otk thing the only thing different with otk around is the big crossover event streams and gameshows but a regular day to day stream is the same from all of them also i like how squeex spent weeks in austin and you re already labeling him as otk adjacent by that logic even xqc and train are otk adjacent
yes and make sure you have the same or guys post your clips on lsf
cum
hope an ai wrote this and not an actual person
new pasta
forsen
bait
it s a bit bro
this guy still thinks that the yule lads are real
he gave me a high five
wow just wow amazing work if we figured out it out you know the authorities have though he always seems to squeex by
it s just part of the squeex chat rapport they claim he loves to say slurs is antivax and stormed the capitol the only goal is to embarrass him he loves it he s a sub
squeex is a closet eco terrorist anti vaxxer jan 6th insurrectionist hell bent on overthrowing the country by subverting his viewers and bending them to his will
he tried to overthrow the country with alex jones
genuinely wish his yt vids were mins i binged almost all his content in a couple days
he still reads chat he s not a 60k andy like xqc in which you d be lucky to get him to read your message even once

bald of you to assume

i think you have to go through quite a bit of mental gymnastics to come to that summary conclusion based on a dislike of planned bits on a platform of live streaming not everything has to be a game show with a laugh track my guy some most follow streamers for their genuine personality otherwise they d just watch bravo
sorry haven t seen squeex s planned bits before can you link me to one
hope an ai wrote this and not an actual person why are you not worth the intervention i see you as a person so i wouldn t be so sure of that perhaps think of yourself as being worth someone investing time into you simply out of kindness
new pasta please spread the word it ll do more good than harm either a person will delusionally rampage forward typing cum over and over into the void of a 10k viewer chat or they ll be like wow that is true i shouldn t be training these neural pathways to chant cum and only chant cum time to change

he has a squeex vods channel which i sometimes watch when doing homework
dude same
i do not think so if you dislike planned jokes because they are planned then most comedians are not for you if you dislike it when planned jokes are also streamed then i should ask why what difference does it make if a joke is streamed as long as it is funny not everything has to be a game show with a laugh track my guy not everything is so i am not sure what you are complaining about some most follow streamers for their genuine personality i do not think that is true for example i would say that most juicers know that xqc is different off stream and yet they like his on stream persona

look this is literally the definition of a straw man argument you ve managed to put comedy into buckets planned and unplanned and that having a bit of both is the key to variety in your comedy which is laughably absurd there s obviously so many things that contribute to variety and so outside of anything being discussed i am not interested in your misguided thoughts on what is or isn t comedy or how you became an authority on these classifications wild i have to type this to a possible adult if you think someone disliking fake bits on twitch as an augment to having a personality cool enjoy those streamers i simply commented that this appears related to being around the otk crew that causes people to do this i find it boring i m reasonably confident most people watching twitch would prefer genuine personality vs planned forced bits as the entire appeal to twitch existing is the unique ability to know the personality but also this sentiment exists on every fake joke prank video ever created on the internet
figured as much
look this is literally the definition of a straw man argument you ve managed to put comedy into buckets planned and unplanned and that having a bit of both is the key to variety in your comedy which is laughably absurd there s obviously so many things that contribute to variety and so outside of anything being discussed no i am going to give a summary of what i am saying so you do not make things up in the future your point is that you do not like planned jokes being livestreamed my reply is that if you do not like planned jokes then you do not like most comedians i assume that most comedians plan their jokes some of them also stream their jokes if you do not like planned jokes being streamed then i should ask you why that should make a difference i did not say anything about variety when talking about your argument i simply commented that this appears related to being around the otk crew that causes people to do this and i said that to my knowledge most otk and friends streamers do desktop streams and play video games most of the time so i do not think that is true i m reasonably confident most people watching twitch would prefer genuine personality i doubt it most people are there for gameplay and events on twitch are they not also i think a funny joke is a funny joke regardless of if it is planned
ideally if someone s goal is to make people laugh then they would want to be making jokes of various kinds planned and unplanned are you pretending this is not a reference to variety come on now anyways who cares if i have to explain the difference between enjoying a genuine personality vs watching standup or sketch comedy and being able to enjoy both i d be a fool to continue what appears to be either a disingenuous or at the least a very misguided or confused conversation sorry for inadvertently insulting your streamer based on what i like i m glad you enjoy that type of content i will however continue to not enjoy whatever i choose despite your protests have a nice day
are you pretending this is not a reference to variety you were saying that i am misrepresenting your argument so i talked about how i represented your argument i did not say anything about variety there my point about making people laugh is that if you have any goal you ideally should sometimes plan things and experiment with different approaches to your goal i think that this is a truism this is also true if you want to make people laugh to my knowledge most comedians plan their comedy if that is a problem for you then most comedy is not for you that is my point i did not say that variety is necessary for comedy
you ve turned my statement about finding bits tedious into a commentary on what i am allowed to find funny or unfunny i am concerned you are unable to recognize that as ridiculous not gonna re litigate the entire thing as again you are having a whole different argument unrelated to what i said squeex is not a comedian the joke is an extremely tired and lazy trope in substitute of just having a personality i am not sure why you as the de facto expert in comedy would stoop to defend it i find squeex funny in his normal interactions i don t find him doing the same type of lazy comedy commonly attributed to someone like mizkif who is trying to entertain children to be funny or enjoyable sorry
bro you don t get it the streamer you like just doesn t got the genuine personality like the streamer i watch does most people agree with me despite the downvotes and this planned bit being at the top of the reddit
you ve turned my statement about finding bits tedious into a commentary on what i am allowed to find funny or unfunny no i am saying that if you think these jokes are not funny merely because they are planned and if most comedians plan their comedy then comedian are not your thing the essential point is that planned jokes are not an otk thing they are usually a comedian thing most otk streamers stream games and talk to their chat squeex is not a comedian so you like planned jokes if they are made by people who call themselves comedians the joke is an extremely tired and lazy trope in substitute of just having a personality so your problem is with this joke not necessarily planned jokes being streamed
i think unless you are willing to accept that some people do not find bits that rely on the audience believing they ve actually gaffed as unfunny then we are just going to go in circles there s a pretty clear difference between enjoying comedy and this i wouldn t watch a sketch show expecting them to just be personalities you literally can t do a bit like this because of the context which is the entire point of why i find it tedious

clip mirror hasan on ludwig bringing up his european background https://arazu.io/t3_12c5fwl/)** this is an automated comment
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2jqdtkiocgq same energy
pretty sure ludwig is joking but you will genuinely run into americans who say shit like ah it must be the irish in me when their family immigrated to the us like fucking years ago lmao
well if his parents are born and grew up in europe it s fair to assume that some of their values and viewpoints like a more laid back view on nudity and sex have rubbed off on him so it s fair for him to use this argument
im pretty sure lud set that joke up for content and it is working way to on the nose
he may have been raised in america but his parents are were european he will have been raised with european values even if american values will also have had an influence
most american looking acting dude talking about his european background lel
everyone saying it was a joke is missing that the response is a joke as well one of those lsf in a nutshell threads you socially illerate dummies
what if i found both people in this clip funny what then reactionaries
nobody laughs at a hasan joke as hard as hasan does other than possibly hasan after he repeats his joke inevitably only one that can defeat him is himself
a rare hasan good one
americans love to talk about themselves like they re some kind of dog breed it s so weird
says hasan who said his ottoman genes are making him wanna conqure a girl that was from balkans
when he pronounces his name correctly maybe he can bring up european background
i love how hasan says this like he doesn t claim different identities depending on what he s arguing about
hasans laugh is getting up there to be one of my favorites lol
if hasasn isnt shitting on europeans is he really living
his mother is a first gem immigrant is it so hard to believe he was raised with french values and he groups all of eu together because they as a collective view nudity more casually for lack of a better word

damn all y all out here getting salty that his parents are first generation immigrants and would have passed on there devalued to him but the first brown kid you see that s even an non european you ll assume he s basically a full blown citizen back where his heritage lies
funniest hasan bit i ve ever seen
doesnt hasan bring up his turkic roots a lot
i mean i talk about my european ancestry all the time but im a first generation i think it s normal for some of us
maybe it s because every accent i ve heard this guy do is terrible but the french one wasn t nearly as bad as i thought it would be
like hasan hasn t ever brought up his own background lmao
god hasan is insufferable
super turkish muslim hasan btw
thank fuck one finally said this americans are crazy puritans and all their arguments always go back to think about the kids us an history in censoring nudity and sex scene in movie and tv in europe nobody care since a young age nudity is normalized and not satan s work kids grew up just fine
pretty much everyone in the us has a euro background it s a nation built by immigrants now it s just a circus
so every other race can grow up american and still have roots but if ur white all ur roots are cut
r shitamericanssay
european background lol
never seen someone so rqcist as hasan been allowed on lsf twitch double standard are huge
i don t get europeans you guys make fun of us for having no culture then ridicule us when we talk about our heritage i used to have such a positive view of europe and it s history since being on twitch it s completely changed our country is only years old we are not that far removed from our grandparents idk what s so crazy to understand
isn t hasan s whole thing being turkish even though he s from new jersey
if you have bloood and ancestry and look like the people from that country than you are one of them i am a slav so if some american has slavic ancestry then he is one of us much more than some arab dude born here
racist accent so funny imagine if he did a chinese one like dr disrespect
you guys are the biggest haters other than r entertainment and r celebrities
i would ve bet money the comments within this thread would ve been criticizing him for his my turkish roots when it s a similar situation as they re both american with values from other cultures instilled into them as well as american ones
wasnt hasan born in new jersey
the soys of twitch are having drama now
just another example of eu living rent free in na brains
deleted
yee yee ass not very aave of you hasan
i cringe so much when americans do this thank god hasan did call it out lol
wait is it no longer progressive to support sex workers now it s libertarian i mean i thought i was progressive but it feels like the goal posts keep shifting away
oh pls this guys uncle is crazy aka the young turks i can t take this guy seriously since he is just part of the shit wrong with this world hahaha sounds like a fucking nerd
does hasan know where libertarianism and liberalism originated
deleted
hasan a man born in new jersey that commonly talks about his turkish background dissing a man for talking about his european background americans lmao
deleted
hahahahahhaah yeah we dont claim him european
americans thinking theyre any other than american sad
ludwig says in his video he doesn t care about the kids but i m curious what the average age of his viewers are is it still not teens below the age of essentially minors
lol same energy as when hasan talks about being turkish dude moved as a little kid and spent most his time in america
she tryna gas it up
that man weas crocs bro
will s laugh lol
haha will is the best
hasan needs to stop bullying ludwig
god these people are so annoying
at least ludwig actually has a french mom so he isn t completely wrong in that it may be part of his upbringing not some magical gene
lud is first generation american dad was swedish and his mom is spanish french even his sister was born in france so he s literally the first american in his family he s one of the few exceptions who can speak of a european background legitimately
does this logic only apply to white americans cause i ve heard american born chinese kids say the same stuff and no one bats an eye their family has been in san francisco since the city s creation
i ve seen yank women and men talk about their nordic heritage and what certain runes and shit mean to them must be tough to not have a proper identity edit the yanks just woke up and are seething
this is every person in boston
pretty rare for someone from ireland to have immigrated years ago there are plenty of people that are second or third generation who have their living family members that immigrated and that had a major impact on their upbringing sorry that america is a melting pot and that you don t like it
yeah americans have no culture or roots it s quite sad
right imagine giving a shit about something that happened to your family years ago
because of course cultural traditions and them guiding your behaviour usually due to the insular nation of neighbourhoods obviously can be weeded out in hundred years it isn t like the jewish population has kept their identity after thousands of years of settling in various countries but no one says your family immigrated here years ago stop acting like your cultural heritage has any type of bearing this is clearly reverse racism it is wrong for europeans to draw on their traditions but it isn t wrong that ethnic minorities do the exact same things constantly with no one commenting but of course it is only wrong when the white cultures do it because we obviously don t have cultural differences
it is a us thing mostly i guess here you even have people who consider themselves another nationality after just a few years you have people say i am danish but i migrated from sweden ok that never happens but you get what i mean in the us it seems so weirdly twisted where people try to justify a lot of their actions with heritage which is kind of a result of disagreeing with domestic values i guess and seeking help elsewhere less a result of ignorance
so if my year old grandma come over from ireland at i m good also a ginger so pretty strong case for myself it must be the irish in me
do irish people get mad about that i would love if people that emigrated from my country centuries ago were proud they just aren t
if you have bloood and ancestry and look like the people from that country than you are one of them
it s still the most na thing ever to say european background as if the european countries are the same lol no one who s from france calls themselves european they call themselves french same goes for every eu country
have rubbed off hehe
i get where lud is coming from i have a chilean mom who immigrated to the states so a lot of her values from chile passed onto me even certain english words i mispronounce to this day even though i sound like any other american english speaker
it s still pretty funny when people who were obviously socialised in america defer to heritages they are fairly divorced from
honestly our view on nudity and sex isn t as much laid back as people think it s been getting more strict ever since eurotrash stopped airing the goat show
i think the point is that it s cringe to use your ancestry to justify some random personality quirk kinda like astrology
this is still an na take only na refer to people from european countries as european nobody calls themselves european over here each country has a vastly different culture so this whole thing is pretty naive
he also lived in france till he was like i believe
i m spanish and i reacted the same way as hasan did after watching lud s video lud is such a libertarian he is just using the european nudism stereotype to defend his idgaf attitude he is being going with lately wonder were that european values were when certain incident with one od his best friends happened
too
way to on the nose compared to up the nose which is what train does
but his parents are were european damn dude you didn t need to bring up his dead dad like that s
if both of his parents were born in asia it d be so where ya from
my european parents instilled in me the love of nudity and pornography ah yes
deleted
he also was raised in france till he was like 13ish or so if i remember correctly
deleted
american looking what do you think people from europe look like
his mother is french and his father is swedish he s the only one in his family born in the us
arent his parents actually from europe though
american looking is the most american thing i ve read lmaooo
uhhhhh so like white americans come from europe
i mean to his credit he does own a vespa that s like the most european thing ever

w advice tbh
well if it isn t the consequences of my actions
his friend is just using his corporate as a scapegoat cause he doesnt to hang with him anymore
i came here to be me damn and people are hating on you for being you it must suck to be in that position huh
clueless
i wonder why
we will probably see more people cutting him off completely as well but i mean if said person also supports the platform kick then i find it to be hypocritical since that platform literally allows adins and his friend s toxicity
who the fuck even watches this guy anymore let alone wants to associate or be friends with him
didn t he say he was quitting streaming or was that just an epic april fool s or something he really should for everyone s benefit his most of all he thinks these edgelords are his friends but he s just becoming a lolcow for them and obviously spiraling
how did he go from streaming in a house with some character and rizz to a dull white closet with horrible acoustics dude looks and sounds like he is a boomer with a tiktok live account
i can t believe i ve done this
fafo
your pretty naive to how much people want to watch drama and toxicity even if they hate it they watch it
why do i keep doing this to myself adin ross
you can be some what toxic without being extremely hateful and racist or inviting racism onto your streams like constantly inviting that neon kid on his streams
mitch jones moment
i don t watch his stuff i was just saying people love controversy it goes back to my mom buying the tabloid magazines when i was a kid at the checkout line people eat that stuff up why is famous his music is dogshit but his drama is impelling btw you saying what he does means you do watch his stream idk what a neon kid is you do tho because you be watching lol your proving my point
nah mitch hates drama and he even has said many times he never starts any

yayayayayaya never gonna stop now https://i.imgur.com/agk2lar.mp4
twitch is scared of kick rn so they have to unban indiefoxx to bring more coomers in
this is kinda the best thing for amourath the competition of topping each other gave them both massive views kinda like forsen vs xqc but not as hot
amouranth why do i hear boss music
squeexing my shit to this news
finally getting binarual farts back on twitch let s go
it was odd that she was singled out anyways
twitch so desperate for revenue they are busting myths left and right lmao

new ceo w this will bring back the arms race of twitch
she s back to dmca the subreddit to hell with her clips
dude wtf
yikes
that twitch unbans people at all after multiple warning bans is fucking weird it just encourages people to be awful to get clout
twitch should just sell out and make a category dedicated to nsfw
look you will always get unbanned if you flirt with the right people _ take it to form me
she s basically who started hot tub meta on twitch
normally i see a twitch ban and i think to myself who gives a shjt it s only for a few days anyway today i see a twitch unban and i think to myself who gives a shjt it s only for a few days anyway

clip mirror maciayla says she was flamed for her hottub takes on housewives and calls out the hypocrisy of promoting fansly https://arazu.io/t3_12c2c3v/)** this is an automated comment
wait thats macaiyla why does she look so different
drama frogs starving pepehands
all streamer drama comes down to well when i did said this you did said that mr or mrs hypocrite and they re all hypocrites calling each other hypocrites
for context for people that weren t there qt maya malena and adept were against the hottub streamers other sexualized content on twitch etc while macaiyla was completely fine with it and accused the other girls of hating on sex workers they got into a heated argument about it on the housewives podcast to where macaiyla was getting name called i believe by malena it caused macaiyla to not go on the podcast ever again edit qt was very out spoken against this stuff a few years ago which lead to this very heated topic on the housewive s podcast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-kwe5ekgxy&ab_channel=qtcinderellaclips
what i found funny at the time is how everyone seemed to pile on indiefoxx but supported amouranth even though they were doing the same content and both pushing boundaries maya for example had amo do an alveus stream while at the same time saying stuff about indiefoxx how she s turning twitch into a porn site
i don t remember what i said but i was literally right
erobb looking ass
damn she really does look like eerob wtf
my question is is who watching macaiyla streams
i m clutching my pearls to this gonna keep doing it even if you ban fansly ads
why is erobb wearing a wig
the reason the other girls got angry at her was because she was saying she doesn t care that when a hot tub streamer ended stream all the chatters flooded other girls streams harassing them it didn t affect macaiyla because she rarely streamed and was lower down in just chatting malena was against it being on twitch qt wanted them out of just chatting or twitch section https://youtu.be/837qqbj4u58?t=4349) maya seems to care less about the nudity and more that it builds a parasocial connection that can lead to stalkers adept was trying to moderate mostly
what am i not understanding the take was they didn t want them next to them they said give them their own category which they did they are completely fine with fansley and only fans but they just didn t want somebody half naked in the same category as them that was the main argument
bro who tf is that
just like then she doesn t understand the difference between supporting sex workers and not wanting that kind of work on twitch itself
lol housewives always rent free brings it up every time
i don t remember my take but i was literally not figuratively right about everything lol k i remember kind of agreeing with her when i watched that podcast and i don t remember exactly what she was saying but don t be obnoxious about it now
it s crazy how macaiyla is just completely rewriting history in regards to what happened on that podcast macaiyla was the one being insanely aggressive and started accusing malena of hating sex workers then malena called her dumb in response to her attacking her and being so aggressive it was a super civil discussion until macaiyla went berserk for no reason since that podcast macaiyla has brought the situation up so many times and did the same thing last year during the streamer awards
the fuck happened to lsf the last few weeks the amount of people mindlessly spouting off talking points from the streamer clique and defending them endlessly has gotten ridiculous
bro who the fuck is this the change is fking huge
the moral crusader arc of this subreddit from the gambling to now this is so fucking tiring none of you give a fuck about some kids you just want to shit on streamers you don t like this shit is whack
whomegalol
has she always sounded like an annoying year old boy
xqc train and maciayla all have something in common that i find annoying i don t know what it is though
this drama is boring next one please
she really needs to fix the lighting for that room cuz she looks like she has a o clock shadow
why would erobb say this
lsf andy s aren t going to like this one
fatshaming transphobe
honestly her jaw is coming in real nice looks rlly good fuck macaiyla as a person though
interesting now let s see her trans takes
why is erob there where is macaiyla
lmao the copium in the comments yes hot tub streams are bad because then viewers will constantly ask me to do one yet me promoting adult websites is not going to encourage viewers to ask me to make an only fans
the crimson chin
i thought qt take was pretty much that there is a proper platform for adult content which was platforms like onlyfans an ad for fansly is not really hypocritical since it is basically saying if you want adult content then you should go to that site which was what she was advocating for
the funny part of this whole thing is that last year during the first streamer awards maya was about to refuse to cohost the show because they needed the fansly sponsor to pay for it and i remember thinking at the time that she was being silly because who actually cares but i guess i m the end she was kind of right that it comes off a bit hypocritical to take the sponsor as people who were so vocally against the hot tub streamer thing
jesus she looks like a totally different person good for her
the crimson chi whoa who dat
bro why does she look exactly like erobb also im starting to think her chin was actually something special lmao
she s not wrong but also fuck macaca she s the worst
you know what crazy lsf reddit becaming bit shaming of tmz streamer version drama people had been arguing all the time what i seen this week which is the whole situation drama xqc said tos became inconstancy since after what happen car chase because blaming hasan but is not call out streamer to not cover overlay to showing gore blood vioalation sponsor drama because what i seen that people getting more conversation like how not allowed to get sponsor for future revenue such as porn ad like fansly and even crypto currency like coinbase and even lastly about how they callout gamba sponsorship stake after what happen trainwrecks do first and get widesprear to all other big streamer like xqc adin and even corinna who almost getting downfallen streaming career thats only fact how na streamer getting lot drama in lsf since big brand sponsor who doesnt want sponsoring to brand risk streamer compare spanish community who getting lot big sponsorship for having big event on twitch
mac was right though your fav streamers all mainstream steamers are clowns and hypocrites except tyler1 and the doc
she looks so much different than when i last saw anything about her wtf lol
too many hypocrite streamers shes right just shut up and play video games everyone trying to be clark kent but have too much hypocrisy within them
did the surgery fry her voice too or is it the swollen jaw effecting it
she actually looks so good with the chin holy shit surgery was a dub for sure
as soon as money is involved a lot of people will reconsider and adjust their opinion
the surgery has changed her face so much it s crazy in a good way ofc
i don t doubt it this sub reacts pretty psychotically towards female streamers
she looks so good tho wtf
trueeee
who cares
deleted
lemon
every sane person can see the hypocrisy of qt and of the people that didn t said anything about the fansly ad
the weirdest thing about this whole fansly saga is how fucking pearl clutching some streamers comments are please think of the children what would the children say as if we all did not watch porn at and fansly of is often way more softcore stuff
i remember seeing this podcast live and it was so uncomfortable how adept kept piling onto macaiyla several times it looked like everyone was ready to drop the argument and move on but adept had to keep taking these little jabs at the end that started the cycle all over again it led to macaiyla leaving the podcast and i understand why
w maciayla
i like how people in this thread saying to stop hating on qt and others calling names maciayla and everyone is ok with that
she looks like erobb so much it s crazy i can t unsee it
i don t think anyone is saying the fansly ad was worse or the same as adin doing what he did people are saying that ad was wild and a huge mistake on everyone s part and in general it is hypocritical to take fansly sponsorships considering what these people have said about that kind of content in the past x took a fansly sponsorhship for his own show he s guilty of this as well
she looks so weird bro like worse hopefully it looks better after full recovery
i will not lie she looked better with the face she had before just a unique look unique is often more beautiful than looking like average joe and now she has no distinctive facial features anymore
dam she hot now
who win the debate

that erobb
tyler came up ngl https://www.instagram.com/p/cn-eonosvhu/?hl=en
lsf chat twitter bullied her into massacre ing her face lmao
you didn t see her after surgery pics you would think that was erobb
transphobes love getting gender affirming facial surgery
i feel it needs to be stated every time this topic comes up that no one gave a shit when jerma sponsored them this controversy is stupid it s more like people are only mad about who sponsored them not the actual sponsor it s been a trend too shit on qt recently
if lsf is looking at tyler1 s girlfriend of all people for drama takes you know they ve run out of actual relevant streamers to clipchimp
all steamers are fucking dumbasses who shouldn t be giving takes on anything because half barely finished highschool nowaying
highschool drama clique queens aware
the streamers fanbase all of the sudden but think about them kids lmao
now that adept no longer has x her tiktok very much resembles those female streamers she used to look down on
why not just link the housewives episode general hot tub discussion starts at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837qqbj4u58&t=3500s) qts statement about her position is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837qqbj4u58&t=4324s) i had an upswing in like random people coming in my stream saying saying when s your hot tub streamer you should go put a swimsuit on or why are you there s been an upswing and i was like what the is going on where is this coming from and then i realized i click on just chatting and the person the next female is in a hot tub and i m like oh that s why and so i think twitch needs to have a separate category at least like maybe outdoors or something like that so she wasn t against hot tub streams in principal she just wanted to have them in a seperate category at that point that was also what she told her twitch rep and what got implemented https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0npiz51gqi4&t=3021s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0npiz51gqi4&t=3021s) probably wasn t just bc of her but it shows that she wasn t fighting for a hot tub ban
hasan has mentioned that he had a heated discussion argument with qt and maya about hot tub streamers like a year ago or some shit over dinner
for context for people that weren t there qt maya malena and adept were against the hottub streamers other sexualized content on twitch etc while macaiyla was completely fine with it and accused the other girls of hating on sex workers they got into a heated argument about it on the housewives podcast to where macaiyla was getting name called i believe by malena it caused macaiyla to not go on the podcast ever again yeah macaiyla was completely ignoring what the other girls were saying and falsely accused them of hating sex workers then malena got heated in response edit qt was very out spoken against this stuff a few years ago which lead to this very heated topic on the housewive s podcast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-kwe5ekgxy&ab_channel=qtcinderellaclips macaiyla attacking malena is what made things become heated qt became okay with the hottub stuff after they got their own category qt s main issue was always that they were in the same place and would get painted under the same brush but she was then satisfied with the separation between just chatting and hottub stuff
i can t really remember the situation but i remember macaiyla was legit just wrong being a child about it she got salty enough to the point of quitting the podcast to put it in perspective
i have no problem with hottub fansly gambling or nudity even legal issue it s easy access on the internet anyway but i guess that s a hot take these days the virtue signaling is getting annoying
why are people upvoting this rewriting of history people really just want to see the world burn off this stupid drama lmao
maya malena and adept were against the hottub streamers other sexualized content on twitch etc while macaiyla was completely fine with it and accused the other girls of hating on sex workers they got into a heated argument about it on the housewives podcast to where macaiyla was getting name called i believe by malena it caused macaiyla to not go on the podcast ever again edit qt was very out spoken agains it s really annoying that people just cant have a change of opinion any more
wow this summary is so inaccurate and is not at all what happened on the show lmao i m surprised people are upping this comment

with glistening fur and shimmering scales a creature of water and oceanic tales vaporeon i adore your aqueous grace your power your beauty shines in every place with fins and aqua jets you swim with ease gliding through currents with the greatest of ease aqua ring and hydro pump evoke aquatic splendor your moves pure poetry and a true epicenter i ask myself what more can i need in this liquid dream i plant my seed vaporeon you embody elegance and power as a pokemon you re a true shower ai professor oak
ai needs to be unplugged
all the pokemon streams he has done with this ai have been gold charborg was using it in re4 but with hunnigan instead of oak and it was also hilarious
hey guys did you know that in terms of male human and female pokmon breeding vaporeon is the most compatible pokmon for humans not only are they in the field egg group which is mostly comprised of mammals vaporeon are an average of tall and pounds this means they re large enough to be able handle human dicks and with their impressive base stats for hp and access to acid armor you can be rough with one due to their mostly water based biology there s no doubt in my mind that an aroused vaporeon would be incredibly wet so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore they can also learn the moves attract baby doll eyes captivate charm and tail whip along with not having fur to hide nipples so it d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood with their abilities water absorb and hydration they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water no other pokmon comes close to this level of compatibility also fun fact if you pull out enough you can make your vaporeon turn white vaporeon is literally built for human dick ungodly defense stat high hp pool acid armor means it can take cock all day all shapes and sizes and still come for more
awesome stream criken and charborg have been killing it with their content lately
damn i gotta start watching criken again
love this guy is still around making content i remember watching his old l4d content as a kid like a million times

would ve been better if it sounded like oak or at least an old man just straight up sounded like some year ol
even the ais are furries
funny clip neat use of ai this is a total sidebar but watching the streamer say i m gonna get banned made me aware of this weird part of twitch culture where band has become a meme it s kinda weird to imagine being banned for something silly funny like this yet it s based on the reality of how bad twitch s moderation is this is one area where a platform like kick could have an advantage
woahh that s a name i haven t heard in years
did you know
the true sin was rhyming ease with ease
with fins and aqua jets you swim _wherever you please _ gliding through currents with the greatest of ease fixed it
bravo
blame the degenerates on the internet the ai had to unfortunately learn from
is there a way to unread something
fyi is for feet and is for inches you have them reversed
imo the absolute golden era of youtube was like when criken and the gang way too many people to list were rping in games like friday the 13th scp sl barotrauma and more they don t do much content like that anymore unfortunately idubbbz filthyfrank and maxmoefoe were all making content together still too back then
it was trained on criken attempting a professor oak impression
i thought he was going to say something sexual the next sentence ending with knees
it s ingrained in your mind now you will think about it in your sleep now
if you have a neuralizer yes
i m just a humble copy paster i don t check the grammar
yeah we re lucky to get an scp lobby like once a year nowadays
yeah now i just watch chief and buck rp in gta instead
kinda sounds like patton oswalt
gliding through currents and being a tease

clip mirror hasan s reaction to seeing the fansly ad for the first time https://arazu.io/t3_12c4lrv/)** this is an automated comment
fansly is loving this so much free advertisement
this is what got lost in the stupid youtube and xqc crap spewing the real problem was twitch allowing this ad when it would have never been approved for any personal stream twitch had exclusive rights over the event and should have been approving or denying verbiage in the ads
fansly is like the sponsor for all twitch events your favorite streamer has probably been sponsored by fansly at some point
it is wild idk why people are trying to down play it so hard
is there really any difference in clicks when all these major streamers are basically just giving free publicity to the same ad they re shaming like x shit on it for hours yesterday but still watched it in full and brought it advertising with no on his stream lmao
i love how the fansly thing is only being brought up to deflect from other people s actions whether it be adin ross fans saying the pg streamers are hypocrites because they covered adin streaming straight up porn to viewers when they themselves promoted fansly or xqc train fans saying they re hypocrites because something something gambling the first argument is dumb for one there s a big difference between showing hardcore porn randomly to your viewers with no extra steps required vs a website that in order to actually see porn it s likely behind a paywall also who cares it s an easy way to dunk on a tate wannabe who s destroying his own career by going out of his way to be edgy while also not having the balls to be edgy in a way that isn t so inadvertently cringe the second thing is just sad every time something even remotely bad happens to one of the pg streamers regardless of how much of a nothing burger it is x and train go out of their way to somehow bring it back to this is why promoting gamba is okay and why everyone who criticized us for it is actually evil and bad faith gambling has been banned on twitch for almost a year it s old drama that no one even really cared about at the time they went out of their way to squash the sexual assault scandal beef which they also somehow made about gambling but they still hold the grudge over criticism for promoting gambling to their viewers if they re trying to sell the narrative of these other streamers are constantly coming at us and trying to take us down because they re bad faith actors they are doing a fucking terrible job all i see are two grown men with gambling addictions who come across as paranoid schizophrenic or both
wait this was all about an ad approved by twitch i thought this whole drama was about girls advertising their own fansly s
i have brain rot from this subreddit
oh shit i m early to a hasan drama thread can t wait to type some unhinged shit ok here it is is it a hasan thread or an hasan thread
hasan is watching ludwig and ludwig is watching moist and moist is watching the streaming awards
im confused you can advertise fansly on twitch but not onlyfans is that how it goes
gambling porn
what these conversations have taught me gambling ads would be fine as long as they don t show actual gambling content creators take whatever sponsers they can get because they re only trying to create these events for the community there s no profit motive zero spending your life savings on slots is much worse than spending it on an online sex worker it s too late to complain about fansly they ve been a stream sponser past the statute of drama limitations it s all about qt it s always all about qt seems to be a pattern having european parents provides a protective shield against porn
my heavens they show women in their unmentionables clutches pearls
not to dick ride but how does hasan point to train for promoting gambling which hasan was correct on but goes past qt to point at twitch for allowing this ad she took on the sponsorship read her script and let it play multiple times
idgaf about promoting it but what did weird me out is showing the profiles and some clips even if they had consent from the creators it just feels kinda weird to be like hey you know some streamers use fansly right come join fansly so you can see jimbob msnoscope turkeytom and bikiniandy flash their coochie and balls on our website
overall the content of this ad is so disgusting if it was saying something like hey on this website some people do porn but instead they precisely mention your favourite streamers are doing porn you run this ad on your stream then weird out how twitch female streamers are being objectified
hasan and xqc agreeing what is going on sneako was right we re in the matrix
except that you try going to the site not logged in and it doesn t show you anything just a login screen and an age gate that you can t bypass unless you are logged in there isn t anything to stumble onto by scanning a qr code
rules for thee and not for me
god i hate hasan s chat they just hate women
real
money talks
these people are all such spoiled brat high school drama hypocrites don t know how this made it on my front page find something better to do with your time people these folks are not your friends and you are wasting your precious time and money watching them
there s no problem with the ad there s no problem with the site the problem is that there s no proper age verification for actually joining the site
has he even watched the mukitty video i know he has links to her banned on the subreddit but is he so cowardly that he won t even watch the admittedly cringe and hilarious video that started all this
one of the things that mukitty talked about is how real reactions and opinions aren t expressed anymore and only the opinions that the people with highest status agree upon and hasan just proved that he refused https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1784609560?t=07h59m22s) to watch mukitty s video where it all started but watched his friends ludwig and moistcr1tikal answer to her video because why would her opinion matter she is not friends with mr beast and part of the hollywood of twitch
bro where the hell were you before you got called out now that everyone is doing it you want to switch stances he didn t care before
why i stopped supporting twitch
next on streamers flip flopping at the speed of light qt speaks out against the fansly add at the streamer awards
all of a sudden that there s popular backlash against this magically hasan sees this for the first time and shares the growing sentiment that it was weird shocker
hasan finally waking up to the double standards
first yeah first time my ass now that the drama is getting bigger and bigger he finally speaks about it
deleted
and neither do the pg steamers twitch hollywood inner circle
deleted
removed
hehehe welcome to the nasty truth
unrelated to this post i think but why has hasan been waving his handgun around on the stream like okay it s fake but isn t it a bad look am i missing some meme or something that ties it in
at least he can admit it plenty of people are doubling down or wiping their hands clean
is hasan reaction the right video with qt in it the video that criticize twitch streamers
i still don t get how this ad which shows literally explicit content is so bad but pool streams with actual porn stars isn t being talked about lol like kids teens can literally just google porn it s not like seeing an ad for fansly is going to suddenly make them porn addicts if anything fansly is much more restrictive compared to googling porn because it s behind a login and a paywall

where are the men
these poggers streamers really back pedaling now oh now it s a twitch issue
twitch is a dumpster fire of awful human beings full of hypocrisy running it
xqc is a liar and would ve noticed this the first time he saw this lmfaoooo
60k 30k and 15k live viewers from xqc hasan and charlie plus 3m and 500k views on youtube from charlie and mogul money it would have cost them millions to have this kind of promo
so much earned media from just one little ad i hope whoever created it are getting a big fat raise
ive been rolling in it and thanking the controversy gods
qt even said that there were people responsible for checking the ads
yeah it s very true the ultimate hypocrite in the situation is actually twitch they ban individual creators for advertising or directly linking to this type of content but allow the platform itself to do it blatantly talking about adult content and putting a qr code on screen
there s a term called due diligence which the streamers and twitch clearly failed to understand and act on it not only did twitch allow the ad twitch was a co sponsor for the streamer awards so they can t pull out a we weren t aware of this card which again shows twitch s hypocrisy
yea why us fansly allowed but streamersare not allowed to promote only fans the ad literally basically said yo come get your porn here twitch really needs to draw a line either allow content creators to sill adult content platforms or ban it
more like lsf just wanted a reason to hate on xqc
i just noticed reddit does the same thing with rumble you can t link to your rumble stream on reddit but there s literally an ad on the front page for rumblevideo
forsen
jerma xqc ludwig amouranth have all used fansly to sponsor there events
ludwig finally addressed this https://youtu.be/3snzbfx77ay) one thing he said is that sponsors have dried up the past years which is obvious because you know all of them probably would have liked less controversial help to produce chess boxing jerma baseball xqc show or the streamer awards was it worth it for those things up to the viewers fansly is one of the only steady sponsors
moon2m wrong
was twitch itself apart of those events
lol no because i watch destiny
xqc said porn is worse than gambling there is a conversation to be had about the exact ads that were ran and the access linking a twitch account gives on fansly without an age check but when one side is making it seem much worse than it really is its hard to get to those conversation points
that s because the streamer clique has the most ravenous parasocial fanbase in all of streaming
because nobody actually cares and if you do care enough to constantly argue about it on reddit you re in too deep enjoy the streams and move on with your life
will be interesting to see how many people here now good for hasan not trying to downplay it like moist did
because these streamers are on pr tour and their sheeps are going to agree to whatever their streamer say
it s not ideal but let s put it into perspective twitch itself will show the same streamers with less clothes in the bathtub section it s not that wild imo
have you not seen a mizkif or xqc stream brother replace ad with video of something they put themselves on stream or reacting to sure the ad is wild but lets not pretend like twitch viewers innocence are taken away its the cats out of the bag a loooong time ago
so what man it s just a sexually suggestive girl that s not bad that s not a wrong thing why y all so weird about this kind of stuff it s not evil
but it s about consent and that makes the ad ok
ironic isn t it lol
they re not unhappy they can t promote gambling gambling is still promoted on twitch its just that no one cares anymore because its not x or train i think x is just saying that gambling should be banned consistently not just a specific website just to appeal to public outrage similarly advertising sexually explicit content is prohibited by twitch guidelines yet nothing is done about it the issue isn t with qt x train or anyone else i think the issue is with twitch and their inconsistency
generally promoting adult content to kids such as gambling porn alcohol etc are seen to be generally bad because it causes poor mental health normalizing unhealthy attitudes and addiction in their early lives the criticism adin ross got which i agree is valid the portion of his audience are clearly seen as underage minor him showing porn full blown nudity does seem to be a problem because he is normalizing unhealthy behavior to his viewer in the context of promoting porn to children despite the big difference of showing full nudity and only show a nip pits of skin i still think that having to promote it on a stream with 400k views no age restriction and alot of different community coming together can possibly do more harm than what adin ross did for a streamer that virtue singal alot about how twitch should ban gambling and how xqc have to stop promoting gambling because his audiance are young it s just funny that this doesn t cause more outrage lastly i agree with x and train they cannot argue that promoting gambling is worse that porn gambling addiction is significantly way worse that porn addiction
why not just accept that all of it is bad instead of trying to stretch everything so your favorite streamers come out on top
there s a big difference for you between pay wall porn and outright porn but a person argue that they are the same bucket similarly for poker sports betting and slots people could draw a line but reality is people do get addicted to all of the above
they re still not allowed to do that lmao it s okay when twitch does it
yup this is the core issue you still can t advertise your personal fansly like if only fans made a sponsor deal with twitch that seems to be fine for them they just don t like when you cut the middle man
a hasan thread the name hasan starts with a consonant sound rather than a vowel sound compare for example a heartbeat and an heirloom
pretty based take from hasan this time
to be faaaaair gambling is way more harmful
correct but also the ad shows nothing pornographic so you can t really call it porn i remember the late night commercials for girls gone wild nsfw https://youtu.be/7zyskbcyepo) that were way more suggestive than this
yes unironically
yeah only a boomer would think porn is bad
it s just kinda weird that a streamer putting her fansily link in her bio will get banned for it but showing a full blown ad at a massive event is totally a ok
just keep that same energy when your teenage child is seeing similar ads on a streaming platform and decides to scan the qr code out of curiosity
because he fully supports sex work
i will never understand people like you who make a comment like this literally go to the website click login with twitch and you are in you make it sound like it s some magic when in reality it took me exactly clicks to get access at least invest seconds into that kinda shit if you are gonna make a comment like this and arguing about this topic gotta have some knowledge first before arguing you know
much like onlyfans
you can log in with your twitch and it bypasses any age gates
seriously how are you going to have a sfw ad that plays itself off like a social media site and then make the sign in stupidly easy through twitch and have zero true age verification so many children could easily accidentally end up there
there shouldn t be i shouldn t have to age verify to watch porn because clowns like hasan and xqc think we should cccp style internet parents can deal with it if they have an issue
that s not your problem that s not the problem of the streamer that s the problem of the website itself so quit hating on people like qt
no free clout the same reason hasan hasn t watched a single video that destiny has made of hasan in the past years
no point giving free clout and increasing the audience of a cringe twitch hypocrisy auditer with an axe to grind
why are you treating mukitty like a reputable source like her entire channel doesn t exist to farm juicers
hasan will take whatever position plays best currently on social media
people ever supported twitch never subbed never donated and i ve been on twitch since there was still a justin tv
yeah i m taking my money over to hotgirlscamsites com i m sick of twitch

impressive very nice now lets see forsen s card
fogo de chao needs to adopt those cards it would be way more interesting to have the green red card be a get it twisted or don t get it twisted

holy shit talk about rent free dude carries a picture of him seems obsessive
he could start selling those cards as merch
he would be dumb to say that now when hasan told train to his face that he gambled and train was flabbergasted meanwhile hasan has never kept this a secret and if train paid attention to what hasan said a year ago he would ve known that
bro hasan told a story about how he played slots i gotta play slots too now
he ll use this as a way to claim he started the gambling meta because he likes to claim metas when nobody gives a shit who starts a meta
good bot now lets see paul allen s card
it s a real dinkleberg complex
greek tragicomedy except turkish
honestly i really do believe the bridge could be rebuilt train just needs to be willing to eat an l or two and move forward i m not on either side they both have good and bad points
never met your heroes folks
if you go to fogo de chao and don t intend on getting it twisted what are you even doing
nah the card is flipped over so he s slapping train s ass
that s what i thought not that train needs the money but if he sold these as merch i d buy one he d probably make bank from it
dude carries around a picture of train as a joke good luck charm that serves as a reminder to never end up like train seems pretty funny to me
and plus it s not rent free when train literally will bring up some shit from the past just to keep the drama train alive between him and hasan i would too carry that card shit is hilarious
holy shit we got a hustlers university graduate over here
yeah train somehow thought it was a gotcha the original gamba debate even was about how people should be allowed to gamble if they wanted but being paid and advertising gambling is the bad part
you should also get it twisted then
your compliment was sufficient ___ bot ask me if i ve made any reservations opt out https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=botrickbateman&subject=opt%20out)
all i seem to want to do now is work out lifting weights mostly and secure reservations at new restaurants i ve already been to then cancel them ___ bot ask me what i m wearing opt out https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=botrickbateman&subject=opt%20out)
holy shit that exactly describes it
not having the scuffed podcast really pushed so many of these guys further away from each other and paranoia ate away at the bridges mostly trains doing of course sucks because there was a seemingly close knit community that included up and coming people from different categories all of which seems inconceivable nowadays
it s entirely up to train to rebuild but he refuses to concede anything
he is literally incapable of taking an l he built an entire site so he doesn t have to take an l
train has repeatedly said before that he thinks hasan and roshtein for that matter is a good person overall he has always stated there s a scenario where they build a friendship he s just decided to die on the hill he s chosen
definitely criminal behavior
what are you wearing
it s the most spot on description i could ever visualize lmao
why did he end the scuffed podcast
the air conditioning in the restaurant is on full blast and i m beginning to feel bad that i m not wearing the new versace pullover i bought last week at bergdorfs it would look good with the suit i m wearing ___ bot ask me who i can see opt out https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=botrickbateman&subject=opt%20out)
because he didn t need it anymore scuffed raj was a way to gain popularity by having other popular streamers on they bring most of their audience so you have a chance to gain new viewers once he hit the steak sponsorship he was rich so it wasn t worth the effort anymore don t get me wrong it s not just about the money with these people they are narcissists at heart so their ego drives them to keep streaming but hosting a show like that requires a lot of work so it s just not worth it

i die of embarrassment for this man every time i see his name pop up
can t wait for qt to somehow make this about her
this dude is a clown lol made an unnecessary video crying with his wife also sobbing in the background lmao funniest vid hands down
worst thing he s done to maya all year poor bird girl
surely he owes us at least supplementary marketing mondays at this point
he s going to do a catch up mega monday for all the content we missed
in a recent stream he talked about going to see a movie with ludwig and i think mentioned he already watched one with stanz so it seems they re past it obviously though the internet never forgets so we ll see if they stream together again
he barely fucked up qt just made it a massive big deal by going live to cry this is what pain looks like oh thanks millionaire streamer i ll keep that in mind
meh he s done a lot of good work to show his remorse while it s not up to us to forgive him i think he s shown enough at this point that this was just a dumb stupid fuck up and not character defining
literally the only one making it about qt is you mate nothing in this clip is about qt and your first thought is i wonder how this bitch is going to make it about her
its and klayb is still waiting for qt to respond to that one clip on lsf back in
eh for him it hurt a lot more being friends with the people that got deepfaked maybe he shouldn t of handled it that way on stream but i can understand why he was so upset so i dont really find it funny
you re a dick huh
i personally couldn t live this one down knowing my friends and wife wouldn t look at me the same way i think it s both a stupid and character defining to watch deepfake porn of your friends and wife s friends since it s just a side effect of some deeper rooted issues i do feel for the guy that he has to be known as the deepfake porn guy for the rest of his career and the embarrassment alone seems punishment enough
no i m just not a delusional streamer with main character syndrome
honestly in the couple streams he s had recently it does sound like he has a really good support group i personally agree and don t think i could live it down but his wife and friends do genuinely seem really supportive behind the scene and i think that helps a lot
side effect of what deep rooted issue exactly fantasizing about attractive people in your life i got bad news for you friend
that s fair if i ever get the gull to watch him then i ll try with open mind
fantasizing is one thing externalizing it so much to the point that you re consciously putting effort to make that fantasy come true is another thing who knows how deep the rabbit hole would have gone if he didn t get caught lol if i found my friend with photoshopped pictures of my wife and my friends wives our friendship would never be the same the silver lining is that he s helped bring down deepfake porn sites but it s silly to say this was just a normal thing that anyone would do
i completely agree externalizing it is messed up and what he did was messed up i just don t find it indicative of a deeper issue and think of it more as a mistake and sometimes mistakes can change relationships like that
fair enough
i don t understand how it s not indicative of a deeper issue the state of mind you have to be in to pay for and view ai deepfake porn of your own acquaintances cannot be normal or even remotely healthy the dude is very likely addicted to porn if he was my friend i d never look at him the same again and if he was looking at ai deepfake porn of my wife i d likely never even speak to him again
ya i think this is the more general opinion from people living outside twitch world but it s clear we got atrioc fan club working overtime
by this logic isn t any mistake indicative of a deeper issue i mean what state of mind do you have to be in to say gamble at a casino or drink a soda or any number of dumb ass things we do to chase dopamine my point isn t that i think atrioc is a flawless human with no issues it s that i don t think he has some fundamental flaw that makes this behavior inevitable i ve gone down rabbit holes i m not proud of and that i ve never repeated and they weren t publicized and didn t cause insane humiliation or damage my career lol as far as relationships i ve seen much worse be reconciled but that s really between him and his friends i know i have some friendships that this would break and others that it wouldn t based on what i know of them and how deep the friendship goes
i don t think it s just atrioc fans working overtime i think a lot of people on here don t want to admit that they too might have a porn problem so they defend atrioc in order to justify their own actions to themselves it s sad though i used to be a huge atrioc fan but it s just not the same anymore
or drink a soda my guy i know you re not comparing paying for ai generated porn of your acquaintances to drinking a soda by this logic isn t any mistake indicative of a deeper issue this isn t just any mistake though the guy wasn t just watching porn he was watching ai deepfake porn of his acquaintances and he wasn t just watching it he also paid for it and he did all of this on a fucking work computer that is several degrees of degeneracy deep to take your casino analogy it would be more like someone gambling away their own friend s money all the while lying to their wife about the fact that they re at a casino i ve seen much worse be reconciled but that s really between him and his friends i know i have some friendships that this would break and others that it wouldn t based on what i know of them and how deep the friendship goes which is why i specified that i wouldn t look at him the same if i were his friend and if he lusting this way after my wife i probably wouldn t speak to him again and i think most sane people in the real world outside of twitch would react this way but i do recognize that some wouldn t
you talk about the real world like it s somehow less degenerate i ve seen friendships and relationships survive passes made or even straight up cheating which is miles away from this although i admit it is rare have you really never heard someone drunkenly tell a friend their so is hot you think there s no lusting going on there if it s a pattern and this has happened before and he keeps saying he ll stop but he doesn t etc that s addict behavior that s where you start cutting people out but a one time thing and otherwise he s been a good friend i dunno i m willing to forgive a lot

my favorite was the one written into the kotaku article

what was the average lol
jebait
this one s great but i still consider the ad break during the hasan train xqc debate the best one had me dying of laughing
it s always the best when someone else gets it and pulls a fast one over him chatter
man its been one hell of a year for ad breaks first hasan hits us with that legendary segue during the trainwreck debate and now a chatter pulls this idk what can top it
best capitalist on twitch

hasan is the don draper of twitch no one advertises more than him if his streaming career ever goes to shit he will get a job on madison ave easily
socialist btw

ez clap chatters
actually good one
most of his chatters are pretty cool tbh but its fun when he makes examples of the morons in his chat


anyone have the clip
wait they re mins now
thats enough time to get up touch some grass piss and get a glass of water
poor socialist isn t making enough millions a year to buy all his expensive clothes and jewelry
you must not know what twitch is
mfw every partnered streamer run ads
you realize hassan asked his community about it and his chat chose to have top of the hour ads right but i guess he forgot to ask u totomartial from reddit if they were ok with this monetization method to support free leftist content creation
sigh everyone with a twitch contract has to run a certain amount of ads per hour he claims to run the least amount he contractually can which i do believe and the top of the hour ad break takes a majority of this per hour ad time what exactly is the issue with top of the hour at least you know when to expect it
clown world bro
you re right it s sycophantic behavior and legitimately sad to see
lol you can t just say that in here on a hasan thread anyway it s just a meme https://www.reddit.com/r/livestreamfail/comments/pxixrq/50k_subs_hasan_complaining_about_not_making_money/)
yea imagine having a community that interacts in a positive way with the streamer very cringe i prefer shitting and clowning on my favourite streamer all day because i want everyone else to be as miserable as i am also socialism is when poor
nice bait
classic too wait a minute
please no anti hasan posts here on the hasan subreddit thx
manual ads are way better than automated ads this way the streamer if they aren t scumbags can pause any actual content during the ads and continue after
you mean as opposed to automated he chose it bc it s more fun for him and his community to do jebaits and it s less disruptive to the overall content for ppl who can t afford a membership he had the community vote about it when his contract forced him to a higher ad density and the chat still voted for top of the hour ad breaks
we all love a public execution from time to time
hasan getting riled up is about of the entertainment

possibly the highest ever there was another one a few days ago that was also super high but i think this one beats it
here https://clips.twitch.tv/tastycuriousradicchiothething-03tscgbs2dq6bctg
couldn t keep it at min after last year renew everyone s ad periods went up
technically it s there s a minute ad in the middle of the hour
bro not only that imagine not having ad block in
hasan has an exclusive contract with twitch so he has an ad quota normal twitch partners can pick and choose when midrolls run manually or through a bot or they can opt for no mid rolls but have prerolls preroll ads at start then ad free for rest of stream as long as you don t exit out
he never had to accept the ad deal it was his choice to make more money just remember that
it s like these people want to soo badly believe hasan isn t a disgusting capitalist but anytime a topic relating to his own career lifestyle is in frame he will make it apparent he is while his sheep of an audience are too blind to realize the hypocrisy you can believe in socialism btw without supporting your socialist benevolent cult streamer who will preach these methodologies knowing full well his lifestyle won t be affected the ignorance
if you aren t loudly proclaiming your hate for hasan at every opportunity you re a fanboy rrreeeeeeeeeee
plus prerolls are fucking cancer and running your own ads makes them not happen apparently
deleted
it has to be closer to if you join his stream at any given moment he is going to have a minute video paused for an hour straight while yelling at chat if you re the kind of person that needs to see the end of that video his stream is literal torture

austin managed to get a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgcwilg0hli
there was the one a kotaku writer put in an article they wrote about hasan
oh yeah he had the train debate ad that was impeccable cause he was in the heat of the moment
thanks
why do i get serious mountain dew verification can vibes from reading this comment
even with adblocking it s still annoying since it makes the stream stutter and pause unpause a few times which can also delay the stream by a few seconds bringing it out of sync with the chat and sometimes reduces volume level regardless of the actual volume setting so i need to refresh to fix it and maybe it s just me but it seems like the emotes menu when you type in chat bugs out and stops showing bttv emotes after stream temporarily freezes due to an ad starting so have to refresh to fix that too
okay but there d still be ads running dumbass
again based on what he s said he specfically asked for a lower amount of ads which to my understanding twitch is running more to compensate for the lower ad split from a few months back and every twitch partner and affiliate has to run ads not seeing your point there
if any streamer doesn t accept a partner contract then they stay an affiliate where twitch gets to run more ads via mid rolls and they can t even control when the ads gets played interrupting their stream sounds like you haven t thought this through
socialism is when perceived hypocrisy
the ignorance of not understanding the absolute basics of humanities most impactful system you will ever know in your entire life a capitalist makes money via having capital not from making content and recieving subscriptions
this would actually be a good funny comment if you weren t a hasan fanboy yourself
twitch is making all partnered streamers run at least minutes of ads per hour now there are some streamers who only have to do until their current contract runs out unless there s other outliers i don t know about it was a one two punch they did a while ago simultaneously slashing partnered streamers sub splits while making them run more ads additionally if a streamer doesn t run enough ads then it ll enable pre roll ads for them since running ads is inherently disruptive to livestream content not enough streamers were running ads to satisfy twitch amazon they also increase the streamer ad split a bit but i think it s a net pay cut i agree that twitch shouldn t do that but that s how it is rn
amazon puts ads on your shit whether you re contracted or not at least this way he has some control over it he has like a him twitch split on ads anyway so its not like they even make him shit most of his money is subs
amazon has told every creator to run ads or they will i think amo was only one to get out of it because of the booba so all creators on twitch have to run ads or the software will do it out side their control
if he could have it his way he wouldn t run ads at all he used to do hour streams without ads and only running them at the end of the stream
yea cus socialism is when no ads
they didn t force him he signed a contract and has to fulfill it that s how the grown up world works you do the job you were contracted to do in this case it s running ads
it s money for papa bezos
i hate ads i have turbo but do you expect a company to provide free bandwidth and a platform for free ads are one way the company monetises their expenses
that s literally how i found him and thought he was just extremely angry all the time but he s just passionate about his beliefs and some people refuse to have reasonable takes

we don t deserve austin
i think that one was
doritos tm dew tm it right
uh
jeez that sucks idk that doesnt happen to me im not home until tomorrow evening usa but i ll update my comment when i get home and see which ab i have if you re interested
same thing here with the stutter pause it also doesn t work for prerolls for me but it feels weird to complain about it since for the most part it does what it s supposed to and most of the streamers i follow are conscientious and stop the action during ads if possible i found there s a bit less of a stutter if you re running the stream in lower quality as well as the proxy s quality but it s not a big difference
nah but it s not about materiliasm and living the life of a consumerist la rich boy i don t give a shit it s much funnier watching you all defend it
oh look he s doing exactly that thing i said they do sorry you re right dude hasan is actually stalin reincarnated and we can t keep letting him get away with it
it s infinitely better to get warned about an ad break than get it in the middle of content if i m gonna get 8ads slapped together the heads up is appreciated so i can go take a quick shit or grab a quick chocolate snack
i actually just watched an early fear of him and ludwig and connor where he said he only gets a split on his ads that was before the new contract but i m sure it s not much better
deleted
but why cant they have youtube style why does it have to be 4x30 sec ads
it took a while but i eventually realized that he doesn t snipe dumb chatters because he doesn t like their takes he snipes them to create an opportunity to make a point he already wanted to make

oh look he s doing exactly that thing i said they do lol no i m not and i don t hate hasan i just think he s a bit of a dumbass who i enjoy laughing at with annoying followers worshippers like you who i also enjoy laughing at lol it s funny that people get so defensive about a streamer they watch sorry you re right dude hasan is actually stalin reincarnated and we can t keep letting him get away with it yes keep making up my arguments and views out of thin air doesn t make you seem unhinged and without an actual legitimiate point at all well done
this is the piece of information that made train and especially xqc s allegations that hasan is an ultra millionaire and can afford to easily drop 50k donos every time fucking hilarious don t get me wrong hasan is filthy rich but he s shared his ad splits with other ccs and they ve clowned him on how shit his contract is he purposefully negotiated for the lowest possible ad density at the expense of a shit ad split he also notably only got a credit card a few years ago as a means to build his credit score to get a mortgage for his house this dude doesn t invest and is too much of a himbo to invest
you are waaaaaay more transparent than you think
that s arguably a separate issue from what enfrozt was complaining about i imagine there are many issues challenges with implementing youtube style ads including the complexity of the contracts with advertisers the remuneration structure around skippable ads etc i do believe that the twitch ad experience makes it very hostile to the adoption of new users though specially pre roll ads
that s what i don t get i guess it s just bc they can twitch must get a better cpm for that tho
clip mirror nl talks about the feelings of attachment that develop while raising a child https://arazu.io/t3_12buprq/)** this is an automated comment
sunk cost fallacy smh
but have they changed the camel
he s completely right i ve been through this same situation with my tomato plants
i wish nl was my dad
my husband was like this and it didn t help that our son was in the nicu for 3mos he couldn t bond with our son and i told him well you ll love him once he starts laughing and able to see better sure enough as i said i remember when i first saw it happen and i knew they just clicked for the first time man i m about to cry remembering bonding with a newborn is hard because at that moment is just helping it survive but once they start showing their emotions and expressions it is really hard not getting attached
it was i that asked that and i didn t mean to butt in on his moment and i look even stupider from not seeing it was a dromedary funny tho
shame he lost attachment to his other children josh
had a kid around the same time because that s how parasocial i am and i completely agree the feeling just stacks and stacks over time
yeah it s normal to not be immediately in i will kill everyone and everything to protect you mode right at the start you get this weird alien that comes out of your wife girlfriend and it s constantly crying shitting pissing itself and eating and sleeping eventually the baby grows up over the next few weeks and things begins to change and then it hits you i had the same reaction to my nephews when they were born at first there isn t a person there there s no personality etc it s just a doll you have to keep alive until it evolves like pokmon lol but now i would do anything for them and they aren t even my kids
this is such an incredibly take for parents to understand i hope more people realize this
my wife has admitted to me that she was upset originally that i wasn t like in love with our son when he was born i think she and many other people was under the impression that it s like when barney sees his daughter in himym https://youtu.be/ies5tuzta9u?t=18) for the first time she didn t take into account that she had been feeling and bonding with our son for nine months in the womb before i got to even meet him by that time she had felt every kick every roll every wake up every hiccup everything she got a nine month headstart in developing a bond with him before i got to meet him meanwhile from my point of view the first time i truly got to meet him was when he was covered in a lot of crazy fluids crying a ton then i had to wait months because babies don t really develop a personality for a while that s all to say that as a father your time bonding with your kid starts so much later than the mother and it s okay if you are confused at the lack of love you feel right away spend as much time as you can with them and it will develop too just like nl says in the clip you become ride or die with them so quickly
one of the things i m afraid of when i have a kid in the future is maybe when it happens i ll just completely regret it and now i m stuck being a dad raising a kid i don t love
adding my anecdotal experience to say i strongly agree i felt defective as i didn t feel overwhelmingly attached to my daughter at first thankfully i read quite a bit and was aware that s not uncommon at all it actually took about months before i felt very strongly about her but then it grew to the point that you often hear others describe where you can t believe the love you feel for your child it s unlike anything else completely
kind of weird that no one mentioned it but has anyone else notice that he seems to be bald
appeal to emotion
nl clips are always solid gold i don t like what he plays enough to watch him regularly but i genuinely think every clip i see of him is a breathe of fresh air
it s funny this is kind of how i feel about his streams i didn t instantly like him his taste in games doesn t quite match my own he s a little abrasive sometimes but the more i watch him the more i appreciate him and his humour recently subscribed to a nl clips channel and some of them had me pissing myself laughing
sounds like stockholm syndrome tbh
he s trying to justify why he has no paternal instincts cool

yeah but what about the camel
funny ethan klein said the same thing just last week
essentially the last of us
what are you talking about luna is going to the moon
he basically described a binding of isaac run truly dogshit at the start you slowly get attached to your run then you have to let it go once it s all finished
listen it s an level mosquito on turn you can t just get rid of it it s got a pineapple
i wish i could watch him react to this comment
stockholm syndrome smh
any truers
they added option to select alternative pics for each friend
found malf
i wish you would be my stepbro
but then you would have the egg genes
would you trade your hair for him to be your dad tho
that s how it was for me with my kid first month or two are rough but when they gain the ability to smile at you everything changes and you can t even begin to describe the love you feel for them
dromedary and bactrian are the two types of camel dromedary have one hump and bactrian have two like the first letters of their names
now if only he could confirm or deny whether he is gonna be on champions of fire or not we would be gucci i m having nightmares over his incredibly hostile karate chop to this day i expect trump to trade what he knows about squeex for a shorter sentence any day now so i hope at least one of my streamers will still be around
i wouldn t worry too much about it man haha if he didn t wanna read it he wouldn t have just part of hyperbolizing for comedic effect
he abandoned future josh right after meeting him as well just goes to show people can grow
and he s bald
baby scaling goes hard every round
the multiplier is crazy dude
had a friend of mine go through the same thing he ended up getting really bad depression in the first months after his first son from not feeling that love right away i m really glad nl is opening up about this because i really don t think they should have changed the camel and also he s bald
i found this out for myself on accident but i now always recommend to new dads to change every diaper you re there for it may seem silly but it gives you special time with your baby and really does help you bond with them and your partner will feel one tiny bit less stressed knowing you have this
that s why you gotta be sure you want a kid i don t blame you though because people have voiced the same worries about parenting a child with severe mental handicaps at that point you re suddenly thrust into the world of full time caregiving it s brutal and borderline psychotic to think about but that s the reality of the situation and why you have to be absolutely sure you can handle something like that
if it makes you feel any better us humans are absolutely hardwired to love their babies its one of the main ways we evolved so that people actually raise their babies up to the point they can take care of themselves instead of just ditching them at like years old
sooo true

new moon record
for some reason the animals and the word friend reminded me of happy tree friends and now i am wondering why that existed when it existed there is no way it was playing on tv somewhere and i doubt it was very profitable back then to spend l that time to animate to post something on youtube or maybe it was it does feel like years have passed since then or something
egg is ok
that s useful real world knowledge but in case you re not familiar with the game dromedary and camel are distinct units
turns out chiblee was just future josh in disguise
no he s not
can you tell this to my dad
it played on late night g4 but it started as just early internet media created as the internet rush started to pick up around so more like years now but it actually got like million plays each month pre youtube even existing which was pretty insane back then so it continued on for like ten years
they made money via reruns ad revenue and merch article https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/cuddly-cartoons-bleed-for-money-web-animators-2678978.php) homestarrunner is another titan of the era that relied solely on merch article https://www.looper.com/140935/the-untold-truth-of-homestar-runner/#:~:text=the%20brothers%20were%20never%20big,with%20their%20favorite%20online%20heroes.) i doubt the brothers chaps made i ll never work another day in my life money though since they eventually reentered the workforce from their wikipedia through homestar runner remained financially viable for the brothers through sales of related merchandise both brothers were married by and had their children to care for and they recognized that they would need to find other jobs to support their respective families

does mondo still exist or did it die off after happy tree friends
they were gonna do a movie in like of happy tree friends but i haven t seen anything about it since and their last blog https://mondomedia.com/news) post is from so i d assume not they got a decent years with the following being slower until it kinda just slowed to a halt haven t looked into it too deep though perhaps some part of mondo branched and joined another group etc

those yellow things on the sidewalk are very slippery when they re wet same way connor fell
i felt that
legend hit the cop that came to help him with the classic tokyo kara to distract him from breaking one of the titles on the ground
i like rob but i wish he played music and sub alerts to the stream and wireless earphones rather than out loud through speakers

who
what was the cause is it that sewer cover circle thing or the slippery yellow stuff
incredibly old stand up from kat williams about it https://youtu.be/w1zpdfckuzs) only thing about bikes that i keep in mind
yep always cross them don t do what rob did and ride parallel to them
why
slippery yellow stuff
good video but i think you two are talking about different kinds of yellow lines
it s a bit antisocial people don t want to hear other people s music
they are one is like braille painted yellow lines and the other motorway dotted lines but the same idea still tracks due to the paint causing a more slippery surface for rubber less grip
i was assuming the lines in the sidewalk were slippery because they look like some kind of separate material from the rest of the sidewalk but now i have no clue
i m pretty sure they are a different material it s like a hard plastic grill i ve eaten shit on an escooter in the exact same way as cdawg and rob those things are deadly when wet

what s shocking about this is fanfan not instinctively clicking the in the comment but going up to manually go to that point
yeah i ve watched to much anime i can tell that s marin cosplay from my dress up darling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwrxj0m4b1g
hah i love watching reactions to content from funnier people
is she putting her skin through a filter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zujit9agb1u) it s blurred and there is no texture
pan piano has the best comments
she s the amouranth of pianists
oh hey it s panpiano
more talented than a reaction streamer
i prefer ru s piano precisely because she doesn t make the focus of the video her body not that i don t sometimes enjoy looking at boobas but it s almost too jarring
check out im leezy if you like piano
it s strange and sad that she is doing this to capture views in order for people to see her talent bc it s pretty good
i love pan piano
are they wrong tho

batchest fuck i love reaction streams with personality batchest
the type of youtuber who complains about horny guys in the comment section
i love living in a world where this is allowed im thankful everyday i wasnt born in the fucking medieval era feelsgoodman
oh my my my my
why is she blown out of the water like that dont most of her friends and colleagues do this but with out the piano
pan piano s type of content changed so much from her earlier days lmao guess it s obvious what gets views
people really do enjoy the music at that timestamp https://i.imgur.com/ornhn2m.png
https://youtu.be/rmmugfizudw probably the second
huh i was already subscribed to this channel
lol
never seen a and i never fuckin will
me and fucking mark rtzou
my insane pace
when you click on a timestamp for youtube it auto scrolls she did not manually scroll she clicked the timestamp proof the cords playing during this clip do not match with the cords directly before the transition at in the original video therefore the video was not just randomly at that point link to the cords at https://youtu.be/1jpunaycs2o?t=70) these cords have a gloomy feel to them but none of these cords were played during the twitch clip from fanfan therefore she did not manually scroll
i don t think she is manually clicking the video just happens to be at that point when she scrolls up
and the number of streamers who don t know that you can press and to move yt videos frame by frame
think she did click the comment but we just didn t see the cursor
right
no shot i just recognized an anime character by their fucking bikini colors please someone forcibly shove grass on my face
nah it was a great show you have good taste
there s clear see through fabric on the lower part of the dress she s wearing in that video so that s why unless you re talking about her arms
if you re referring to the cutout in her dress side it looks like there s see thru material there through at least her mid thigh the front of the dress wouldn t stay perfectly in place without it and you can see folds along the edges on the inside so you aren t actually looking at bare skin if you re referring to her arms and above i think it s just because she s very pale and has bright white lighting to wash out any color or blemishes she might have i wouldn t completely rule out some kind of touch up or editing since i m not an expert and her image is her main selling point but she moves her arms and especially her hands way too much for any kind of generic filter to keep up with perfectly so i m inclined to think it s just favorable lighting
from the wiki she brightens the skin with the so called actor lighting which makes the lighting very bright her skin is not dark but it is very different from her skin color when she played the piano in the early days
i don t care but i love that song thanks for linking rip david
why does it even matter
not really she actually has some talent
fake booba
hadnt even watched the clip yet but you can recognise the coomer bait pianist from anywhere
ruru s arrangements are a bit more pleasing to listen to also not so blatant booba
pan piano is pretty much just coomer farming at this point she s still talented at piano but it s obvious what her focus actually is these days
there are a lot of people with her musical talent level on youtube but she has the views
honestly there s tons of people that can cover songs as well or even better unless you re incredibly talented and you are doing something very special with the music eg animenz piano sheets there s tons of other people competing for the same views she s talented but so are thousands of other people
if you go back like years in her upload history it s just normal clothing sex sells and channel stonks grow
its the same reason we have those clickbait thumbnails tons of good content creators with equal talents need to figth for every single bit of advantage so people look at their videos then the videos of the competition
sex sells it always has and it always will
she s my favourite guitar player over the entire internet
she s just not that great compared to many people doing piano on youtube she constantly miss cords not a music expert but i know what my weeb songs are supposed to sound like and the songs sounds warped a better pianist would be for instance ru piano same gist just less skin
fanfan no personality
you think this is that type of youtuber
it s all about the grind and she knew obviously what the internet want
deleted
reminds me of lara that aussie chick that learned and played songs by ear instantly started off wholesome now does onlyfans because the money is ridiculous
i respect it she got the skills and the goods to pay the bills
to illustrate what you re saying i took this screenshot of her yt channel here https://i.imgur.com/hiqsdka.jpeg). there s quite a big gap before cosplay and after cosplay like it s quite significant tbh
baby till the day i fucking die
good work detective
chords
but you can hear the mousewheel scrolling
she didn t click the time stamp she scrolls up at the mark of the clip so of the video matches also if you look when she start scrolling up the cursor appears automatically in the middle of the screen not to the left were the time stamp is
i don t think she knew it s there she was going to manually find if it wasn t
to be fair a lot of her identity is seemingly that bikini
i mean i hardly watch anime and even i recognized it that character was everywhere for a while
why did you watch my dress up darling to begin with dude if i ve ever heard the name of a hornybaiting anime shut in it would be that show
her arms look so different to years ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db63j7zsc7a) in her older videos she has skin texture and you can see she has a few spots on her right arm so i think it s a combination of lighting and a filter
her older videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db63j7zsc7a) have different lighting and you can see that she has some spots on her arms and has skin texture so i think it s a combination of white lighting and a filter
what wiki
it matters to me bruh _
the point that i am making is that this is the reason she has the views which is fine but kind of sad because of what it brings when showing this vanilla soft shit yk what i mean just to clarify we are talking about the pianist right
ru piano on youtube still has views over 2m subs and she doesn t have to get naked
sex sells and channel stonks grow exactly a little bit of talent often isn t enough to pay the bills
and shes great at it
well yes and no being forced to use your body to stay competitive has to be degrading
lara6683 i didn t watch her that much but i would not have expected her to be someone who does of good for her tho
what a rush
yea i hear that too but it doesn t do anything she hit the timestamp so it auto scrolls up for her no matter what even if she tried to scroll down we know she had to have hit the timestamp because the song skips from about seconds in to exactly the video player timeline shows the video at before the scroll even finishes
how can you be so confidently wrong lol why would her cursor appear randomly in the middle of her screen when she starts scrolling up how do you explain the skip in chords played in the song piece here s the first frame once her cursor show up on stream https://gyazo.com/2654a276ce68a7f314995c5f2a8ce9d4) it s clearly very close to the timestamp comment as close as you are going to get with a fps twitch stream and a disappearing and reappearing cursor again my first comment is all the evidence you need the song skips from seconds to stop using twitch clip timestamps and go to the actual video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jpunaycs2o&t) it s not physically possible to manually switch to while scrolling and the audio proves that there was a skip in the song edit also i presume her cursor only appears in the first place because she clicked the on the hyperlink timestamp if she scrolled up her cursor would have remained invisible
as a tier sub i know exactly what she was going to do
which is kinda funny considering she only ever wears it for one episode chapter and never again cosplayers just wear it because they know horny weebs will click
it s actually a pretty wholesome romcom lots of tittes and ass but that just makes it better imo
are you aware of the concept of lighting and color correction
the lighting is quite different
i think you re just underestimating what regular household lighting looks like vs studio lighting you can even see in the cyberpunk video how much her arms look different around with her right front and center under the lights and her left in the corner with a lot more shadows i don t see any aberrations that would come from a filter her skin matches the shadows and her movements exactly
why you think ppl watch hot tub streamers bro cmon
hey at least this takes more skill than sitting on a pool writing names of donos on your skin and doing squats like the other guy said there is a lot of people on yt playing piano and shit but shes using this to her advantage make money queen slay and blah blah blah
i agree with you that i think it s a bit sad however if she s okay with it and is okay with doing it isn t pressured to do it then all the power to her that being said i ve often wondered why youtube and twitch don t have a better way to find new and rising content based on various categories you could search for different results so instead of just showing the top videos streamers you would see a variety of promoted content which you would think would create more revenue for these platforms by having more popular content creators overall they would be able to show more ads get more users engaging with their sites for longer
yea and unlike many content creators she actually has this option so weird when people go how sad she needs to do this not realising there are thousands that don t make it because they don t have that option
she s not really forced to though no there s other anime piano cover channels who don t do that at all and are doing just fine
i m so confused who s being forced here she chose to sell sex along with her piano skills i ll agree that maybe she was pressured into doing that by views and coomers but let s not act like she was forced to also by your logic wouldn t it be better to be a female pianist then cause then at least you have the possibility of selling your body to stay competitive whereas if you re a male creator you simply don t have that opportunity
weird comment poor lady is forced to show titties when those other pianists getting easy views by just being very skilled and smart with their gimmicks its unfair also its always funny to imply women wont do stuff like this out of their will and are only doing it because theres some systemic flaw forcing them
her old vids were also getting hundreds of thousands of views if anything she s probably a leading contributor to the problem you re imagining instead of a victim

isn t that more about wanting to meet someone who is part of a specific culture pretty sure most white people wouldn t qualify as cowboys either
i get why he thinks this but it s actually not true there s a good amount of hispanic cowboys too and even black cowboys though admittedly not common but i mean cowboys as we think of them today literally began with a mix of hispanic and native american s way of ranching in the texas mexico area and the americans interacting with them nearby growing up in the south you see it pretty regularly i m not a cowboy but i am black and from the south and my high school had a ton of people growing up on ranches maybe slightly over half of the cowboy population there was white i had black friends that were cowboys i know squeex doesn t have any negative intent regarding race with this comment but what he said is one of those things that wouldn t fly for any other race s stereotype imagine a girl puts i like the thug type and he commented just say you like black guys though maybe it s more offensive to hispanics to think that a cowboy must be white
who is this guy and why is he suddenly on lsf so often
not necessarily https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyon_f2pyvw)
the reruns still slap
if squeex spaces them out properly he ll be the next clintstevens but actually streaming
eternal squeextember
wait what lmao
he s part of the austin illuminati now so he s getting attention at least he s actually funny though
he s definitely the cutest one yet
not all white ppl are cowboys but all cowboys are white except lil nas x
cause he s funny and super hot
typical lsf girl of the month
he has a contest in his discord where the person who gets the most updoots on lsf gets to see his hog
otk industry plant s
it really happened like that i was there during filming
ok but that doesn t really change what i am saying
this isn t true he will show his hog to anyone at any time it s why he was fired from his last job he kept pressing it against the conference room windows whenever there was a meeting
ya ya you are refusing to just hear joke and giggle and want to make it some deeper conversation the problem with
yeah that s the problem with lol if it s just a joke then that s fine but would suck if a part of squeex is upset about it
obviously a part of him is upset about it that s why he made a joke out of it that s how you cope with things that upset you when you re not a fucking underdeveloped moron

bruh who donates bits to the millionaire f1 driver
maybe he is just leaking the script for this year
based lando
all the comments talking about ad21 when he was actually talking about turkey and hamilton winning his 7th but accidently said 8th
everyone on the grid probably thinks lewis got robbed in broad daylight
i mean he was literally robbed in broad daylight by michael masi
based lando
any loremasters
lando knows too
when people say stuff like this its not like their trying to say max was shit or didnt deserve it etc he ofc deserved the title he had a better year than lewis imo but he still would have lost the championship if the multiple rules that have been in place for years had been followed correctly which they werent
well hamilton might be a time world champion if massa gets his way first championship of hamilton also had some questionable stuff happening with the crashgate race not being scrapped
dam that is cool collection
chance he is just saying that to fuck with max
lando said fuck max
wow these comments commonly mention max dick riders but all i see is lewis having one down everyones throat lol
its and hamilton fans are still crying about this
when people say stuff like this its not like their trying to say max didnt deserve it etc he ofc deserved the title he had a better year than lewis imo but he still would have lost the championship if the multiple rules that have been in place for years had been followed correctly which they werent

i agree lando
even without the 8th hamilton still has the most championships in my eyes his to schuhmacher s like fuck will i ever credit schumi for the one he won by purposefully crashing in to damon hill on the final race

this is exactly why he stopped streaming back in the day lol its gotta be difficult for him tho cause he s very good friends with max but also looks up to lewis
comments no michael no
lmao at all the comments fan boying for one driver or the other as someone who isnt a fan of either max or lewis the decision to do the last lap to decide the championship was dumb but the whole season was riddled with dumb and inconsistent decisions buy the fia and stewards if anything the ridiculous call was consistent with the rest of the seasons shit decisions
no michael no no
max won the overall season without doubt lewis won that race said from a verstappen supporter
oh man he can say goodbye to his sim racing teammate max verstappen
well then we should remove his crashgate title too which would put him on titles again
i thought i was in r formula1 boy are you lsf nerds in for story time
miami gp helmet was god tier design and the arai box
lewis hamilton was about to win his 8th world title when the race director masi decided to invent some new rules in order to have a last lap race to decide the championship hamilton would have won under the proper rules so saying hamilton won his 8th is controversial to the people that wanted him to lose and like to pretend that the race director didn t break the rules
as opposed to donating bits to any other millionaire streamer
they re trying to buy him out of that trash mclaren contract
lot of idiots
the rich get richer
somebody gave like gifted subs too
how much is that anyway
bruh who still gives a fuck about this its been talked for ages
it s not a donation you guys are foolish to think anytime you give money to a streamer it is a donation
mercedes sill not fast enough sadly
that s the point hamilton only technically has wdc but a lot of people say he has because of abu dhabi lando saying 8th makes it seem like he also thinks hamilton has wdc which is why he reacted the way he did because he knows it will just cause drama
t h a t s t h e j o k e
if thats what lando meant he wouldnt have reacted the way he did after saying it
i think the consensus is that max deserved to be wdc but lewis deserved to win that race max lost loads of points in through no fault of his own and merc had to adopt a very loose interpretation of engine reliability rules to make their car so fast at the end of the year if you give max even half of the points he lost in baku silverstone and hungary he would have been champion with one or two races to spare he drove a close to perfect season and bested one of the greatest ever toto wolff himself boss of lewis hamilton s team said that max deserved the title that year that all being said nobody can be happy with how abu dhabi went down even if i agree that ending that season behind the safety car would have been a travesty it is probably how it should have happened michael masi wanted the race to end with an actual confrontation of the two lead drivers not a parade behind the safety car and not the farce of max battling drivers he was already in front of in the end it was extremely messy and cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been max or lewis triumphant moment edit also this clip is extra funny because lando and max are pretty good friends
yep just take a look at some of the radios after the race https://youtu.be/wmwl8pq0qss https://youtu.be/wk5sbgqcjia
max deserves to be world champion but definitely not like that like man raced like hell the whole year just to end in some bullshit im a lewis fan but it still sucks cause it feels like the drama took the wind out of max s championship
couldn t agree more i don t understand all the hate towards lewis beyond the fact that he dominated for so long max might be the most exceptional raw talent on the grid in years but the stewards decisions in that race unquestionably robbed lewis the poor decisions this year as well have somewhat soured my wanting to watch as well it feels easier to just catch a replay later after all the penalties have settled out and skip hours of red flags and delays
if that s robbery then silverstone is murder
best last lap ever
the entire paddock wanted the race to end under a green flag they had a meeting before hand and every team agreed that a green flag would be waved for the last lap no matter what michael masi did what everyone wanted
found teamlh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77rxpgdr-24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77rxpgdr-24) or watch drive to surive great show that made lot of people come back to f1 with both lewis and max are tied in heading into the last race of the year hamilton held a comfortable lead heading into the 53rd lap of the lap race but a crash by nicholas latifi led to a safety car coming out onto the track due to lapped cars there were five cars between first place hamilton and second place verstappen though all of those cars were behind the two race leaders in overall time race officials initially decided those lapped cars could not overtake the safety car then in a surprising twist officials then told the lapped cars they could pass he safety car putting verstappen directly behind his rival for a one lap dash to the finish but with new fresh tires leaving lewis just stranded there with no chance to combat they went agaisnt their own rules red bull manager christian horner asked f1 race director michael masi over race radio about the situation why aren t we getting these cars out of the way we only need one racing lap soon after that exchange masi made the decision to let the lapped cars pass the safety car mercedes manager toto wolff yelled over the race radio to masi wolff you need to reinstate the lap that s not right masi toto it s called a motor race ok wolff sorry masi we went car racing which made verstappen a first time world champion by going against their own rule just for drama and spectators funny enough happened again this week race with so many not needed red flags fia later dismissed mercedes s protest about verstappen overtaking behind the safety car so fia pretty much gave red bull a championship
it s called a motor race they went car racing

lewis was leading the title decider race by 11sec ahead of verstappen but on the last lap race director decided to forget all racing rules and put them next to each other with verstappen on new tires and rest is history
to add some context regarding the rules in a safety car situation the following proceedings need to be completed before the safety car goes back into the pit lane releasing the cars and letting racw resume any dangers present on the track and any race marshalls on the track need to be cleared all lapped cars which are slower cars that have been overtaken more than once and are more than a lap behind of some cars usually only the first few leading cars are to regain the lap by overtaking the queue behind the safety car completing a full lap and rejoining the end of the queue behind the safety car the safety car needs to complete another full lap before pulling into the pit lane and releasing the queue in abu dhabi only the first step was fully completed and only the lapped cars between the two leading drivers and championship rivals were released weren t given time to join the end of the queue and the safety car immediately pulled into the pit without doing an extra lap all of that to have a single final racing lap instead of finishing the race behind the safety car after this whole mess the race director at the time michael masi which is the guy that basically runs the race and makes sure that the rulebook is followed was sacked and banned from directing races
there is literally chance massa gets his way honestly even though i agree that race should ve been voided
by that precedent couldn t lewis challenge the championship too then but honestly i think it s stupid if you dig deep enough i m sure you could find things that were done wrong that may have changed the outcome in nearly every championship fight
or maybe it was just an honest mistake
really all i see is f1 fans agreeing that what happened at the end of the race season was stupid and wrong and lewis should have been champion while saying max still does deserve the championship i don t know how anyone who is a fan of f1 can say otherwise honestly
not surprised
teamlh having a victim mentality while wishing death upon other people on the grid is my favourite twitter content after every race nice to see lsf has some of it too
or maybe just maybe it s a funny clip involving the most controversial moment in the sport in the past decade and a half
shhhh
teamlh kids and moving on from ad challenge impossible
if it happened to max there would have been riots in the netherlands lol you don t get over a robbery like that
not accepting race fixing and rule breaking to gift a championship cult
massa about to make it
there is no doubt that max is very fast i just wonder how he will drive when his car isnt the clear fastest anymore will he start driving yield or crash again
just looked on wikipedia still says otherwise keep coping hopefully lewis will fight for his 7th next season after singapore gets voided
was this recent
you forget to add lewis hamilton was outclassing every other driver on that day too was leading by a shit tonne
you mean time wdc lewis hamilton 
my favourite thing about verstappen and his fans is that it s never ever his fault there s a just reason for everything he does but only if he does it was a neutral fan who just enjoyed the sport but this incident left such a sour taste about the integrity that i feel there s no point investing my time into watching it anymore maybe i ll become interested again one day but how i still see verstappen and his fans always excuse everything he does just tells me that it ll probably be a while until that time will come
least biased hamilton fan s retelling
lewis hamilton was about to win his 8th world title when the race director masi decided to invent some new rules in order to have a last lap race to decide the championship hamilton would have won under the proper rules so saying hamilton won his 8th is controversial to the people that wanted him to lose and like to pretend that the race director didn t break the rules this leaves out a hell of a lot of context
wouldn t the normal procedure be to let everyone unlap themselves but not wait a bunch of laps to make the decision i felt like the outcome was closer to normal than not or even basically normal for the cars that mattered
this is a biased perspective on the events that took place just posting as a heads up to anyone reading
they literally changed the rules after this debacle to have a shorter safety car procedure under current rules max would still be champion in that situation at the end of the day the fia wants the race to finish under a green flag as much as possible even last race they did their best to end under a green flag edit no rules were changed on the fly from masi s perspective he is obligated to provide safe and clean running to the end he s allowed to use the safety car how he wants and he could choose to not let anyone unlap if the wants to those cars between lewis and max would have had to basically stop somewhere to get out of the way fast enough which is super unsafe for everyone
deleted
after reading these comments it feels so much better that verstappen won the wc in
no drink is as sweet as hamilton fan tears
average hamilton stan opinion lol but i shouldn t be surprised when it s literally a r lewishamilton poster the reality is that the safety car comes in when the track is deemed clear enough for racing optimally all lapped cars will have passed but that wasn t required not to mention hamilton had already cheated and got away with it by cutting the hairpin on lap when verstappen passed him
abu dhabi doe n t urpri e me
under proper rules still crying about it
the race director is the rules
well hamilton still had a chance and lost max clearly was better and deserved the championship
the entire paddock wanted the race to end under a green flag they had a meeting before hand and every team agreed that a green flag would be waved for the last lap no matter what race director did what everyone wanted
back then the mercedes car had an advantage look how hamilton has been doing this and last season after they fixed the rules max is literally just better hamilton fans are salty and you seem to be one of the salty biased ones
in the final race of the season after a hard fought battle between verstappen and hamilton lewis was leading the race comfortably when just a few laps before the finish there had to be a safety car called in before the race the team principals and the race director made a promise to not end the race with a safety car finish so this caused a lot of chaos since team principals at the time had a direct line of communication to the race director they kept shouting at him and caused him to make a very stupid decision of calling the safety car in and not letting all cars unlap as they were supposed to something that because of the very vague wording of the rulebook at the time was actually perfectly legal but clearly wrong so some crybabies who didn t bat an eye when hamilton punted verstappen off the track and only got a second penalty and a free tire change because of the red flag that he caused refuse to accept that max was the deserving winner of the season and claim that lewis actually won the title because they can t accept that sports are sometimes unfair
clip mirror odablock moves to kick https://arazu.io/t3_12e16ll/)** this is an automated comment
guy famous for gambling in a video game moves to kick no surprise there
feel like other streamers have fomo soon he showed he got like 2k dollars from subs in minutes streamers are greedy and they will go for that odablock also gets of his subs gifted on twitch not prime subs so its good for him
everybody thinks oda is sliker lmao
this makes a lot sense from oda s pov because he s got a loyal community already and is now getting contract money a bigger sub cut from kick s pov this makes zero sense oda is a mid sized streamer who plays a super dead game with basically zero growth potential
sliker
i think this is a really good pick up by kick oda averages maybe 6k viewers but his subcount is at least double that or so good indicator of a loyal community that will likely follow him to a new platform his style of streaming is pretty unique for the runescape section as well so not like there s a lot of alternatives in that section on twitch
no doubt a good move for him makes sense
guy is getting a bag and will be back on twitch in a year when kick goes under when all the crypto company s either fail or get caught doing something ridiculously illegal
i only watch his youtube pking vids which are excellent but i am not about to watch someone skill on runescape the real way kick can shut down twitch have an ad free user friendly experience

not to start a big argument under an oda clip of all things but why do you consider that to be greedy if you work somewhere and another company offers you a higher salary and more benefits would you not take that or would you take it and admit that you re greedy as well to me maximizing your worth is not greedy as long as you maintain your morals in the process i don t care for kick at all but twitch has only implemented policy changes that negatively impact their employees see the split if anything amazon is the greedy one in this situation there is obviously a huge controversy around the company but you don t necessarily have to be part of that as a kick streamer like you said kick has been more than generous in paying out their streamers and that is a beautiful thing
that s the osrs directory in general if you scroll through the viewer streamers maybe even less they all have way more subs than they have viewers kick is the smart move for most of them if they can get their community migrated over there odablock going is a good first step
oda is a gambler kick is a gambling website people willing to watch a guy gamble in runescape is much more likely to gamble in real life
i think it actually makes a lot of sense from kick s pov one of the mistakes mixer made was that they just pulled random big names in the of big streamers while completely ignoring the to that is either there to act as support or to stream in different time slots in order to leech off of them mixer was missing mid sized streamers the platform only had to offer new small time streamers or the ones at the very top but nothing in between
oda has a funny personality haven t watched him in awhile but he definitely does have room for growth especially if he plays other games like valorant or gta etc
kick s perspective is getting as many people looking at their site as possible imo especially in the early stages
his react content is still better than mizkif xqc
super dead osrs is a grindfest and boring sure but as a category it does decently im confused how its super dead
it is but he s not gambling there you could argue the ethics of moving to the site hosted by gamblers though but that s up to him
yeah they do oda s got 13k subs or so rn like rank overall on twitch
maybe that s the motive although odablock doesn t really gamble anymore well not very often he s doing a hcim series now you could debate that death matching on the game is gambling though
okay
damn it s such a boring game good for him
are muslims allowed to gamble with irl money
if mizkif xqc can grow doing react content so he can too he s already funnier than them
nope gambling except for very few exceptions is forbidden if oda is a practising muslim i don t know much about him then he might have missed the memo lol

the camera movement is probably achieved with a ptz https://youtu.be/4c6hhrepxxi) camera which is special kind of camera that allows an operator to remotely pan tilt and zoom obs scene switching is probably done by temporarily allowing remote acess to squeex s streaming pc which is hooked up to the ptz cameras this can be done natively on windows or with the use of stuff like team viewer
thanks makes sense to do something as simple as remote access team viewer for whatever reason i was overthinking it and picturing something more complicated like a obs plugin 3rd party software that connects to obs itself

not really clip worthy is it

thanks a lot you
we aren t all watching quin
for seconds i was happy watching it so yes it is worth clipping because time you enjoy wasting is not time wasted
very interesting you clearly have no idea gpt can process tokens there are two versions of gpt one can process 8k tokens the other can process 32k chatgpt uses a model in this case nymn has chosen gpt
that is incorrect anyone who has used gpt like myself would know that how about you spend bucks to test it yourself instead of spitting bullshit on the internet chatgpt gpt we are testing gpt it s not a chatgpt just a different and more advanced ai language model
you re the one spitting bullshit on the internet claiming first that this isn t chatgpt but gpt which it clearly isn t then you claim that since gpt can t remember past 8k tokens it s less powerful than the previous gpt model which it clearly isn t now you re telling me to spend mo to test out something i m already using and i m telling you that nymn is using chatgpt with the gpt model which means it s quite literally able to talk to you and remember way more than the free version of chatgpt which uses the default gpt model if you re already paying for chatgpt i suggest you cancel that sub because you clearly don t know what you re paying for and then start to look into what all this gpt stuff means

twitch wants a cut from everything eh
isn t this bounties with a few extra steps
this looks like they wanna put their hand in a different cookie jar after taking the sub money
honestly the only thing twitch seems to dev these days is ways to extract further cash i don t think they ve had a decent tech change in years i don t know how a company with the backing of aws some of the brightest minds still has a player from justin tv
sub cut is not enough they want more more
streamers union when
we re testing new ways to get a cut of sponsored streams
sounds good for smaller streamers that have trouble getting sponsors or the ones that have really bad deals with their talent agencies people here talking about twitch wanting a cut don t realize most streamers are already giving a sum of their sponsor money to a talent agencies that deal with getting the sponsor i doubt their rates would compare to with the deals bigger streamers have but i wouldn t be surprised if twitch had better rates than the ones talent agencies give to small streamers
kick danger kicked in yo
wonder if this will lead to twitch disallowing independently sponsored streams and forcing everything to go through their service so they get a cut if they don t do something like that every streamer is going to realize instantly that finding their own deals is going to be worth a lot more and just do that instead maybe people would make some connections through the service and only then stop using it but that isn t much better for twitch
this is probably good for streamers twitch and brands not so good for the viewers who will just end up getting peddled even more products this looks like twitch just took a page out of cashapp s marketing strategy about a year ago and built it into the platform itself
more money for the company thats all
it can t be worse than streamelements sponsorships right
you guys are getting ads lmao
you know what ll make twitch better more ads twitch execs probably
sponsored subs sounds like a terrible idea
this is a really good example of how corporation s destroy everything any new avenue the people find to make money eventually a corporation will come in and take over it because they have the funds to do it this won t work for twitch yet we will fight it the second we stop fighting it takes over guess we didn t care about enough hope you care about this
sounds like a fantastic way to cut down on those fansly sponsorships that are suddenly the most offensive thing to ever exist
will this mean less ads for people watching if not why not
the gifted subs from sponsors is actually good been wondering why that s not a thing since burger king randomly did that now and again
insane that the hivemind in here is so anti kick when twitch continues to do this shit
this is a great thing for streamers that aren t a part of orgs or other things especially if twitch focuses on those streamers it is harder to get a sponsor without being part of an org or a large talent agency and twitch connecting them should get streamers sponsors faster
b cels coping cuz the a chads have finally congregated
or maybe don t take a cut so people don t have to take sponsorships you fucking moron company
they still get their good part of that for the split they should put the subs back and leave the prime which are the ones that cost twitch money at least
this is literally what they did with bits to try to replace donations so they could get a cut but now with sponsorships
huge w for streamers with no agents glad for this
nobody liked this
i aint reading all dat
i didn t realise how bad the bounties were until both ludwig and train independently talked about it apparently the meta is look at what is being offered as a bounty and then contact independently to the company to get a better rate than the reduced cut the bounty system via twitch gives
if they want a cut they should offer to include things in the sponsorship that sponsors normally can t for example days of no ads for anyone copyrighted music without dmca strikes or muted vods 4k streams with higher bandwidth than 1080p automatic raids from other participants when they end stream automatic matching of gifted subs and discounts etc like they already mentioned front page for hours targeted gifted subs like you would target ads things that improve your stream or it s reach could be worth it for the streamer despite getting a lower cut of the money than normal
twitch isnt a charity
twitch also wants multiple ways to get marketing money onto the platform for the streamer seems like they are also just shitting out their meeting notes to push streamers away from kick
quite a few extra steps
but what about second bounties
the new ceo is all about monetization over everything else he doesn t give a shit about the community and everyone who meets him says he s very out of touch
i watch a lot of viewer streamers and they have a hard time getting any sponsors at all and they don t have access to bounties so this would probably be good for them but this is a way for twitch to sneak into getting the sponsors for themselves
they need tech change but it s hard to ask amazon for more money when you aren t turning a profit anyway
i think 7tv has made more accessibility and visual updates to twitch than twitch lately
and who is going to pay for that massive tech upgrade when they re not making a profit
guest star ain t bad but it needs more work imo
amazon does not have some of the brightest minds their work culture doesn t allow for innovation and creative minds even in their highest positions the attrition rate is insanely high quoting an article from the lowest attrition rate for one of the company s tiers of employees was almost percent with the highest reaching a staggering percent btw a high attrition rate is anything over amazon is completely nuts
at least this one is extracting it from the streamer this time instead of the viewer
it s literally unusable without bttv
these days
kick is only gonna look better and better the more twitch does this but then again i wonder how kick pays for its servers
never that s why doc got banned
streamers would never unionize because it makes fucking sense streamers are not coworkers they are people competing with eachother a streamers union if truly a union would include all streamers not just the massive ones and a union would be fighting for decent pay for all their members which means top streamers would make less and small streamers would make more now obviously that s not what these big streamers want a streamers union in these guys world would look more like an athletic association for pro athletes they would represent the biggest streamers and the big ones only no little guys they would help the biggest streamers secure better contracts etc etc it s not a union if the only people benefiting are the very top streamers
twitch doesn t make enough profit for a streamer union to make sense on top of that live streamers are some of the most degenerate egotistical content creators around if this is how they act now i would hate to see how they act if they are the ones calling the shots
hasan tried years ago and iirc no one but like big streamers gave a shit and so he stopped trying no way a streamer union works now cause after stuff like mixer failed twitch believes they won the streaming war so they don t have to bargain
streamers union would have no power because streamers are narcissists by nature imagine a streamer strike there would be lineups out the door of scabs seeing this as their big chance to claim all the viewers
i disagree it s a bad deal both ways not only are small streamers gonna more than likely get jipped from what they re actually worth from these companies but now they re still gonna get that twitch is gonna pocket cash from them too most companies would pay a ton even if you re getting concurrent viewers you could argue that s still above but to a lot of people they consider that a small streamer
you can just look at other features like bits or gifted subs it was a way to get a cut of tips but they never banned third party tipping services they re used because it s native to the platform and tie in to alerts hype train in chat they re doing the same thing there twitch is implementing native player skins and banners on the channel page sponsored gifted subs and sub discounts if the ctr and engagement are better this way sponsors will go through this
if twitch did that i think it d be suicide for the platform not even youtube does that not to mention i think they could get a court case for ethics around that
twitch would never do that it would completely destroy the platform for small streamers all streamers make the most money on sponsors
every streamer is going to realize instantly that finding their own deals is going to be worth a lot more and just do that instead obviously if you re doing all the work to get the sponsor you should get all the money but vast majority of streamers already give cut to org agent that got them that sponsor so twitch getting a cut from sponsors they give to streamers is normal
how i see it working is they are going to do this thing people will know that getting their own deal is a better value but will still use it years will pass twitch will ban independent sponsors people will be pissed for months and forget about it few years will go back as twitch slowly lowers the amount content creators make from sponsors
lmao
well yeah that is how normal things work you doing the work to find a sponsor means you get the best value but somebody else just giving you the money and sponsor info gets a cut what is crazy about that
i remember charlie talking about it as well he basically said it wasn t worth taking and it would be smarter for the streamer to reach out to the company individually to get a better deal
bounties are bad for the 10k viewer andy but for under 5k viewer andy bounties can be really good
that doesn t sound any different than signing with an org with a portfolio of sponsors which people still choose to do over time twitch should have a large amount of huge sponsors and it s just an easy way to get money for content creators
i m surprised this is even allowed twitch could just ban all other donation and sponsors other than what they deliver through their system i mean what s stopping 3rd party just making everything they offer and just cutting the twitch off completely unlockable sub emotes through bttv etc donations through 3rd party apps etc then twitch just loses money by offering the platform i know this would cause uproar and prob will not happen but it is possible and profitable for them
depending on the cut it makes sense since twitch is providing the service of seeking out advertising opportunities for the streamers if they want to contact those companies outside of that system i don t get the issue
4k won t happen anytime soon even yt is trying to limit 4k bandwidth is just so expensive
magical wishlist at this point lol
creative ideas nice to see
or there is another very real possibility he maybe the only one who actually is in touch with the real important information with the recent job cuts also impacting twitch it proves that the amazon overlords are paying attention to profitability across all their companies for all we know he has been given simple directive make this money sink profitable or we will shut it down if that is the case pretty much all his moves make a lot more sense
news flash companies want to make as much possible more at
they don t have access to bounties you think they will have access to this its same as bounties but worse for streamers
i really want to know where this narrative of twitch not turning a profit came from as it s said with such a mater of fact tone all the time certainly it s not just sourced by guesses right no one actually has any idea how much net revenue twitch has only estimations and as everyone should knows financial estimations can be and frequently are wildly disconnected from reality amazon doesn t publish twitch financial data
amazon not turning profit daily dose of info out of my asshole
large companies not turning a profit does not mean they are in financial ruins or crisis it means they are using the profits they do make within the financial taxed year to reinvest into expansion hirings data centers etc if they stopped expanding today they would turn a profit tomorrow but if they do that then they cant write it off on taxes either example if you open a lemonade stand and sell lemonade for per drink you cost to open the stand was you sell lemonade drinks today leaving you with minus the cost of the lemons lets say total you now have profit instead of putting that into your pocket you now buy of lemons to make even more lemonade drinks the next day then after a few weeks of that you open a 2nd lemonade stand then after months of lemonade stands you open a chocolate strawberry stand using all the money you made from the lemonade stands your strawbery stand is what you are going to use to fund your vacations while you keep using your lemonade stands to expand or buy more lemons thus not turning a profit make sense never ever ever ever ever ever feel bad for any large or smart company that tells you they are not turning a profit lets not even get into how these companies leverage debt in the billions that will never be paid off in you or my life time combined
their last update definitely fucked all that up though never uninstalled an extension faster in my life
why do you guys act like the value of a company or asset solely derives off its current profitability scaling can matter way more if it s cashed out in smart ways if amazon could figure it out they wouldn t need to milk alienate their own streamers
it s an investment my dude amazon currently resells the core component of twitch through amazon ivs their profitability is directly linked to how well ivs is doing and since kick is also using it i d wager twitch is actually making a decent bit of cash now
assuming that stat includes and is mainly driven by the amazon storefront workerforce which is completely unrelated
kick will run at a loss indefinitely i wonder what twitch needs the cash for their parent company literally owns the servers
this is a hot take that i like
wait whaaaaaaat
interesting is this tinfoil hattery or something you have some level of verifiable info on i won t ask for sources but do you have a take with more detail an amusing anectdote you can dress upmaybe hell a jaunty limerick would be fine as well i m genuinely curious
i guess it could be something like the writers guild of america or screen actor guild but you re right that the logistics of such a thing are wild
there s no way a streamers union would work because the vast majority of streamers are nonames an organization that only represents the top streamers is not a union that makes no sense it s more like a players association that you see act sort of like a union for professional athletes rather then a normal union regardless the top streamers forming a group and then calling it a union does not mean in any functional way shape or form that it is actually a union
also scab streamers will just come in and capture all the viewers if the union ever did strike
the problem for small streamer is its hard to get a foot in the door with a company when everyone bigger than you is also looking for sponsors yes it will be less money but its more than you were originally getting
this won t mean twitch can pocket money from sponsors streamers are currently doing they would just create new sponsors opportunies and replace the job of the talent agencies i agree that it s likely the deals wouldn t be that good and streamers wouldn t get paid what they re worth like streamers with good deals are however twitch creating new sponsor opportunies wouldn t be a negative unless they managed to replace all talent agencies and create some kind of monopoly streamers could just choose to not do them and stay with their talent agencies if they found their current deals to be better
jipped that s a yikes from me
i swear all the top multi millionaire streamers have convinced their audience that they re getting financially screwed over as they rake in literal millions years ago streamers were ecstatic to make low figures and now they act like they re being oppressed for only making a few million instead of more it s hilarious seeing all the top streamers bitch about how twitch is no longer giving them the multi million dollar exclusivity contracts that they were given from due to mixer like oh no dude you re only going to make figures instead of figures now
while that s true it doesn t sound like twitch was taking a fair cut agents typically take for procuring sponsors according to them twitch was taking the majority of the money
thank you for this comment some sense but yes thats the thing twitch viewers swear they are astute business people but they have no fucking idea how any of the business works the top of twitch are essentially getting a nba draft lottery pick type bag they probably only pay a manager some a pr firm if that and thats it i just saw someone say amazon is being greedy because if the split
im confused you just repeated exactly what the other guy said
i might have mistaken lud for charlie or lud was watching charlie talk about it first perhaps
ngl that sounds like a quick way to get permabanned from twitch
yeah makes sense easier for them to go through twitch then to reach out to specific brands to make deals themselves if the streamers aren t as noticeable
bounties are also bad because game bounties tank your average viewership also if a streamer does a big event then try to do a bounty they need massive viewership qt probably needs like 100k viewers right now to get max payout because of the award show
in this case it would be payed for by the sponsor and only for that specific stream streamer so not the same thing as adding it sitewide for everyone
not all companies do it the same way though
i don t know and neither do you
it s sourced from twitch when they discuss ad deals because according to some twitch would have absolutely no reason to twist the truth when pushing ad deals
clip mirror moistcritikal is confused by xqc bringing up gambling during fansly debate https://arazu.io/t3_12baqkp/)** this is an automated comment
all roads leads to gamba
it s like he was messaging train during this debate
gif giphy 2wxwfiavndgcm xqc has got to be one of the worst fucking debaters ever like i ve never had someone be so stupid while debating that i just had to mute them
it s almost as if his gamba addiction is his ulterior motive for everything he does
he should just go to kick at this point
i don t understand why he goes into debates if at the end of the day when he loses the argument he acts so oblivious says well i m schizo i m stupid i don t know much about this topic don t listen to me i m uninformed it s content these are the exact words he used when the high schooler from his chat cooked him on the guns debate i didn t even mention the personal insults he was throwing at the guy when he felt cornered and couldn t even give an answer back he acts like he cares so much about a subject then proceeds to laugh it off when he is proved wrong
xqc has gotten so fucking bitter overtime its insane actually painfull to listen to him nowadays
deleted
it does sound like x is trying to prime his audience for his eventual gamba streams on kick feigning outrage at fansly and talking about how good in comparison gamba is
xqc try not to self victimize challenge impossible
xqc has always been toxic but now he s just so bitter and annoying boring as fuck
i am going to make a controversial take fansly is not as bad as gambling like not even remotely
lil bro should stick to the block game
he s so defensive of gambling it s insane anyone mentions gamba and he s fighting for his fuckin life every time that s literally the entire reason for the miz and maya drama last year him and train just said no you cuz miz said gamba bad jokes one too many times
xqc and his chat confuses confidence with competence he is literally stuck at the peak of mount stupid referring to the dunning kruger effect
well im schizo and some juicers have the spine to say hes intelligent i undestand if somebody find him entertaining but god dam you cant say hes intelligent
over under on how long it ll take before he s ranting about hasan
just a few points off the top of my head x s own show was sponsored by fansly x used to gamble to an audience of children all the time iirc it was his viewers who signed up for stake showing how they don t check ages at all to sign up i know for sure that he s seen the threat that was on here where it was shown x continues to look at booba tiktoks which is spicyer than most of what s on fansly the streamer awards fansly sponsor sent you to the page of the awards themselves for backstage interviews where you go from there is up to you
whats the point of a fansly debate if he clicks on sexual tiktok links everyday anyways he s promoting coomer shit for free
xqc is exactly the type of person i can see in a where are they now story about how he quit streaming and went bankrupt crypto gambling
i remember when xqc was laughing at hours intro that train did he turned into he said he would never watch tik tok and now he does says he would play variety and single player games always all he does is cope in minecraft and have the dumbest takes of all mankind that nobody asked he s just want to gamble and this is legit even more dogshit content than asmr bath streams or just sleeping category the man grinded games before had real fun single player games sometimes donos were hilarious and chat was not filled with dogshits zoomer emotes i want ow and raging fn xqc back feelsbadman now all we got his videos dumb drama and schizo takes when he talk about a subject that nobody asked sadge
i m going to be honest i don t think anyone cares about any of this but nobody likes being called a hypocrite so everyone feels the need to defend themselves
as a juicer it s very painful to hear x debate on any kind of topic
i can t tell who is stupider xqc or his fans
honestly gambling should be banned across every platform because it s not entertaining to watch at all
the whole lead up to the gambling streams up until it was banned really flipped my perception of xqc lots of lying to the chat lied at first about it being a sponsor defended gambling compares it to alcohol etc
how long until he hops on kick
i m going to just say xqc would have a lot better time with things like these if he had a healthy sleep schedule any mental dexterity he had went away with the hour sleep cycle
marketers at stake must be frothing at the mouth with the situation they re in not only did they convince streamers to throw away any semblance of morals to advertise gambling to children but some of these streamers are actually braindead enough to initially be entertained by and eventually addicted to bright colorful lights and big numbers if you want to get an idea of the level of cognition that a gambling addict like xqc operates at just go look at a few videos on youtube kids and compare it to the slot machines that xqc or train will spend hours at a time on
its so weird this dude has tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars eats toenails for dinner and is still butthurt he cant pedal gambling to his child audience
schizo
is train ghost writing the debate for xqc i always comes down to gambling with those two christ
xqc sounds like the pig at the end of the bugs bunny cartoon
i used to be a huge fan of his but everything started going downhill since the among us days that era showed that his toxicity sometimes crosses competitiveness then it was gta rp which showed this toxicity to a higher degree then it was gambling and his takes on it pure brain rot negative accountability whataboutism he s such a bitter person now used to be a fun community
if i hear the word disingenuous one more time
lol he wants to gamble so damn bad
none of the crusading xqc train and his chatters do will ever be in good faith or with the intent to spread a greater message all of this shit is stemming from the whole deal with streamers speaking out against gambling on twitch and x and his friend group are never gonna let that go any chance they get they will try and involve the people that talked against their favorite hobby into this drama shit
what exactly is xqc s appeal weaponized stupidity
mans just needs to just react to tiktoks and keep it at that
follow along as we take a deep dive into the xqcconspiracy rabbit hole the wall felix what does it mean the drawings the lines the words ufos in the sky it all leads to gamba
people in chat were saying it was stake that took the kids money is that true
hes legit been schizo this stream
the gambling streams has done irreversible damage to the quality of xqc streams even a year later and he s still devastated over the criticism he got over gambling other comments saying he s bitter is spot on if he moves to kick just to gamble it will be the biggest middle finger to the community he grew on twitch all just to fucking gamble
charlie is just on another level while debating i d like to see him versus somebody with actual talent like hasan that would be a prime stream
every time x starts the have personal issues he goes crazy on gamba gets mad at everything and everyone and starts to burn bridges how are people not tired of this it s just so immature
lil bro think he s genius
for the culture i went and signed up to fansly using my twitch account and clicked buttons until i saw nudity it was five clicks re entering my twitch login info and typing in a code from my phone to verify and you know what fansly does a poor job at preventing minors from accessing the platform but typing in boobs on google com required less verification less steps and less clicks let s be real any teenager who wants to find nudity on the internet is going to find it i did it years ago when i was shit ain t rocket surgery if you want to compare amouranth showing her butt on stream to trainwreck gambling on stream as a porn versus gambling addiction then
oh i m schizo i m like wtf lulw
does anyone else notice how he more and more starts to talk like train does
xqc really needs to stop talking to train
thank god i m a vod andy
i ll never open another debate clip if it means i won t have to hear the word disingenuous again
is he hooked to train at the hip or something
lmaooooooooo
at least he s aware of schizo activity
i was so confused when i signed up to stake and they didn t ask for my id like you could just buy crypto on a site that doesn t verify age and gamble if you re under no problem like what the fuck
why does he keep going back to gambling he also says gambling is the responsibility of the person who pulls the trigger he s literally mentally ill when he speaks about gamba his iq legit drops points whenever it is brought up functional thought falls to shambles
xqc really struggling to organize and deliver thoughts in a rational manner it s kind of alarming how he doesn t know when to talk in that video game call out trash talk pace vs a normal human speaking pace
adults aren t allowed to use the internet because there are no safeguards you can create that children can t bypass all of these please think of the children arguments are just trash
i agree gambling in itself was not very relevant to the topic but some commenters are kind of spinning his point xqc was making a bigger point about safeguards on content and was trying to say no matter how strict the safeguard people will always criticize them for not being strict enough and he brought up crypto gambling as having a big barrier for entry since it involves many steps such as interacting with crypto exchanges etc which does verify your age cr1tikal got lost because he wasn t making an argument about safeguards he basically brought it up in passing as he at least initially thought that fansly had stricter safeguards than a site like kick so if anything xqc really got hung up on the topic of safeguards not gambling as most commenters are suggesting

i remember when lsf was for fails now its just drama farmers
because its the fucking same the argument was its shitty promoting something dangerous and addictive to kids porn and gambling are both those things
correct me if i m wrong because i didn t watch the whole thing i think what xqc trying to say was that twitch deemed gambling bad and wanna safeguard the younger audience by banning gambling and the promotion of gambling on twitch at the same time porn is not allowed on twitch yet they still allow basically porn via the hot tub section and if promoting gambling is not allowed then why promoting fansly which is equivalent to porn in xqc s point of view is allowed don t get me wrong i m not defending gambling i think it is a very damaging addiction still this does bring interesting point of how things kinda get picked and chosen and may seem inconsistent to some especially xqc and train
okay but be real these streamers clearly cater their channel and streams to a pg audience so taking sponsors from effectively a porn site is weird no matter how you slice it imagine going to see the cinema and watching the matrix or the latest mcu film and you get a porn site ad plastered on it the difference between showing porn on stream and pushing fansly streams is like handing a kid a cigarette vs pushing him towards a dealer
gif giphy dqepzjgmjywg4lkrlj downsized
guns should also be legal because the engineering and appearance is cool
i was watching this live and what he was talking about before the call actually made some sense he was cooking and then as soon as charlie joined he just folded and wasn t speaking clearly or conveying his points clearly moistyboy on the other hand had an argument and a logical train of thought and reasoning he believed in and controlled the debate he communicated his point clearly double downed on his statements and clarifications and reinforced his point what xqc was saying whilst watching critikals video before the call was actually pretty valid and charlie s argument did have a major flaw but x never even capitalised on it and even if x did charlie would have just made another example point that x wouldn t be able to process and refute charlie would just make a good argument and x would inevitably end up agreeing with the point and he would come to some mutual agree to disagree situation inside his head even though it s clear that charlie s argument is superior and was proven to be stronger then whatever x tried cooking up i reckon charlie was aware of the massive flaw in his argument that x thought he caught him out on and used i wasn t aware of that information when i said that or i am now aware that it s like type statements to weaken xs points since he could just dismiss the criticism with not having all the information at the time and x folded
deleted
it shouldn t be confusing to bring up gambling because they share very similar issues being addiction and keeping minors and developing brains of minors away from these things anyone who goes hard against gambling is inconsistent if they don t understand that the psychology of porn is very similar i personally love all of it but there is a world of difference between being ok with something and being ok with something for kids to see too and maybe part of this is a failure of society by not having a transition period in a kids life to adulthood you have legally around and then and bam all these things are supposed to be thrown at you something about that doesn t seem right
who the hell are these people
charlie v destiny incoming
removed
this weirdly has transfered all criticism to xqc instead of moist for not calling out qt when she advertised porn to children
tbh both are wrongs at the end of the day only one is take seriously has a problem the other lets be real people streamers don t really care about
i mean i see his point he s trying to say that charlie promoting content on a non porn site is actually wrong and charlie is saying and debating that showing actual porn and advertising porn sites are two different things
did people even watch the clip here
fa babyyyyy
this guy
gamba hasan conspiracy that everyone is out to get train and himself
fuck my juicer is regarded
end of the day it s all business for both charlie and xqc dosent matter bad publicity or good lol they know what they doing by farming lsf and people who care about too much and turn algorithm up by comments here or on yt and nd cash flow keeps coming half the people here who comments probably donated to one of those millionaire and also crying about them lmao just don t donate get content and move on
at some point train and xqc need to just admit that all of the drama all of their hate towards other streamers and all of the nukes they have tried to drop is all related to the streamers forcing twitch to ban gambling it just is they will never get over it and it will always pollute every conversation they try to have and pretend like they have some moral high ground in
and arguing with hasan largely incoherent nonsense tho
debating someone about gambling message train debating hasan about something message train destiny proceed to still lose the 2v1 or 3v1
as a juicer it pains me to say that he has good morals overall but will defend gambling like his life depends on it it s definitely an ego thing since he was personally attacked for it but damn he just needs to let it go and accept it
both are prone to feeling intelligent when they have their monologues with chat where they can single out a comment that s even stupider than what they re saying but when they have to have actual conversations with people who don t go along with whatever point they re making they freeze up and keep going back to a handful of canned responses reminds me of marco rubio in the republican primary debates in out to get me because of gamba is xqc s version of we need to dispel this fiction that barrack obama doesn t know what he s doing he knows exactly what he s doing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqshyg4qvt4
yea it bothers me that he thinks he s smart or is making good points he s quite stupid and misinformed on all topics outside of streaming and esports
hes an egotistical uneducated goblin i dont understand why people even bother dealing with him
since when they integrated gifs in this subreddit first time i have seen it here
idk why people like him train sneako and adin do these debate like streams they re all clueless
he s legitimately not mentally equipped enough to have a thorough and deep debate conversation about anything i don t know if it s the streamer bubble he lives in or if he s been like this his whole life but he is generally speaking a very stupid and misinformed person all of that in itself sucks and is unfortunate but isn t uncommon in the real word the problem is with his platform it gives him tons of confidence and reinforces his shit beliefs and views after all if s of thousands of people watch him he must be right and smart right it s not like he s never had a good thought opinion but even on things where maybe he is actually right on he can t keep focused and articulate his points in any kind of real conversation that said while he might be an idiot overall i don t think he s a bad person it s not an asmon type of situation imo where not only is he an idiot but a legitimately terrible human being
he knows the word disingenuous though so that means he s a pretty good debater actually
i agree with you this gif shit tho is cringe and reminds me of something like 9gag
largest streamer on the platform that primarily sits in his bubble hours a day of course he s going to think he s highly intelligent and not just lucky
with the way the dude talks how can anyone think debates are for him i ve never understood why he s so popular
people shit on jontron but at least hes done like debate and was like ok i suck at this back to making videos while i keep seeing xqc trying to debate and continue to debate and continue to fail
xqc only has good takes when the topic doesn t involve him
i think he needs more destiny debate training cause this ain t it

learned my lesson on csgolounge in my youth and never went back
everyone thinks they are special and the exception until they get got hope the guy turns his life around
i m just glad for me i was able to get it under control before it got out of hand i was spending close to 1k a month which may not seem like a lot to streamers but for an average guy it is
if only this guy saw the dont gamble image train has on his stream im sure he wouldnt of made those mistakes s
bruh me losing only was what made think gambling was shit lol
the only way content creators make money from gambling streams is if it creates addiction and ruins lives otherwise the deals wouldn t be that big
i genuinely feel bad for gambling addicts if you aren t conscious about the psychological manipulation casinos both online and in person employ in order to rope people in and keep them there it s frighteningly easy to lose yourself and before you know it you re in deep if my friends wanted me to go out with them to a casino i d go but my cards are staying home and any cash i bring is money that i m accepting is being spent not gambled
the dude in the rain forest is a moron he s mentioning ethan h3 as the guy in the rain forest when ethan had this background during the debate with hasan xqc and trainwreckstv in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asdzp6bwkg0. aware
i lost a lot of money from it was to the point where i was overdrafting my checking account and couldn t afford anything luckily got it under control before i got into debt but it still made life hell for about a year can t imagine how bad it is for those who go even further i got into gambling from watching it on twitch slots streams do push viewers to gamble and foster new addictions slots streamers don t take that very seriously
at least hasan is consistent don t gamble on these sites especially the unregulated ones im sure he goes to vegas and gambles on his own time but it s off stream who cares his community is also mid to late s politic frogs people like train or xqc can gamble with a footnote do not gamble you will not win because they re already millionaires or being paid to gamble they re so far removed from reality that even losing everything they re still public figures who will end up having their debts paid off by fans or sponsors literally too big to fail
good job train also adin s friend cheesur now has a severe gambling problem as well and just lost tons of money down really bad people that support kick are contributing to this because kick was made mainly for the sole purpose of promoting stake
i understand you probably won t read this proceeds to send the exact same message three times
that was actually a good saying at the end
this was every gamer defending lootboxes when they were first introduced now most everyone is against them not saying battlepasses are better gambling is shit stay away from it
according to what i keep hearing people say about hasan he would laugh at this person then spit in his face before committing a cancel culture on his entire family what s going on here could it be that hasan is genuinely a decent person and there s a reason why all my favorite streamers love him
i wonder how many suicides xqc train etc have caused already due to gambling statistically the chance of being at least is very high
honestly huge respect for him for admitting to his faults that takes some serious balls
shout out for chat being so supportive and not piling on them
been reading so many braindead comments for too long it isn t black and white there are laws and unspoken guidelines companies follow for advertising on tv i think twitch should do the same with their tos i think twitch needs to be more clear when a stream is just because gambling is the topic doesn t mean everyone s ok with streamers promoting other vices getting into a virtual offshore crypto casino is infinitely easier for someone underage than forging a physical fake id to buy alcohol alcohol commercials don t show actual consumption and cigarette ads are banned prescription drug commercials must list side effects and tell you to consult a doctor ads for illegal drugs don t exist so why bring it up twitch should follow these same guidelines as tv for streamers and their sponsors and extend that to gambling no actual gambling on stream if you re sponsored tl dr if a widely addictive vice is being used on stream it shouldn t be sponsored if the stream in not sponsored everything legal is fair game as long as the stream is probably gonna cv paste this in the next inevitable shitstorm involving train hasan and or xqc
train this is about me again
no matter where you turn away from a loss it s profit interesting saying
book book book
gambling can destroy people so quickly hopefully he can recover but sometimes it can just get a hold of people and they can t escape
i know how i can be with food so i don t even try gambling the same is true for smoking drinking and well drugs drinking i can handle because i seldom drink
he got it twisted
people don t take it seriously when we say gambling is not something that should be pushed as much as it is or when we point out how dangerous it is but that s the reality of it it is extremely easy to fall into a gambling addiction hell the industry literally banks on it it s designed entirely to pull you in deeper and deeper with the hopes of success and that design is exceedingly effective this shit ruins lives
dude shoulda sold his house and put it on so close to hitting big
guy who is a victim of xqc and train peddling gamba
the house always wins
if someone plays a game that has a negative expected value for long enough it is certain that they will lose all their money this is guaranteed as per the statistical truism of gambler s ruin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gambler%27s_ruin).
this is what xqc had no problem promoting to young kids btw
i dabble a bit especially on sports i don t get crazy with it in terms of money mainly on huge parlays for a low amounts it makes the weekend fun i even hit one and made 1k putting in a 10ner since it s a relatively small amount i don t particularly feel bad i don t know if i m risking it i don t have addictive personality when it comes to things like this i wonder if i should put a full stop
reminds me of the heroin reddit dude feelsbadman he tried the drug then ended up getting hooked thankfully he knocked the habit
you can t be good at gambling it s a common misconception you can be addicted which is also common
seeing sports gambling or gambling in general everywhere is concerning
gamblers be like it will never happen to me im just built different
i learned my shit in runescape in many different ways
but train put a don t gamble sign on his stream no way this isn t possible
glad to see im not the only one who figured it out on csgo gambling websites as a minor lmao
average trainwrecks viewer
of gamblers quit before they make it big
lost to csgo cases never again lmao
i know for a fact i have a serious addictive personality about 8yrs ago i got myself voluntarily blacklisted from casino s both online and irl never regretted that step for a second gambling is poison and it gets you before you know it

imagine being a guy who starts gambling and hits a nice win on your first try i imagine these sites probably increase your odds of winning by a slight amount from when you first start gambling it would seem logical to do so in terms of making money off you
i thought they banned gambling on twitch so why do i see a slots category
gamblers deserve to lose
gambling is for losers you can gamble if you want but you re a loser
what a fucking idiot
commence the circlejerk
lol this comment reeks of being fake
he should probably start with cancelling his amazon prime membership and the hasan sub unless gifted gl tho
have some agency lmao
lol he should know better to not gamble
totally real story
gambling is for losers you can gamble if you want but you re a loser
stopped before getting the bag smh
this sounds so fake and pathetic clout chasing
nahh lil bro faking chat messages months in advance for a lsf clip
false flag
this argument that twitch enables people to become gambling is so cringe all i see is people losing money when i watched gambling not to mention the amount of time they say don t gamble this is natural selection at this point your a dumbass if you watch train or x gamble and then decide to gamble i honestly think the irony in this whole thing is that gambling streams make me not want to gamble if you dont see this then you were gonna get fucked by addiction one way or another
def not staged
why are we taking the word of some random chatter lol like did he provide proof its legit or is it just someone else seeking attention
natural selection at work gamblers deserve the worst
not a paid actor btw
i m sure glad that gambling is no longer on twitch am i right
at least hasan wasn t being his usual asshole self and was nice to him
ostonox alt account nice try
fuck him lmao no sympathy
holy shit we are still on this dramatic shit jesus twitch blows now go back to dumber drama
keeeeeeeek hahaha sit rat
you gotta know when to get out early it plays on the greed this dude said he cashed out thousands he could have walked away right then but didn t even train says to back out early after winning because it s all downhill from there
this is why most states have crazy strict laws when it comes to gambling shit even las vegas requires casinos to ban you after you lose to much train and this whole why bad shit ignores decades of research on how bad gambling can be wasn t just a tax thing rather a people kill themselves or others over debt caused by gambling it s not a joke and people on the internet made it out to be a you problem and not a us problem you really think the reason you can t gamble on a street corner has something to do with taxes yeah that plays a part just like wasting resources to clean your body off the street because you didn t wear a seat belt
my buddy was heavy into the csgo gambling scene when it was big and at his peak was up before losing everything and more dude won t even go to any casinos now learned his lesson
sometimes i look back on the peak of csgolounge and skinbetting during like and think to myself how fun it was to win and follow the esports scene then i remember how i wasted hundreds continually buying skins and proceeding to lose them on matches man if i kept even a small amount of the awp asiimovs or kato cologne stickers you d get from winnings i d be thousands richer today
csgolounge is the only time i ve ever had ev bets if you understood how the skin draft worked with max bets having the chance to be ev bets and could afford to hedge those bets the risk was relatively small i ll never have the opportunity like that again because if casinos worked like lounge did they would be out of business
deleted
yep same for me once turned into on coin flips and then went straight back to it s not even about the loss of the it s the fact that quitting while you re ahead is just so hard to do inevitably you just lose it all i consider myself lucky learning that lesson for
i had so much fun on csgo lounge then i lost a lot of skins on ibuypower vs netcodeguides literally screaming at the screen as they refused to hand the awp to their awper and faced their cameras into walls it was my last time betting because i knew that shit was rigged the day it was played blew my mind i got scammed on that and it took them months to get those cheats
ehh lost a couple of cases i m sure those cases are not worth a lot nowdays
i did quite nicely from betting on csgo lounge the way the odds were set meant it was pretty easy to find good bets as people would heavily bet on the more popular teams and with best of 1s upsets were pretty frequent glad i stayed away from the skin casino sites after lounge disappeared as you could lose money so much faster on them
euros lost on dota2lounge was enough for me never bet on sea
the era of phantomlord faze tmartin guys were straight up just stealing skins with rigged rounds still blows my mind they should straight up be in jail
basically this i lost all of my redlines on some of the safe bets taught me a relatively cheap lesson
i used to do this as well but than i didnt enjoy watching games anymore i took the safe route and stopped gambling and just kept watching x200b only gamble i like and do is poker with friends with 10euro dollar buy in
on overwatch loot boxes when it came out and i have never felt emptier after all those boxes gave me nothing i wanted vowed never to buy boxes gamble ever again
runescape duel arena for me
thats how gambling gets you i just lost money but man that guy just won i can do it
i m over 1m in debt due to gambling and my decisions regarding same i also lost my job a few months ago and will lose severance soon i have ruined my life and find it hard to not cry every day i cannot believe how much gambling can be advertised to children more people are going to end up like me
you regularly see them on reddit talking about how reddit is does x or protesting covid with signs saying i don t care if i have to bury my family they never include themselves in their assesments because they think they re special and different
crypto and nft bros think this a lot and is why they push so heavily into it they hope to either be one of the lucky ones that can cash out before the rugpulls crashes or they hope to be able to be the one that rug pulls
happened to me with nicotine
best part is that he probably would have never got there until he was influenced by hasan own your actions applies to everyone
i am the exception i actually use my brain anyone who expects to win big and make a living off gambling is an idiot and deserves to lose their money
everyone is the exception very few people who gamble wind up like this you re the same way you likely participate in gambling like activities without spending all your money
that is a lot of money to a lot of people good on you

easy like
i m a moonmoon enjoyer but the other day he was starting a level that clearly had the australian flag on it and you know what he did i couldn t believe it i started shaking immediately he misidentified the flag as new zealand whilst violently shaking i managed to write a stern message to him on twitch chat and i knew he saw it because i saw my message reflected clearly on his shiny forehead and you know what he said nothing he just smirked and went on playing it was an easy level so obviously he liked it
its a really sobering realization that a lot of the people who make fun of me for watching the cum joke baldy are watching streamers who scream about gambling and raping people
whoever made that level should be reported to the international court of justice
you clipped too early and left out the best part when moon starts complaining he can t even skip the level because you can t open the menu in a warp pipe
super mario maker levels are all the evidence you should need as to why abortions need to be legal

he had to sign the contract fast so that otk lawyers could continue to delay his extradition for his participation in the january 6th riots as a leader
its a tradition at this point that anyone that passes through miz s house yoinks a bunch of merch since they basically have a room packed with boxes of the stuff
looking forward to the day asmongold associates with otk
why
hate boner is strong with this one
mizkif hd pro max
more like misterkif instead of miz
for real where are my mizkif and xqc clips wtf is going on
because i m assuming he s streaming a lot and people find the clips entertaining or was it a rhetorical question and you just don t like the guy
as a leader
which is smart a move imo trick streamers into thinking hey i m getting otk merch for free and then they wear it on stream and advertise the brand to their audience ez clap
have you seen the steaks asmon eats
you can go bald if you watch him for too long
deleted
asmon is extremely misogynistic
i don t think anyone s getting tricked here
or the takes he cooks
too late for that
name three
name some
i ve been watching him since july and have never seen a hint if that so imma need a citation
really you think he intentionally stormed the capitol
and the steaks he cooks
diablo iv will be good and cared for piracy is evil idk also more like opinions
first thing that comes to mind is a girl was making a joke about why her afk screen gets more viewers then when she is on camera and asmon says viewers are watching just so they can stare at and take a video of your ass dumb shit like that is said all the time
kind of he planned on storming it for other reasons it just happened to be the same day as the others
should ve storm with some merch sponsored by starforgesystems com
i mean regarding the first one he does seem overly positive about the game which then makes viewers like the game which gives him more views for when he streams it i kinda dislike that but it s business and i think the game will be cared for bugs and server issues will get fixed sooner or later then a large patch for each season and probably some dlcs but will the game be good hard to tell before we ve seen the launch server stability bugs and end game i really don t understand why people pre order it knowing none of those things
how is saying that misogynist he was literally correct if youre a hater just say so no need to give nonsense reasons
coomers do that all the time though why is pointing it out misogynistic also whenever his chat starts demeaning women for their appearance asmon always makes a point to stop the video and denounce it and say that his mods are going to go back and ban everyone whether they actually ban them all or just use it as a scare tatic to get them to behave i don t know but either way it seems the opposite of misogynistic
this is basically the premise of a curb your enthusiasm episode lmao
saying people only watch a woman because of her appearance when she is dressed normally is an incredibly fucked up thing to say this is just one example out of dozens but i m not going to go chase down clips
except thats not what he said you re making up arguments in your own head and arguing against that i cant help someone who argues with their own conjured arguments

he has a manual ford mustang btw

its always a flashbang seeing him like pretty beefy

i love how the twitch clip is no longer available but it will live on in clip mirror
nice cars but how many times in a year do they actually drive them to to train buying a stupendously overly expensive car is part of the norm since he is just a poser and a bragger but emiru s choice is interesting why the corvette i wonder
these streamers don t actually have super cars do they they don t leave their fucking house so why would they have them renting them for photo shoots i get
florida man energy off the roof lmao he reps his state with that epic mount

he be glazing fr fr s
literally
come on guys we almost made the subgoal of subs just 4k more we can do it goes on to complain about tipping their delivery driver for ordering food at 1am btw which they have come to their house times a day thanks for the gifted man i really appreciate it
the fact that these multimillionaire streamers that have huge sponsorships tons of subs and the like even have a donate button is something else
never donated never subbed stolen laptop neighbor s wi fi
imagine donating to nmp lol
gotta make sure their hiscore keeps going up while ya ll barely avoid the breadlines
people who donate or sub to these mega streamers are brain dead
this is why the only streamer i watch is vinesauce he actively tells people not to donate to him and is a humble dude
handbuilt by his father iirc
not with that attitude
the difference is that adin ross s is owned by andrew tate moist owns his
he s always being driven in the back of an suv lol
donating to anyone with over subs is baffling to me but hey it s their money
he gets to keep half a mclaren
doesn t even matter he makes so much money from gamba he could buy an entire plane of those and everybody knows that he is a chronical liar so one more lie doesn t really matter at this point
he might or might not be a liar but everyone can see the house he lives in now and the lambo would cost a lot less than that house
wouldnt be the first time he lied about owning a car
even if is not his lambo he surely can affort a couple ones with dirty gamba money but yeah
rent free
y all will do anything to turn a thread into being anti train haha
and he said he bought it for 5m where svj is around 900k used at the time

because the cost to power ratio is one of the highest among cars you can buy
because corvette is one of the cheaper ones you could get
same reason billionaires buy yachts they never use
same reason you buy condoms
promoting sex toys without on the channel in the title pepehands
what does anyone need a corvette for
driving what does anyone need a corvette for
nobody in the world needs a corvette
going fast
what exactly is your concern with her owning a vette it s a hell of a lot more reasonable than the lambo or a mclaren such a weird one to focus on
no one needs a corvette to live but have you ever participated in something fun before
mostly for photoshoots and to fit in better with the guys oh and to impress male fans
i d do the same but only if she agrees to let me fill her with my seed until she bears my child
yes they are legally required to be cute
love these guys full dickriding
that s indeed the joke that they were making
reminds me of bahroo when he had that sub counter showing active subs and whenever it dipped below that he would tell chat to sub yea guys you can do it lets go 25k yeahhhh then the drama happened and for a short time his sub counter went down to like 15k then 10k less and less he hasnt been the same ever since makes you wonder how these people cope when their income is suddenly cut in half but they cant just change employers like people can do with irl jobs so they are stuck being paid half as much as they used to get paid who am i kidding tho lets not pity people who make a million a year
i d honestly rather have waiters do stuff like that to asks for tips because at the end of the day no one not even the streamer will care if you didn t tip instead of currently if you didn t tip a waiter there s a chance they ll chew you out give you hostile service next time might even spit on your food and everyone else would view you as an asshole
the ones i watch eventually stopped calling out dono s or just muted them all together i wonder why
i don t know why it s both either take the big contracts from platforms and do the sponsorships or take subs and donos doing both is fundamentally weird
why would they take it away if they re still raking in a ton of money from donations
for many you are essentially paying for tts more channel emotes and no ads
moms account ez
he needs more donos i mean have you seen his car
the dick riding is insane lol how do we know exactly who owns what and how they could both be leases lol

i feel dumber every time i hear xqc speak trying to piece together what he says is harder than solving a cryptex

i agree that differences in opinion between adults isn t necessarily drama yet when you start calling people hypocrites due to these differences it almost definitely becomes drama

i can t listen to xqc talk for more than seconds lol
debate
why are people treating this like you have to pick one side or the other how about criticize both sides and both sides just own up to their faults i don t think it s fair to say that just because adin ross showed porn on stream that qt charlie shouldn t be criticized it already sounds like charlie didn t realize how easy it was to see actual porn on fansly and he owned up to that but he shouldn t have to die on a hill defending himself or even try to own up and move on
x really needs to just take a proper debate class from destiny or some teacher he s got good points generally but is horrible at articulating them properly or reasoning beyond emotions
who cares though go touch grass everybody
what s the argument against labeling your stream as when you are sponsored by fansly it costs nothing to label you stream that so why is it too much to ask if anything fansly should not be allowed to advertise on twitch period youtube is currently demonetizing people for swearing seriously mild swearing by the way while twitch is debating advertising porn websites
wonder why the front page isn t filled with xqc clips in the past hours clueless

whenever xqc adds an adverb to a sentence there s a high probability he has no clue what that word means and is just trying to flourish the argument

adin and xqc are grown immature kids when it comes to their reasoning with no logic or sense they literally have never grown up and keep doing what they did when they were 13yos that applies to a pretty big chunk of streamers especially the big ones
he gets away with saying dumb and braindead takes every time under the guise of pepega goblino toenail andy etc but people need to stop treating him like a man baby and actually hold him accountable considering how big of a platform he has for the shit he says and not just push it under the rug because hes dumb if he doesn t know a word or topic then he shouldn t speak about it or better yet educate himself rather than pulling the oh im dumb braincell andy card

i love baus watch every daily upload same as tyler the only thing i ll say is baus was for sure griefing with that ap irelia pick recently lol
admittedly tyler does go on to say baus himself isn t bad he doesn t dislike him he just has a problem with people emulating how he plays while not wanting to win and his playstyle making the threshold for a feeding ban higher on euw
sadge
awww
i recently got a week ban for trying to emulate baus playstyle so what tyler is saying isnt completely true
don t think he ll have to worry about meeting his hero the hero has been hardstuck lp masters for a while now
this actually made me sad wtf lol poor baus actually looked so upset
didn t bauss also get challenger in korea though do they not have macro there either
ironic for t1 to accuse another streamer of being a negative influence on league game quality
poor baus he deserves better
please explain i dont understand the context whats his playstyle i dont play league
i m not a lol player can someone explain how they would be on the same team and someone would be feeding and still gain lp
i was looking forward to seeing tyler take on the euw server but his constant bickering and flame of the server has made me stop watching all together especially catering to this room temperature iq debate of na vs eu
oof he actually about to start crying
i love baus s stream and hes a beast at his inting strats but tyler has a point even if baus is insanely successful at it he now introduced thousands of players to his strat and worse players will try it instead of learning full map macro they only learn inting sion macro so if things dont go normal they are just inting
it s soloq he can do w e he wants but it s not fun to play with a sion it is what it is
yikes man he actually legit seemed hurt by that i feel sad
kesheuw sanest eu player and best
if anything tyler has a worse influence on league players
the irony of t1 judging someone that got famous of intentionally feeding in league lmao
oof baus is genuinely the chillest high elo streamer i mean tyler s not wrong but damn still pretty harsh
deleted
it s amazing what you can do if you just make it your personality imagine the power you have over your audience when every horrible thing you say is treated as part of the joke even when there s no punchline and anyone who gets offended just doesn t get the joke
tyler is just copying he can t climb in euw his friend tarzaned also came to euw few years ago and couldn t hit above master
i have no idea who this is
deleted
someone explain in overwatch terms
t1 can criticize his play style all he wants but as soon as he starts with the personal insults reject it s hard to sympathize with his take totally not cool to make personal attacks against another streamer just because his play style triggers you
idolizes an idiot thats famous for beign toxic and going off at everyone gets flamed by idol surprized pikachu face
tyler1 the most unhinged toxic psychopath to ever play league is caing someone else plahstyle toxic for the game you can t make that shit up lmao

yea he clearly griefs for content when the dude plays off stream he hits chally with like wr or some shit
i absolutely fucking hate people who copy baus like dude were bronze you are not good enough to copy his playstyle
may i ask what his playstyle is
to be fair baus also got a week ban for doing his own playstyle
deleted
post opgg
then you can get unbanned if you just send a ticket as the system is supposd to punish intentionally feeding and not people having bad scores for reference i went like as yasuo after this sytem was implementend and riot unbanned me after i sent a ticket asking them to review the game as i was just having a really shitty game vs akali rework
bro how can you be so dumb you can t emulate baus playstyle otherwise you would be challenger you re just inting in silver pls use your brain
i had a rammus top pretty much running it down not too long ago and they said they were just emulating baus was that you
if tyler1 is your hero you should be happy if he flames you
i mean tyler was the goat of running it down maybe thats why he s baus hero
isn t baus lp masters
people were rumoring about thebaus getting boosted on offstream account on stream he s also hardstuck masters
if you watch the original clip tyler is bruuutaaaal with what he says to baus i felt bad i watch them both and baus is a nice guy tyler mainly just has an issue with the consequences of baus s influence on players and the game
and t1 is generally thought to be a pretty nice dude when he is being tyler not t1 you do have to wonder how much of it is the persona i don t think anyone actually thinks baus has singlehandedly changed euw
baus jokes around a lot i m sure he was playing it up a little but yeah obviously being shit on never feels good
korean solo q is like skill checking your opponent into ff15ing
they famously do not
nah only the dogshit na server where not even pros like to q there lmao
no you don t get it he s reformed riot will take away his addiction if he doesn t behave
tyler still mad because he lacked the can win attitude needed to reach challenger in korea
he often intentionally throws his life away in order to make plays based on macro to sacrifice his life for objectives
basically his playstyle is dying a lot which is not fun for his teammates but he is getting counterplay by splitpushing lanes so enemies waste time killing him while his team can takes objectives push other lanes you have to pray your teammates dont tilt and dont lose lane or it s lost baus has very good knowledge of this playstyle and it can work rly well he has achieved highest rank in the game doing it but can be very coinflip if the game goes bad people complaining a lot about his playstyle cuz he is basically suiciding intentionally which is very bad
play sion farm past turret die over and over again lose game
it s essentially manipulating the game in a way that s not meta accruing lane advantages and pushing towers while dying his kda might look like feeding but his dmg output and dmg on towers is ridiculously high he s contributing to the game win by a huge margin it s not really the method that s the problem it s a valid playstyle just not a very fun one to play with or against the main issue are the copycats that grief and how it forces your team to play sidelanes which isn t always the best move for your team comp in solo queue
thebaus mains sion which has a passive that turns him into a very strong zombie for a few seconds when he dies he also benefits a lot from killing npcs because of this baus dies a lot in order to secure as many resources as possible making the death worth it
at the end of the day you have to remember that technically you dont have to kill enemies to win the game the only thing that matters is pushing the enemys base and killing their nexus so this kinda stuff is pushing that kinda angle to the max in heroes of the storm they had a similar time with a character called leoric where he can respawn faster hitting enemies and push lanes pretty hard while also being pretty strong 1v1 so you would just push hard fight off people 1v1 and then if you died to a gank you could just respawn pretty fast and repeat while hopefully your teammates can take advantage of 4v3 or whatever
can t really blame him for getting angry at the server when he was getting the likes of syndra or the riven he s gotten on multiple occasions who runs down his games
tyler gets sniped and inted a lot it s no wonder he is deranged
it s not his fault he s good at the way he plays and people are imitating him poorly the fuck do you expect him to do about it if you want to lay the blame on anyone it should be on riot for allowing the play style to even be remotely viable
silver players are inting at whatever playstyle otherwise they wouldn t be silver
playing with sion can be fine but it s the way he plays sion lol
don t hate the player hate the game edit league players in still coping that their game doesn t suck when literally everyone including t1 complains about the state of league every single day
trueeeeeeeeeeeee
funny considering that baus is one of the best macro players in eu edit na tools downvoting despite the fact that baus is in top challenger every single season doing the same tactic lol
i have no idea why you felt the need to comment this
i have no idea who you are either
not sure where you got that idea
he s doing a bit in case it wasn t obvious
his winrate irelia is because of his bad teamates not the build ok copesen
i know it s only small reason to play it but she does have a massive total ap ratio if i m remembering right
if he included a bork in the build it would probably be ok because then his autos wouldn t be completely useless
zwag made a video too lmao
he hit rank euw on his off stream account recently
yeah but like if you re matched with bronze players are you good enough to tell people what to do
it s really fun though
it s hard to describe but i ll try baus has a very good grasp on death timings wave timings and cs in general add to that his good macro and micro and he s actually a very good player he dies a lot and trades his life for waves towers pushes and micro advantages problem is people try to play like him and sit in side lanes push die without having the skill of timing their deaths and knowing the difference between a good and bad death the same way baus does plus with his very good cs ing and rotations he keeps about 10cs min and is present for most big fights which means he doesn t fall behind after dying as often as he does when someone without his skill tries to emulate it it means multiple bad things they feed their opponent by repeatedly dying but don t have the mechanics and knowledge to match them when it matters they end up dying in side lanes when big objectives are up which means the objective is basically insta lost their deaths are at odds with wave states so they end up falling behind on gold and exp the team ends up being player down since they re so behind while the enemy team has an extra strong player because of the lane feels like a 4v5 constantly at least that s how i see it it might not be fully accurate though
his champion is a lategame monster and his passive temporarily resurrects him for like seconds as long as he s hitting something he uses this to suicide for minionwaves when it otherwise wouldn t be safe to do so he also goes behind turrets to farm the minions before they arrive in lane which forces the enemy laner to have to choose between farming or stopping him it makes him very suspectible to the jungler support but it s not that bad even if he dies as it reveals where the jungler last was and gives them the opportunity of taking dragon all in enemy botlane

of course you were totally normal yasou player gameplay
if you are actually trying it s fairly difficult to get banned in the first place so i m not surprised you were able to get unbanned i ve never been banned and i usually only play when i m not in the best mind state aka drinking and i ll talk a little bit of shit usually only if someone says something to me i think it might be also that if you have an older account that purchased a lot of rp that it s more difficult to get banned
how do you die times in a game and even pretend that it either wasn t intentional or that you have some kind of disability that you are either not aware of or not making everybody else aware of in your comment
im inting in plat actually
it s amazing what you can get away with if you make it your character and have a funny voice
new goat of running it down is that one mentally unstable dude multiboxing accounts and running it down on all of them at the same time all while streaming
this is him aswell rank https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/horse%20tongue)
with how many inters he meets who just play braindead the second they see his name his main is cursed
bro is 4funning with no delay no map cover no bitches and still hovers mid masters hes bing chilling
if you watch the offstream games the account plays using baus style pretty hard to see how a booster would boost emulate baus style at once hard to win consistently as a rammus top
it seems like every league personality loves baus as a person but hates his playstyle i remember drututt got so tilted at baus a while ago he disliked him i think they made up but still

why does anyone even watch this guy i heard from his top moderator that he s an incel who hates vaccines and women
hello i like money
when a jan insurrectionist is the least controversial member
yeah they can have him replace the weird unfunny guy who doesn t stop talking what was his name tectone
squeex helped me carry nancy pelosi s podium out of her office
yeah republicans and neonazis went to the capitol with the intent to overturn the election and even called for the lynching of the vice president later on someone ended up dying along with capitol police officers yeah
mar is and still in high school needs a number of years before that makes sense she s just a mizkif viewer flash in the pan right now but will grow squeex will neff or filian will be next will makes the most sense
i ll take anyone but tectone at this rate i try to watch him but the dude is going to need to fall further before he can get back up if at that
if i heard it right it seems miz told mar to focus on school before going full time livestreaming so i don t see them signing her rn
jan 6th
squeex was the lovely guy who held the door open to the capital during the jan 6th riots he visited austin tx and there is speculation he may join a known sex cult otk
she s still in 100t but decided to temporarily remove her association because her health makes it difficult to assist with content creation i wouldn t count on her ever joining otk since she s good friends with 100t people and they re the la org besides she s too big to take any financial incentive it would be like asmon leaving otk to join a smaller org in another state
squeex i mean why else do you think he was out in austin doing streams with them they were obviously seeing if it was a good fit
i think its because of the juxtaposition of his alt right values and the nostalgic child like innocence of super mario honestly its an interesting combination that shouldn t work in theory but for some reason it does
apparently rich is the only reason he even got an invite too
last i heard cops died at the hands of those nazis
neo nazi transphobic racist fascist homophobic xenophobic xylophonic terf white supremacist alt right dog whistling bigots
lol
yeah mar is a pretty good prospect should def be a top10 pick could potentially develop as an elite streamer in
what content creation
only at least cops killed by mr a r insurrectionist on that dark day
i assume the boomer vs zoomer podcast and the main channel 100t videos
t shirt and bad podcast creation

clip mirror trains roasts adin for pandering to his audience https://arazu.io/t3_12auxcy/)** this is an automated comment
i m starting to think that kick is secretly being run by vince mcmahon
wouldnt it be amazingn if adin actually left the internet for ever and we never had to see his dumbass and bigot friends ever again
man kick is really revolutionizing streaming instead of having discussions with talent behind closed doors they re just doing it out in the open truly a step forward
train constantly deletes his tweets though because he can t handle the backlash
lol train is so hard to predict
this is the smartest thing train has ever said since he started streaming
the funniest part about this clip is it s from the same day where train was top of lsf for not going hard enough on adin it just got completely ignored
but he still won t give him a day ban for saying he wants to kill nonbinary people who cares what he says if he doesnt actually do something about it
damn just wait till bronny james gets huge famous in the nba and people pull up clips of him playing cod or 2k with a nazi sympathizer
that s true true aaaaaaaaaaaand yeah that s pretty true that s true and yeah that s true that s true that s true that s pretty true that s pretty true i mean inhales that s true yeah that s true uhm that s true that s fuckin true uhm that s how it is dude
was good until the dest soy yawn
common squeex w
its rare to see train have absolute clarity on a matter
that s my react streamer feelsstrongman
holy gigachad
what game is he playing
even when trains right he makes himself sound so fucking unlikable lol
why every train stuff gets shown in destiny streams are they friends or something because if not they should
thats true adin is saying sexist incel takes to appeal to tate fans and the w community while train has been saying this for years because he means it
feels like this is just who he is
aiden is a follower he is an impressionable naive little boy he is the embodiment of his audience train has hitched his wagon to a moronic wildcard
you know you might be onto something
it s me adin it was me all along
train would look fucking rad turning up on stream with the vince mcmahon cut https://i.imgur.com/mxqzhsv.jpg)
i actually laughed out loud it s attitude era on twitch kick
the wwe endeavour ufc merger is nuts jon jones undertaker hell in a octagon when
after the news that he s back in charge of creative i came to lsf to get away from the bad news i just can t at least we can look forward to dynamite https://preview.redd.it/frqvlyx8qtra1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5aae6381ca9fedceaccfb6e9440bd1192077d615) this week
ah shit that means brock lesnar is coming to kick
this is such good shitt
i love vince so much good content
kick gives me more wcw vibes
train did it for the rock
this archetype did not begin and will not end with adin there are an untold amount of kids who could suddenly become internet famous and subsequently lose themselves to the money fame and influence i read a series of tweets from his alleged half brother and it s made abundantly clear that he is no longer the same person he used to be
the cx roaches are still crawling on youtube somewhere tough critters
adin fuckin sucks but his friends man god damn
someone will rise to take his place his dumbass viewers will find someone to idolize
yea
i ve avoided everything adin related you should give it a try might help your sanity a little
i ve said ban the entire w community and have been downvoted for it nothing but hate coming from the streamers and their viewers
we can only dream
god i hope that happens or he s streaming on some shit stain platform we don t ever have to hear about
isn t this called transparency
kick operating things like trump transparency baby
it s not even the backlash lol train deletes his tweets when they don t get enough likes because he wants his twitter to look as big as possible you will notice every train tweet is an intentional farm for as many likes as possible and when the tweet doesn t perform well he ll delete it train is essentially the insecure e girl who deletes the ass pics that don t perform well because she wants to look more relevant than she is
so everyone cries that train isn t outspoken about adins bad actions but when he finally does say something we can all agree on he still isn t doing it right lulw classic
truee
he saw that adin wont be streaming and probably told him the same in private so he was like fuck it i am gonna say what i think
he wanted to ban adin for for that stunt but other owners didn t vote for that
tbh i think little by little adin ross is rubbing off on train he s starting to see how much of a risk adin is
not true that one time he said he d suck a long schlong was pretty based
trying to be the good guy dude whas always like this and fail
because it s not up to train he s just a consultant at kick and he talked with destiny on stream about how he thought the punishment should have been harsher and was talking to the owners about how the moderation needs to be smarter about things
they are billions quite fun
train and destiny are good pals
i love that
can t wait for another spotfest with zero story lmao
brock only does ppv these days and doesnt give a shit about these kids i think we are safe
someone didnt watch last night aware
it was confirmed he wasn t adins brother he was grifting
are they really i haven t heard about cx in years man during peak edgy internet
sucks he s just as shitty as them have we forgot the recent kill them incident fuck all of them
you re in a thread about adin my dude
i would guess its to farm the algorithm to think he s more popular so it suggests he content more much like dream deleted all of his old content right before he made the pewdiepie seed video that way youtube thinks he only made great video and everyone is watching it so they recommend his content everywhere if you see influencers do weird stuff on a social media site its usually some way to exploit the social media metrics to get their content suggested more
you re spending way too much time on his twitter
train doesn t have a filter which is why he says so many stupid things but he s always been like that he doesn t need a reason
that s not what rubbing off on means i think you mean wear on
it s not even little by little whenever they have conversations you can usually tell how miserable train is at the thought that he s trying to go to war with twitch and the face on the frontlines is leroy jenkins
only one time kappa
it would be based if it wasnt blatant gaybaiting
i m glad he finally put co owner in his bio so we can stop with this just a consultant advisor narrative
https://prnt.sc/4hdkrgppkyel](https://prnt.sc/4hdkrgppkyel) clueeeeeee
isnt he the co owner
make sence filthy assholes like each others usually
aew is absolute garbanzo man i just love that picture because it s funny
a wear woah cage
if you think cx was the peak of edgy internet then i am getting way too old for this website
theres a big one called mizkif you mightve heard of him
bro they re amog us right now
my wording was intentional adin is garbage but his friends are worse i m not trying to excuse his behavior or downplay it at all have you ever seen a neon stream i tuned in for a couple minutes the other day and it was pure toxicity
key phrase i gave was i ve avoided not i m avoiding meaning i have up till this point
this is literally every train action for the last few years train is basically an npc
you just need to days to notice this
how would something like this even take time to notice i just see he deletes all the tweets that don t pop off
gaybaiting is the most overused misunderstood term train isn t saying that shit to lead on gay people lmao
afaik he accepted their deal on becoming a co owner pretty recently or is finalising it at the moment so it s more of a precise description thing not some shyness
just going by what i last heard him say about it regardless fact remains that he can t instantly have things work the way he wants them to
being a co owner doesn t mean you get to make all the decisions especially if you have less than ofthe company
gacha games are gambling
ehhh it depends maybe not fully peak edgy internet as a whole cus who s beating 4chan but in the streaming space early twitch cx was definitely the peak for edgy content then
aware same
miz and erobb made it out of the favelas of streaming
hahaha dude neon s stream has to be the most unhinged stream across all of twitch and kick insane shit
ok well i ve avoided eating between lunch and dinner nice logic
yup he s been like this for years now
train is a pretty unique dude far from an npc he just pulls some fairly shady stunts for personal gain
train defended him not being banned and giving him a chance for redemption even though he s been doing stupid stuff like this consistently so even if we roll with the narrative that train has no power even from his own words he still wouldn t have banned him
no it was just runescape streamers tbh ice was just a popular one
do you mfs not know what past tense is the past simple tense of avoid is avoided google if you don t believe me
permabanned sure but there s a difference between that and arguing he should have had a longer one than the day ban he got

damn prods got a boat docked at his place
if he moves it won t be exclusive he will prob stream on twitch then be contracted to x amount of hours a month on kick which he will probably just gamble during
if there s one thing i learned from onlyfans it s that it s not the real amouranth in your dm s
feelsdankman i didn t see it where s the leak
amouranth and and dandangler in his leaked dms too
twitch did this to themselves when they announced the new reduced split is pretty ridiculous
classic twitter leak lulw
i paused and read those messages for five minutes trying to find any relevance to kick then i finished the rest of the video
i saw the messages and idk where this kick claim comes from cuz im stupid but i was surprised to see dandangler in his dms lul
you can tell a juicer posted this them along with erobbs fans have the worst grasp of the english language i ve ever witnessed
i love gamba gamba gamba book book book join kick pagman
power hour
lmao this cannot be real
imagine streaming on kick
they need to implement mod tools first now they only have individual bans or timeouts when destiny moved there would be like chatters that would spam racial slurs and it just ruins chat when a mod isn t there individually banning burner accounts i can t imagine a chat as big as xqc s without basic mod tools
real
kick and stake got unreal money seeing them in sports jeresy and racecar really puts things into perspective
she said yes
least pepega kick streamer
x is big enough to do whatever he wants and be fine but there is nothing to gain past a small cash bump in early subs and everything to lose once fans start to move on and he s tied down like every other kick streamer they ll probably just be twitch streamers who spend a couple hours on kick producing their worst content because they can
w if true cuz we could finally watch him without ads lmao
that reaction was too genuine to be trolling lol he signing
it will be interesting to see how long all this kick money will last because they can t be making any money off the site itself
everything i read about kick sounds like a bad thing like twitches eveil brother locked in the basement
dandangler and amouranth don t fumble it agane mr cow
good riddance
twitch is ass anyway
i mean i d stop watching
kick would be a serious player with xqc and adin top streamers in terms of average viewers and with adin streaming more on kick probably top watches streamer itw
are creators and people really that stupid why do you think they are offering a fucking rev split on everything charity morons are acting like they are doing it becausue they care about the creator when its all just an ad for stake and they make x10 of their money back they don t give a fuck about creators or people
faked outraged against twitch to justify the move to his juicers kekw
deleted
no he won t
ew
at this point he deserves to be on kick
what was xqc take reading the first lsf post saying a girl was uncomfortable cus of the sexiest rape comments of adin kick stream
bro he screams at amouranth dickheads
dude after seeing a dude allowing his fans to threat rape against a girl you have on i cannot say that my first impulse would be i should move over to his streaming platform

not sure why people love to point out spelling grammar mistakes on the internet this place is multinational english could be op s 2nd 3rd or 4th language maybe just for easy upvotes which is pathetic to care about
boats and hoes boats and hoes i gotta have me my boats and hoes
most deals where streamers have been moving to kick are non exclusive where they can and should be streaming all content on all platforms they use that doesn t break that sites tos which means he probably wouldn t have required hours that wouldn t be simultaneously streamed on other platforms
thats probably part of the deal they don t want him to stop streaming on twitch they want all the year olds to follow over and watch him gamble
it s actually more beneficial for streamers to monetize all platforms as much as they can exclusive contracts are becoming a thing of the past
w business idea
deleted
but god knows how he s a degen it s literally sad to see when he gambles would be kick s best signing ever cause we all know it would be kick gambling twitch
he leaked twitter dm s but then says i thought i leaked my kick thing oh my god okay well so he accidentally leaked it himself when he said it he never showed anything
buddy amouranth was over at his house how do you think that happened telepathy ofc they message each other
probably said what he said so people don t speculate about this
this is him being pissed at gambling being mad not twitch s revenue split
he said i thought i leaked my kick thing
surprised she looks like those girls in his tiktok likes lmao
she was on his love or host
they
so embarrassing lmao you tried so hard to make that sentence coherent yet still failed

my english go bad when watch erik build shed like caveman

how about you try speaking another language other than english
what do you mean you telling me xqc isn t the online english tutor i was supposed to be learning from
ok but who cares
fuck twitch
if you can t imagine it just look at adins chat
wtf i havent seen a single ad in twitch in years after installing ublock
no w because all we will see is gambling on kick and that sucks bigtime
they re not trying to make money off kick as a platform it s basically a high tech stake com billboard they have an insane sub split so they make no money off subs the content is too unhinged to get any monetisation via ads stake clearly reckon that the operating costs of the platform will work out to be less than the money they can make off advertising slots honestly it ll probably work and the gambling portion of the site will just subsidise the public facing side i imagine some of the streamers they re trying to sign won t stream slots so there will be some clean faces to legitimise the whole thing
i don t think that it will stake needs the bet volume and customer base for money laundering and propping up kick is still much more cost effective than money laundering the old fashioned way
it s already shown lots more signs of having staying power than i ever imagined there s a chance it will stay around imo
imagine if steph curry and lebron james went to the euroleague instead of the nba are they competitors now to the global brand not even close this scenario is even less impactful than that
man somw people really dont know more than twitch usa at this point eu twitch is much lucrative
didnt kai also sign a contract or was that whole contract leak situation just made up
i think you mean xqc is watching a police chase delayed will someone die
might goes
nachos lemonheads my dad s boat ya won t go down cuz my dick can float
it wouldn t be a very good deal if there s no required hours we will pay you to stream on our website sometimes like he could just not stream and keep the money lol
i mean like every other streamer whos going to kick they arnt signing exclusives because kick doesn t want to pay the enormous amount for that even if the streamers wanted it kick is taking advantage of twitch cutting costs by not re signing top streamers to exclusive contracts by doing the same but for less money and hours but just getting the names there legitimizes their site
that doesn t even make sense why would he say that
lsf user discovers messaging friends through dm s is a normal social practice lule
not even just being over at his house amouranth has been going off on networking lately pornstar pool streams and the like somethings coming im sure
hahaha
so taking is ok because of what kick bad

niche within the footballing world makes sense not exactly a lot of south koreans playing at the top level
it is a niche county in terms of football there are maybe a half dozen top level south korean players and there are very few south korean s playing in any of the top leagues
ah yes the football powerhouse south korea with many famous teams such as and

clip mirror moistcr1tikal says advertising fansly to a young audience will always be not a great decision https://arazu.io/t3_12agcsm/)** this is an automated comment
this clip just blew my mind and made me say wow what a hot take out loud
charlie coming in with the hottest most controversial takes known to man
honestly most advertising that is targeted at kids and there is a lot that you wouldn t even notice should be seen as immoral even when the product is innocent like a car etc
clearly we just get pornhub ads instead if you re gonna turn kids into coomers might as well teach them not to pay hundreds to thousands of dollars for it jesus
the party that minx ruined wasn t going to pay for itself
according to lsf when slots is on a stream twitch chat is kids when it s porn the twitch chat is turkish adults
what does ja rule think
protecting the children is this subs new favorite dog whistle fuck them kids
i m gonna go a step further and say that advertising to kids in general is not great
he s being a bit disingenuous here for one if i am not mistaken hot tub streamers are usually listed as that doesn t mean i am arguing that it s suppose to stop the underaged from accessing the stream regardless my point is the streamer awards weren t even listed as and was advertising fansly a site that actually shows full blown nudity people have tested fansly out including xqc himself which he changed his take on fansly recently on his offline chat people were able to get access to some nudity content even if you put your birthday year as for example so yeah his take here isn t honest
you definitely don t get more pornography on twitch than on fansly it s not about the ad itself it s about the site that it promotes that s why even links to onlyfans pages are banned on twitch they only got away with that ad because it was a massive event and no explicit content was shown
his unpassionate uber centrist reasonableness is like eating unseasoned mash potatoes
this is so brave i wish all the lsf streamers have this exact same opinion and we can have a clip of it
i bet the click through rate on those fansly ads is at least just think of all the underaged young men that could have been saved from a fate of fappin to a fansly vid of amouranth sucking on a dildo if they had been too busy playing slots while watching train this is all hasan s fault
ofc its bad unless your favourite lsf streamer who endorsed it they need any sponsor they could take get that bread king queen
holy shit you know lsf is reaching for drama when this month old topic is still being brought up
why are we taking this kind of advice from the guy who plays with massive fake penises
if you put your hand in fire it will hurt
so i checked and exactly same ad aired during chess boxing where were threads malding about it then or even during jermas baseball incels working overtime
these male streamers always say stuff like this but when it comes to xqc farming booba content tiktoks or having his dad rate female streamers that s perfectly fine for a young audience
i would have no idea what fansly is if it wasn t for all that drama on lsf most people give fuck
i didn t even know what fansly was in until i watched an asmongold video talking about the drama it seems kinda hypocritical but i guess fansly get consent from the person i thought it was just a gaming thing at least streamers have never taken an alcohol sponsor to promote drinking to an underage audience oh wait
the dev that worked on the twitch integration to fansly was so fucking lazy all they needed was a modal with an age verification form that s it that s all they fucking needed to do for this to all be irrelevant yes fansly isn t a great product to be advertising on a kid friendly platform especially with how it was promoted like it was something more akin to patreon but we ve been using sex to sell shit forever this isn t a new practice we just need to follow the fucking are you rule i ve been using the internet since i was a teenager and you bet your fucking ass i used it to look at porn but _most_ of the time i had to lie to get to it that s it that s the only valid complain anyone has here
free mukitty
well someone is not getting invited to next years circle jerk awards show
unless you have a fansly because then you re about to get a bunch of irresponsible parent credit card charges
ahhhh the agenda is slowly crashing down on those who were extremely vocal or friends with the people he s back pedaling a lottttt now that news are coming out that he is involved in how the tables have turned lmao
i assume most twitch veterans are child free so they dont see this side of it but onlyfans and similar sites have done a lot of damage to kids psychs all day long they scroll tiktok and youtube shorts and see rich onlyfans models they go on twitch and see their favorite streamer has an onlyfans they joke about their friends making pages even big non sexual yters are guilty of it markplier made a page recently being sexually liberated and posting your nudes for is rad but the internet likes to wave these sites in kids faces along with glamorizing the people showing them playing games cosplaying travelling etc its not good
that s why xqc chat just spam pepenpc lul
im tired of streamers riding in on their high horse about ladies in bikinis its not their job to protect the worlds children from anything other than their terrible takes on life
twitch probably already charges them a premium because of how much money the porn industry is worth and they are willing to pay it twitch probably just sees dollar signs and tries to justify it by saying something stupid like oh if we don t then someone else will so we don t mind being the bad guy this is literally the problem with big corporations because they rather go for greed over safety of others
this is literally the big dog small dog meme
xqc reacts to fansly equivalent booba content on his stream every day most of the time those clips end up here too
go to the hot tub category lmao the need to defend his little streamer circle jerk is comical luckily he came to reason but we all know qt will play victim still and never take responsibility i wonder how many more times we will hear what real pain looks like while blaire whines like a spoiled brat
a take worth making a reddit post about make sure to clip it if he says the sky is blue
what does qt think of all of this going around any clips
i m never sure during these discussions if one side is just being super uncharitable by ignoring nuance or just completely incapable of seeing nuance advertising during an event for an a website that has pornographic content is different than showing actual pornographuc content the motive for qt to show that advertisement is to recoup the costs of putting on the event the motive for adin is because he s an edge lord these two things are not the same qt was upset at the deepfake because it was nonconsenual objectification its not hypocritical to promote a website that sells pornographic content while also not wanting to be the subject of pornographic content hasan has had literal pornstars on fear it doesn t make him hypocritical there is nuance to these things and i m really hoping everyone that cannot see this is just being disingenuous rather than stupid
fansly has got more advertisements from the prudes complaining about it than qt ever gave them in the first place i don t remember what the advertisement even was and i wouldn t have remembered the name fansly if it wasn t for you guys congrats on giving them free promos for the past month i m sure all these kids who you care about so much are really considering what you re all saying
there s a difference i feel between the way ludwig did it with just a bunch of mentions and how qt did with an ad that was very boundary pushing and i think qt even said she should have reviewed that commercial more carefully still not a great sponsor but no need for pitchforks
mukitty the goat
who even cares
the amount of people who are so upset by the fansly ad is so funny to me
i m sure y all will be consistent and also try to cancel jerma for this on your way to giving fansly more free advertising than they could have hoped for in their wildest dreams with this drama
from a legal standpoint i get the click to proceed if you re but what a totally shitty roadblock it s like putting a pile of leaves in front of a brontosaurus and going i dare you to step over that
watch the entire clip he s schmalding
but but it s ethical pron cuz consent probably some qt fans right now
but advertising guns is cherry picking what is acceptable sure is convenient
what does it mean to advertise to children people are giving qt shit for her fansly ad on streamer awards but were the streamer awards meant to be for kids and then for that matter how deep are we gonna go with this if a streamer has a of fansly does that mean they can t be on miz stream since he has a lot of children in his audience if he tells chat to go watch amouranth is that basically advertising porn to children
exactly stick to the classics like cigarettes booze and gambling
if qt is not being a hypocrite then no one cares about this and also this sneako bloke seems to stan her to death

watching otk do multiple fansly video ads where they showed e girls doing things maybe a young audience shouldn t be exposed to was crazy society seems he ll bent on trying to turn kids into porn addicts from a young age and after seeing a kid twerking on tiktok once and another clearly sexually suggestive one before quiting that shit it s clear this isn t just efecting consumption its encouraging production gross af imo keep this shit away from kids makes me almost want to need id for the internet so we can try to segregate the kids and adults but obviously there are big privacy issues with that
this coming from the guy talking about cock balls cum assfucking list goes on in every single video he makes he does realize his audience is the same age as these girls right
john wick has spoken
i think pornography and sex work are damaging to the mind and spirit i do not support sex workers i believe what they do hurts society
deleted
all advertising is bad for kids but these events need funding and nsfw sites aren t anything special
so now that moist has stated its always not a great decision does that mean i m allowed to participate to a conversation saying advertising fansly to a young audience is always not a great decision or am i still pissing against the wind
deleted
i m so tired of the but think of the children nonsense first off teens have locked at porn since people have drawn dicks on cave walls it s not a big deal if you don t like it parent your children instead of raising them with an ipad motherfuckers upset about this are the kind of people who would have gasped if they saw some ankles in victorian england and before the obligate rant about its about hypocrisy no it isn t because no rule on this site makes any sense but this is the only topic people can t stop yapping about
idk who we re talking about but if its qtcinderella no way she has a young audience
is this why he had stand ins for the streamer awards seems weird coming from him considering he has openly supported a twitch event that was sponsored by fansly
who the fuck cares we re heading to a dystopian future where people will kill each other with no consequences let s accelerate it fuck yeah
all of a sudden people here are like it s not a big deal and when aiden did it people were getting pitchfork iets be honest to ourselves and just say it doesn t matter because at the end of the day they are the one who is getting the bag and no matter how much we wine about it they won t care because they are getting the bag
https://www.reddit.com/r/livestreamfail/comments/129ve0u/xqcs_dad_is_unhinged/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1 crazy to me that people are getting this upset at qt for this but then they just laugh it off when xqc and his dad objectify women on stream
kids don t watch award shows when have u ever seen a kid sit down for hours and watch the oscars or the emmy s im sorry but that just doesn t happen
fansly is pointless you re paying for instagram pictures
he pulled out a gun in his video also i don t remember this controversy when jerma was doing his big stream
bro who cares about this i was watching porn when i was i bet these kids are already bingeing
all the people that were concern trolling about what adin was showing to minors well that card can backfire too
i don t understand why people bring up kids first in fansly gambling as a talking point kids don t have money for none of that you could say it s normalizing this behaviour to kids but i think the only one that gets targeted by these companies is adult with a job who can actually keep paying for services
i dont really see the big deal if some kid is watching those streams they already know about porn its not like that ad is exposing them to it
i m curious what everyone concerned about fansly thinks about kids under playing watching games like gta or witcher with extreme violence as well as nudity hey as long as they click they re over its no issue right like lets be real every kid is going to just click they re over and watch it regardless everyone did this when they were a kid and kids are no different nowadays should the stream have that restriction when advertising something like fansly yes but does it really matter that much no if anything the hot tub streamers all over twitch are much worse as they re basically using straight up soft porn as an advertisement for their onlyfans fansly
sex isn t scary and it isn t some forbidden practice nudity is not shameful nor should it be considered taboo or ungodly or whatever other excuse it s amazing that here in the united states we think advertising fansly to a younger crowd is mostly going to be considered a bad thing but you can literally walk down the streets of places like london and other places in europe and they have naked models on the stores and shit take away the fantasy and you take away a lot of the danger that comes with this excessive approach towards banning nudity or making it shameful and believing that sex or even sex work is somehow a bad thing
what a wise man only he could speak those words
til when you go to the beach you are surrounded by pornography
so if i m a parent and want to go to the pool or the beach with my kid i cant because there will be people with bikinis bikini and naked is a huge difference
three year account with negative comment karma this is not a regular reddit account lmao
those streams are why is everyone so disingenuous about this
are people comparing the audience of the streamer awards to adin ross when you say young audience what does that mean specifically whats the age range when people are mad at adin its for showing porn to kids because his audience is known to have lots of children who watch him
please titty streamers have been advertising onlyfans to children for years now how is this different
it s a moistcri1tical classic https://i.redd.it/jgmhejyx6s091.png)
i know it s a joke but i always find it funny that now people get angry at someone for having like mild opinions on things
i think the big issue is the initial reactions and how hard people went after kick versus qt and twitch anyone with a brain knows you don t advertise sexual shit to minors and what did it take for everyone to do a double take a giant roast from a funny youtuber girl these people should have called this shit out the second it hit and i m disappointed in some of my favorite streamers for waiting this long to even voice something about it
this lsf comment just blew my mind and made me say wow what a searing hot take out loud
would it really even be a topic of somebody didn t clip it and post it here no it would just be another thing he said on stream instead of some discussion
does charlie even have the ability to produce a take that he knows is unpopular he very clearly tries his best to not have controversial takes
his channel in a nutshell
a lot of countries have regulation for advertising to children and in some advertising to children under a certain age is banned
a car is innocent till you see someone sign a 60k loan at interest
having a child is a nightmare i watch parents take their kids to the store and they purposely set shit up to catch childrens eye then they start begging for it in the store now you either have a disciplined child you tell them no or shitty parents start fighting with their kids its malicious and always has been
there s maybe some good arguments for that but i feel like widening the conversation robs us of the severity gradient what i mean by that is porn ads have bigger impact on kids than car ads perhaps you agree with this as well not trying to attack you or anything like that just pointing things out
how was this an example of marketing towards kids though qt doesn t cater specifically to a family friendly audience nor was the streamer awards aimed at kids directly if underaged persons want to lie about their age on porn sites that s on them imo
she got that back by doing podcasts within like hours she did her podcast exclusively on patreon that night then the fear podcast the next morning she said it herself if minx ruined her party she might as well expose minx and farm the drama to get the money back
actually qts org paid for that

why would you want to skip this lol
that boss is pretty annoying ngl
definitely scripted source trust me bro
who
that mf had flash bound to mouse
blew my mind when i found out you can kill ramon with two golden eggs in the remake
the whole game is just like chefs kiss game design you start out asking why leon controls like a weird tank you make some crazy mistakes through the game and fight through them anyway there s something freeing in how it breaks the mold then builds an extremely well tuned game around that it s hard to explain but when you play it it s just different enough that everything feels good and making mistakes and winning in spite of them doesn t feel unfair it feels like overcoming adversity
that s planned to take all the huns out she didn t miss i think mulan shot it
woah a livestreamfail look at that
until you reload
someone tell this guy about loading your last save
should ve saved it for resident evil remake lule
i mean the rwda
he waited just to do you dirty like that f edit realising you probably mean you actually hit him cause he took longer in which case gg
i don t trust you _
cares
you don t need two you can one shot it if you hit the weak spot if you just throw it at the outside it will only do like 3rd
the movement itself always felt like a mechanic rather than a limitation even though it obviously was a limitation but the game was so greatly balanced around the control of leon along with the tools at his disposal that it all just ends up working perfectly you really go throughout an entire training arc from beginning to end as you turn more and more proficient with the tanked controls until you actually become the meaning of a tank itself with healing herbs stacked in your inventory and a multitude of weapons and grenades to use against the ganados as you rambo yourself through whatever the game throws at you obviously i wasn t actually able to rambo myself through my first playthroughs especially the hardcore one back in the original but my third playthrough really gave me the ability to finesse the game by just pure hours of experience alone playing mercenaries back then with tank controls also really helped at that mercenaries is a fucking nightmare gamemode with how challenging it is lol
thanks for explaining the joke of a year old movie everyone has seen now
lol that would be a good topic for a subreddit
yeah i was referring to saving the rpg to the last boss ahahah but i wish i had used it on the ramon fight i died like times over there and i always was running out of bullets
who
in hardcore and professional the first gold egg won t kill him even if you hit his weak spot takes another gold egg or like magnum rounds to kill him while he is stunned
nah it would never work people just want parasocial drama
asked
is there anything in the game that hints that you can do this or is it just some random thing they included
there s a side quest to toss something at his portrait then you find a bunch of chickens in the room with said portrait
the golden egg is an insta kill to most things and regular players can figure this out just by throwing them at regular enemies but you can save it to use it on a boss for big damage it s not a special unique interaction or anything and yes as the other commenter mentioned there s a slight clue when you re told to throw an egg doesn t have to be golden at his portrait

w to every streamer that doesnt buy a scottish fold
zoil s a fucking giant so that could be a full grown tiger
that cat will look like ron perlman in a few months
such a cute cat it s nice seeing mixes as compared to la streamers who have aria s backyard breeder scottish fold cats which is a breed plagued by health problems due to poor breeding those squished face cats are always so sad
zoil isn t gonna need a cat tree because worbo can just chill on his shoulders to have the highest perched view in the room
what a dope mix of breeds those are like the two cats i wanna get once me and my gf get a house maybe a ragamuffin instead of a ragdoll but same difference
yo i had a ragdoll cat back around best cat i ve ever had
ragdoll the best
orange cats are so stupid and affectionate best cats
ragdolls are the best cats
thats a happy cat
kitty
what you don t realise is because zoil is so huge that cat is already the size of a horse
that s a happy kitty
cute but ragdolls are selectively bred to be expensive which can promote shitty breeders hope he got his from a good place that its not a deformed breed though
so cute i have a main coon as well goodluck vacuuming every few days
big cat for a big man
ayo what he say the cat was

i keep forgetting about huge zoil is that kitten is already decent size maine coon s get pretty large rag doll by shrink it a tad bit
holy shit maine coon is a really big cat i thought i ve seen everything with the huge rabbits
cat has a v8 inside crazy idle
scottish folds are so unethical it makes me sick how popular the breed has become and it seems to be a favourite amongst streamers at the same time maine coons aren t exactly a healthy breed either
practically folds are p preem for a streamer to be fair breed just eats and sleeps p much surprised to see one get a maine coon with how high energy maintenance they are usually like savannahs minus the mood lmao
i was thinking awh what a cute little kitty then i remembered how big zoil was that s already a big cat
my sister has two main coon rag doll mixes they are huge only a year old and already about the size of most other races
fuslies munchkin or whatever they are called are straight up animal abuse
where i live it s illegal to breed or sell scottish fold cats since based decision by my stupid government
honestly lost some respect for ludwig when he got that new cat
my parents bought a baby pug when i was about and i will always love her to death but man it was horrible seeing her move around after a few years gasping for air to the point it sounded like she was going to just fall over and die because of the scrunched face
are you saying humans with health issues should stop breeding too
wait yeah if that kitten s the length of his forearm it s already gotta be pushing like a foot and a half
breeds not races lol
apparently she almost killed one of them by running over them with her chair i bet that cat was punching the air to be freed
aria not fixing her cat and it having multiple accidental litters was pure negligence then she charges 2k for the accidental kittens she lives in an apartment it s one thing to not get it fixed but then you need to be extra careful how is the cat getting bred i doubt she did any genetic testing like for joint issues either before the breeding i used to think she was really cool but the fact she never got called out for being such an irresponsible pet owner drove me insane and then everyone was fawning over the new cat
seeing how wubby handled criticism towards his decision in cat was frustrating as well especially when in the past he acknowledged pugs being an unethical breed
i dont get the appeal of that cat legit looks weird with its fucked up ears i am guessing its supposed to look like a cartoon cat almost thats the appeal
in general i instantly think less of people the moment i learn they buy a pet from a breeder if it s some pure bred with weird ears faces etc i start judging them as not actually caring about the animal as a living thing they see it as an object or an accessory
ye
if you got life threatening genetic health problems that will be passed to offspring it would be a dick move to have said offspring
whoops forgot the specific word in english used to saying raza race in spanish
this is insane paying 2k and not even getting dna combo tests and the basics i get people don t like breeders but this is the same amount of effort that someone selling pets on facebook for puts in and you know if they aren t altering their own pets that the kittens aren t getting altered before they re sold
i mean have you seen her twitter that girl has like five meltdowns a week about the most mundane shit i don t know how anyone would expect her to be responsible with anything
who knows people willingly own pugs and french bulldogs of all hideous things
people are fucked in the head look at what a bull terrier looks like now and then from the s
deleted
i figured it was something like that just sounds concerning in english lol
pugs and french bulldogs are cute as fuck bro i m personally not a fan cause they re basically bred with breathing problems but there s a reason they still exist
they re grotesque inbred hapsburg abominations imo but people will find anything cute so yeah
