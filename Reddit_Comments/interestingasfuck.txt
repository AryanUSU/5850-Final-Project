it will be excellent to see non iaf posts culled too many mediocre posts
no text on images gifs videos fuckin thank you
laying down the rules and enforcing them are very different things if these were actually enforced it would be interestingasfuck
isn t a ban for each rule too much i mean just remove the post also considering the number of mods in this sub handling ban appeals would be difficult too if you ban the user for almost every single rule
what a thorough yet highly threatening set of rules i d actually be afraid to post anything for fear of breaking a commandment and getting banned i m probably committing some kind of offense just by posting this comment why would anyone post under such conditions
can something be done about the facebook style sourceless wild fact posts that frequently are immediately debunked by mild research in the comments
i have decent karma but cant post what s the minimum
what about posts related to products the poster is selling i keep seeing posts on here of things op makes and then links people to their profile i truly feel like this is not very tasteful and should not be allowed
why can i only upvote but not downvote
can we add a rule of no 3d renders concept art unless done for the artistic value concept art for an item or product is not of any inherent value to me every year there s about new designs for a car tire that some university student makes for a project that end up on here and nowhere else
if has become soooooo boring with all this copycat posting
why am i seeing so many satirical posts
that s a little subjective specifically rule one
not really related but can someone explain what the subreddit icon is
is conversation encouraged i ve just been told that the golden rule is to not reply to my own posts can someone please clarify the official position of the subreddit
dumb question from a noob how do i find the top posts edit nevermind found it
if you have questions feel free to ask in the comments however this is not a place to debate the rules
removed
would it be possible to add no death videos i really like the content of iaf but recently there have been several assassination posts that are more disturbing than interesting

does the be civil rule include posting things that are likely to elicit an uncivil response such as political content and other traditional flamebait topics there are certain topics that will go nuclear in the comments section even if the question itself is crafted to be civil or neutral
can i post photo i took of something my picture was removed from the pics subreddit said it was a screenshot and blurred text even though i did it for privacy reasons

nice name btw
trying to
removing the post and telling users what they did wrong that way doesn t seem to have the same effect as a temp ban people have been much more likely to not make the same mistake twice after a temp ban frankly most of the time when i look at an account they ve made multiple rule breaking posts that have been removed some of these rules are very straight forward and ignoring them shows that they clearly haven t taken the time to bother to read the rules or even browse the surbeddit
the simplest rules to follow carry the penalty it s not hard to not post a social media screenshot
do you have one in particular that you re talking about
not public info
can you link to an example
people like to think they re funny they re not report them and they ll get removed
i know that s why i said it s purely subjective and it s why people don t get banned unless they post something that clearly didn t belong

hi here i clicked on the auto response on my post https://reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij2aes/_/g3ap1t8/?context=1 on reading the rules it took me to a post about votes is the link wrong
i ve been trying to make a post for a month now probably tried to post it about times this account is like months old so it s not new and i have about karma now which seems like a reasonable amount what gives why can t i make a post
the link goes to https://reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/about/why_is_it_that_when_you_downvote_your_own_post_it/
what s the subreddit icon
is making a cursed comment considered punishable by ban assuming that it s not openly harmful to other parties
minor typo this rules
are quote posts allowed here as well if not i won t post them anymore
report any comment you see with spam links
i haven t noticed a lot of them and i really doubt something that specific needs to be put into the rules if it s more dustrubing than interesting they get removed

use an external gif hosting site like imgur gfycat or w e
most of those are already not interesting as fuck do you have examples of them
link them here without context it s hard to say where they could go in most cases there are just better ways to share things than a twitter thread
probably not

dick just passed away on prior to this they did a technique called the scissor kick and they landed on sand was the first year he did the flop and the first year they used foam pits to land on
this technique could not have been used much earlier because the landing area was a sand bed and there would have been a lot of broken necks it only became safe to do it after the implementation of the big bag of foam blocks
unfortunately it was a flop
a lot of people don t know that this technique was called the fosbury flop which was a huge coincidence because this guy s last name was also fosbury
fosbury just passed away on march 12th and espn and fox sports completely ignored it espn com never referenced his death once and never wrote a story about this innovator he took one of the most basic athletic events that humans can do and completely revolutionized it after or thousand years of people doing it wrong and he s completely forgotten by the modern sports media
how did people high jump before this
valery brumel was the last of the scissor jumpers fosbury s flop caused some controversy but everyone after him used his style records were shattered
so graceful
i can t think of another development in any sport as instantly revolutionary as fosbury s flop
isn t this the technique shown in avicii s broken arrows clip
my dad knew dick back in the s here in oregon dick attended a dinner party at our home when i was years old my dad asked him to bring his gold medal to show the kids he did and i ll never forget it thank you dick fosbury
my favourite part of this story is it was revealed during a major meet so the rules couldn t be changed to prevent it it became legal and always will be long jump would have their fosbury moment except the somersault jump was debuted at a smaller meet which meant a rule stating the feet must stay above the head was added in time to prevent it s adoption
olympic games were epic i was only but can remember the fosbury flop bob beamon jumping feet tommie smith and john carlos black power salute
fun fact this technique let s you jump over the bar without ever actually bringing your center of mass over the bar
it was a dick move
good gravy that is a long stride
foul no two fouls look dickie people can t go flying in the air like that
not a world record fosbury cleared 24m on his third attempt which won him the gold and was an or he then asked the bar bar to be raised to 29m one cm more than the world record at the time he missed all three attempts at 29m
the fosbury flop at least that s what they called it when they taught it to me in high school
it is like the alley oop moment
fosbury flop
really incredible high jump wow
flopping brilliant
my dad was a high jumper and got to meet him in the 70s when my dad jumped his high school and college were still jumping into sawdust that was ground level in a pit he was the only one in his league that used the flop while a lot of his buddies were using the western roll
i never knew he was a left footed jumper
not for anything if he was dunking a basketball he literally took off from the foul line some height as well as distance
it s beautiful to watch what an athlete
the fosbury sloop
he made that look easy
dick fosbury i hardly know her
that s how i get into bed
i saw a youtube video the other day on the history of high jump and it was done quite well worth checking out
legend
these fosburries taste like fosburries
imagine being the guy before him lol well fuck i didn t know we could do that
did high jump in school scissor kick the low heights dick flip above that
the crazy thing is my senior year of high school the kid that won state jumped inches lower than this world record in the rain we always gave props to dick flopper
looks easy doesn t it not clipping the bar with your heels is not easy
his technique later coined the dick flop
go beavs
the fosbury flop rip to this literal game changer
i m no athlete but is he the one who invented the back jump flip for the olympics
how you gonna not post the old technique as well
ah the dick flop
a great demonstration of the brill bend debbie did it first
pretty sure i ve heard they would try and just jump over it head first on a podcast
awesome post
what s up with the title unless i am remembering wrong fosbury on get the olympic record not the world record
boing
i was looking at the initial momentum of his jump and its too short and condensed
they should make a rule where you have to land on your feet
i love how wildly unathletic people looked before they invented weight lifting and nutrition
it amazes me that the first thing people didnt do was to see the best way to do it
i wanna be the flag waver checks out
people there look really unimpressed
changed the game
at first they called this technique the dick move then the dick flop finally they settled on the fosbury flop
they named the technique after him it became the standard and is used to this day i did it in high school in the 70s
this achievement is so under appreciated that i only knew about it from an avicii music video
the good ole fosbury flop high jump was fun in high school and college but at i m already humbled with chronic lower back pain
my dad told me about this it revolutionized high jump it s called the fosworthy flop to this very day i believe
what a dick
very smooth
this whole time i thought it was the frisbee flop
floppy dick
don t lose track of the roll run parallel to the bar extend one leg straight the other tucked and roll over the bar less effective than the flop but cool
i use to high jump on high school and i d love to try again to see how i compare now it was hella fun
gracefully powerful
i m glad they went with fosbury flop and not dick flop
what a dick move
go beavs
go beavs
this is how world war ended
fun fact the technique he use was running up to the jump
isn t this like the best technique in modern track
with ease too
who has a higher vertical ja morant or this guy
dude cleared that thing by like six inches imagine having to compete against that
damn that is a small pit
can you imagine how absolutely cool that shot would be him sideways in the air like that with a camera made with modern technology omg
i don t know that anyone ever did anything more to revolutionize their sport more than he did just look how f n smooth was tip of the cat to someone who is pretty underrated when we talking about influential athletes
sun valley newspapers had some nice articles about his legacy and commitment to the communities
what s the technique exactly
why do people insist on describing other people doing things as casually as if they have any clue at all how much effort the person put into the feat
they should have used his first instead of last name when they named the fosbury flop after him
this is why you can never be afraid to fail or flop in his case great success can be born from failure
funny thing is i am not a huge sports person but i know about the fosbury flop i can t think of another sports technique that i could name like that he changed the sport forever
a truly amazing person rip
go beavs
it is like when jackie moon threw the first alley oop
technique technique technique technique technique
wasn t that normal i thought people always jumped like that for that sport
tracktown usa legend rip
rip to a kind idahoan
he cleared that by inches
the fosbury flop
go beavs rip fosbury
imagine doing the flop into hard packed sand when everyone was scissor kicking i m glad they finally switched to a big cushy pad
a true innovator

i m curious as to why though like what made that many scorpions want to be there is there water or lots of bugs or something
if the scorpions live there is it really abandoned
looks like it s their house now
saw something about people harvesting them farming and trying to sell the poison as it s incredibly pricey used in pharmaceutical market for cancer and other research this looks like a scorpion version of a meth den
i read once that this was a breeding place and intentional not abandoned or random
nope to the nope
i only counted challenge me
when life gives you scorpions you make scropionade get to the milkin boi
sub zero is ffffuuuuuuuccccckkkkkeeeddddd
you here about the scorgy at dave s gonna be crazy
this looks like it belongs in an indiana jones movie
get over here more like get out of there
hold on what is their food source
send him back at night with a black light this would be a must see with them glowing green
in the words of the great randy jackson it s a no from me dawg
the boo box
scorpion king just passing through
scorpions why did it have to be scorpions indiana jones
you bitch you haven t thought of the smell
would be jackpot for someone selling fried scorpion on a stick
this is what happens when you defund planned parenthood
he has wild wasteland equipped now imagine the crunching while u walk over them
i was stung by a scorpion once i could actually feel the venom moving from my finger tip up my arm my son was an infant who was still nursing i asked the doctor if i could still nurse him or if there was a danger of the venom being passed into my breast milk my doctor didn t know and he called the poison control center they said not to worry the venom could pass into the breast milk but it is a protein so he would just digest it we later told him that was why he glowed st night in his sleep
i would abandon that house too
kerosene time
burn it down
looks like it s not abandoned
burn that shit down
how
what in the actual fuck when did nightmares start turning real
can you smel el el el el el el el el el el what the rock is cooking
fuck no
what are they eating how do so many survive
why how what are they all eating i wonder
fallout music intensifies
it s a scorpion partee
what do they eat
bomb
what are they eating
that house is technically not abandoned i d consider it extremely inhabited
he needs fire a lot of fire
r ithadtobebrazil
it s not abandoned if there are thousands of scorpions living there
that s enough internet for today
this makes no sense the amount of bugs it would take daily to sustain this colony there s no way
fire
just burn the house down at that point
nope nope nope burn the house actually you know the last of of us scene with the lady doctor it s too late just bomb it
not a cellphone in sight just living in the moment
if it s in california it s only 750k
and here i always thought the house of the scorpion was just a really good book
que the burn it down jokes
this is where they are respawned they just found the worlds supply of scorpions this seems like a very lucrative situation for a scorpion farmer
if it was seattle it would still go for half a million
fire
who abandons their babies like that
nope
i m so hungry
everybody has to be somewhere
nope
time to dive in like scrooge mcduck and his money pit
i ve found a prime candidate for arson
like a traditional medicine farm
in certain cases tactical nuclear weaponry is acceptable
i wonder why they abandoned scorpion cottage
how much did they have to pay the crazy person who walked towards a house full of scorpions to film this
r nightmarefuel
they can have it
a ready fortune for scorpian venom harvesting
fire and lots of it
fire is the right answer
if that was me the title would say man breaks land speed record while running away from house of scorpions
this was a scorpion farm on an earlier post
hanz get ze flamenwafer
what do they even eat can t be enough food for that mass
who ever is brave enough to clear the house gets to keep it free of charge
welp gasoline and match s do the trick
this is one of the rare times where burn it down is an actual good option
time to leave this life i guess
you win this round nature
hmm brazilian portuguese i am surprised but i m not surprised r ithadtobebrazil
it s so weird that i don t feel bothered watching this at all but if they were spiders i would literally feel them crawling all over my skin and be terrified the animals are so similar yet the scorpions i do not mind
not really abandoned is it
intrusive thoughts jumps
what do they even eat to stay alive wheres so much food come from for them
i wonder how much xp you could get from torching that house
they should use this room to punish criminals throw em inside and walk away
can someone please explain this
hell nah to the nah nah nah
it s not abandoned thousands of scorpions live there
nuke it from space
man commits arson for the greater good
whole house has to be cleansed with fire
what they all eat each other
i don t think it s abandoned i think that s just their house now
i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit it s the only way to be sure
hey my name s steve o and this is scorpion houuuse
this was posted already and it was said it was a scorpion farm
probably scorpion venom farm gallon is million

i m pretty sure one of those turtles is upside down quite ironic for a turtle saving tunnel
more like to protect the train from the blue turtle shells
poor guy gets his minutes of fame and is flipped over on his back in the picture
looks more like a turtle trap with the ends being closed off
i like turtles
seems kind of like playing god as trains are turtles natural predator
yep the road behind stanford university has salamander tunnels
is japan like swarming with turtles i think it s cool but how many turtles have to be around before this becomes a thing now i want to go there even more so i can give them back scratches they should put bits of cut up broom heads there stuck to the top angled in so the turtles can stop and have a scratch
my biggest takeaway is japan s infamous and much applauded train network includes the cost of building a turtle tunnel and is still magnitudes cheaper than when we try to build trains in the us
i was riding in a car with my elderly mother one day on a busy local road where traffic goes mph when we saw a turtle motionless between the two lanes on our side of the road traffic whizzing past at oh no we have to save the turtle she said she immediately pulled over into an apartment complex and urged me a near year old guy to go play in traffic with the turtle i said to her i ll save it if it s a regular turtle i m not messing with any snappers so i walked out into the highway and sure enough it s a snapper fuck that i said and walked back to the car but she had the trunk open looking for any kind of implement to help she handed me a stick and a inch deep cardboard box top from a box of paper and motioned me back out to the highway i love my mother and i will go to absurd lengths to make her happy but i could tell this was already well out of hand i waited for a break in traffic and approached the turtle again i offered him the stick to bite on put it up against his mouth he wasn t interested so i used the stick to push him into the box he really didn t like that as i was holding the box with one hand he continually turned and tried to bite the hand i had to constantly rotate the box to keep him from biting me and he could turn around really fast i struggled to walk and turn the box at the same time but one of my shoes caught on the pavement and i went down hard in the oncoming lane of traffic in front of god and everybody at this point i looked up and saw a truck braking in front of me then i saw that my mother had stopped five lanes of traffic in both directions to protect me and the turtle this was the moment my soul left my body but life went on i couldn t manage to grab the box again because the snapper was charging relentlessly so i put the stick in one corner and dragged the box about a foot and again and again and again foot by foot i dragged that fucking box slowly across the highway to the edge where there was a luxurious oasis of trees and creek and undergrowth waiting just down the hill from the highway just as i got there i tipped over the box sending the snapper head over arse down the hill to the verdant foliage below and then i fell over onto the ground and watched the traffic start back up my humiliation complete i hope that fucker made it to the turtle party and got laid i did everything to make it happen
thanks i love it
did they also make turtle crossing signs so they know where to cross
america can barely keep train tracks passable for trains let alone wildlife
so once i found a turtle stuck between the two rails of a train track i ll save you turtle i think so i stop my car get out grab the turtle then well fuck which way was it wanting to go on one side was a road but further on a lake that road s no good but on the other side a long stretch of parking lots and businesses with not much in way of a goal dry and barren but safer i think i choose lake side hope it made it
that s the kind of stuff we need here
if it were dolphins though then they d just tie them to the tracks
awesome as the proud parent of two year old turtles this warms my heart
herds them into giant pot of boiling water soups on
annnd potential derailments
deleted
not all heroes wear capes
cool instead of the turtle being instantly smashed to death it can now fall in a hole where it will starve and die of thirst upside down while other turtles crawl over it for a few days
r mademesmile r aww r wholesome
but the japanese people eat turtles how ironic
deleted
it would be cool if it were bigger to easily stop suicidal people
anyone who thinks the japanese care about animals should look up dolphin drive hunting
save the turtles
and the tunnels lead to a box where they re sold for soup
and that would require them to hire someone to clean them hope they can maintain them well
dead end though
why s the end closed seems like a turtle catcher
humanity restored
that is not what this is at all it is a cable conduit that doesn t have the top on it
just wondering how the fuck they will get out of the tunnel
traffic is getting pretty backed up in the turtle tunnel looks like we got a roll over this might take awhile to get cleaned up
turtle trap
they just fear the revenge of the turtles with godzilla
it takes them directly to the soup pot
ron desantis points and scowls woke
save the wee turtles save the wee turtles
most wholesome thing i ve seen all day
we do this in california for tiger salamanders
i like turtles i never had a problem with them they re cool and quiet never heard of a turtle starting an uproar be kind to turtles
i like turtles
we have got to be more like japan with inventions like this to preserve our wildlife and our forests and trees please
only if they could take care of oldies instead of turtles
the upsidedown turtle bothers me
tutel
probably a trainspotting turtle waiting for the next train to pass over
also the tunnel leads to a brick idk how convenient that is for turtles
even better since the tracks don t get used trains wipe the rust off the tracks pretty quickly
that awful walk home from a bar in the morning sunlight only to pass out still drunk in the middle of the road there s gonna be a family of turtles walking past soon and the mom turtle will be like don t look kids just keep your eyes down we ll grab an ice cream before we get home if you re good
no way this wasn t set up look at the curb on the right near the boot oh yeah turtle heaven i call bs
it must have turned upside down by the suction of the train passing over it
his little buddy will help flip em over all good
traffic jam
well yeah you have to leave it you don t wanna interfere with nature
you re a japanese rail worker walking along the train tracks suddenly you come upon a tortoise lying upside down on the tracks baking in the sun the tortoise will die if left like that why did you let the tortoise die
well only the first place trains
yeah it seems like a place for turtles to go to die instead of possibly damaging the rail by being crushed on it
the walkway is under the rails
or designed to herd them away from whatever is on that side why do you know this if we can only see one end
trains are man made
lil bro probably thinks you re his guardian angel
damn that was funny he was probably cursing the weird foot soft shelled weirdo that decided to attack it on a pleseant sunday stroll if it is any consolation he will with some luck out live you i for one as a friend of our fellow chelonian cousins thank you for saving him at cost to your nerves and honour
is it messed up to use a turtle shell as a bowl to serve turtle soup because i can see that being a thing
psh no a turtle will just go crunch if run over by a train
a topic of turtles and trains and you shove in some us bullshit we get it
norwegians hunt eat more whales than the japanese we eat tons of pigs and cows does that mean no one can care about animals what s your point
notice the end of the turtle tunnel is enclosed
why was this your first thought when looking at this post
mass genocide
the guys who were working with fucking nazis are you fucking stupid
we kill tons of pigs and cows and norwegians whale more than the japanese does that mean nobody in the west can care about animals
we got turtles deadass doin heroin out here
i was thinking they can t get out it s a turtle suicide pit
turtle soup tunnel
it s where they collect them for the soup
bullet trains are immune
a turtle wouldn t damage a rail by being crushed on it i m assuming it ll be one small area that gets checked regularly enough by a worker it s japan we re talking about
a turtle wouldn t damage the rail as a kid i would go with my dad and stack coins on the railroad track when the train runs them over they turn into a flat blob of copper it was pretty cool

you got kenm d
prove it
the train that ran on your mom was definitely made of men
people do that lol
going by comments a lot of people wasn t seen a train
i found a turtle on a rail one day and i had to either pick him up or run his turtle ass over with a locomotive i didn t want to see that yuck i was later told it was a snapping turtle also not sure how true that is but i m lucky i didn t get bit
they re designed to allow them to climb out
leave leonardo alone living in a sewers gets to you
in a month itll be a ww1 trench of dead turtles
no those are just the stoner turtles who eat pizza all day

they re literally trolling us at this point
yeaaah germany cosplaying stormtroopers is not a great look lol
oopsiedaisy
i have a very bad feeling about this
when britain introduces their space force it better be with space marines from 40k edit it also tracks theyd chose those guys
people laugh at the idea of the space force but it does serve a purpose it alleviates the air force from having to keep tract of all the stuff in space is its the natural progression of the military just like how the air force came out of the army
die kommentarsektion ist nun eigentum imperialen brd
hans get ze dethnstar
having lived in germany for years this is proof that germans have a sense of humor
they aren t exactly taking it very seriously
germany should probably avoid anything with the name stormtrooper in it
do we have to give nasa back
i kinda love this
they re just suckers for a uniform
smh these comments
this is just fucking brilliant and hilarious at the same time
this shit has layers
so they identify with the empire
great stormtroopers in germany again
no germany not again
fuckin awesome based german space force announcement takes the lead for the meme wars
its ironic that the galactic empire was based off nazi germany
bold move considering the empire was based off the nazis
no one told me the 4th reich was gonna be the galactic empire
this feels illegal
stormtroopers in germany you say
preferred the old kind of stormtroopers these ones seems like their trying to hard for an elite status
oh look at the cute americans in the thread joking about how we don t know what exactly we re picturing here how adorable they are we know be warned
too soon
a dark evil force that used it s stormtroopers to devastating effect over countless conflicts and utilised it s technological superiority to silence it s foes and some guys dressing up as starwars characters
a very happy cosplay party isn t it
r empiredidnothingwrong
nice
very fitting considering the design inspiration of those helmets
hmmm german stormtroopers i see absolutely no problems here
kraustarefuckingmental
a someone very important somewhere up the chain has not seen the movie about space nazis or b dgaf
no no no you are still on time out get back to your corner germany
that one storm trooper in the middle is an absolute unit
yes we are nazis again but with shiny new outfits so we re cool right
kinda awkward considering the empire is basically space nazis
so the german government is using stormtroopers history repeats itself
and were sure this isn t an april fools prank or euro disney
it s own version of the us space force lol is the luftwaffe now germany s version of the us air force or the marine germany s own version of a us navy
space command of the federal defense
disney is calling their lawyers rn
i prefer the chest lasers from moonraker
awesome
germi knows how to have fun
that one storm trooper is a unit
why have i never heard of this why wasn t this in the news is this a joke
that s quite tasteful coming out of germany
heil vader i guess
haha the red guy on the right didn t get the memo about nobody recognizing the recent sequels
who wants to start a rebel force
american culture is so pervasive yee haw
well their blasters were modeled on german firearms so i suppose this is the natural progression of things
bout damn time things gonna get more interesting now
guy on the left looks a little short for a stormtrooper
this has to be fake i hope it isn t
par for the course
pst heeyyyy pst nooo
life imitates art imitates life imitates art imitates life imitates art imitates life imitates art imitates life imitates art imitates
isn t the one in the middle a little tall for a stormtrooper
are we the baddies
guy on the left is a little short for a stormtrooper
that one guy seems a little tall to be a storm trooper suspicious
it s pretty fitting due to the various things lucas lifted from germany for star wars
were the stormtroopers based on the old ss
germany announced their space force by dressing up as the most iconic space nazis ever conceived tell me this is a joke tell me i m being trolled
oh no it has started the 4th reich i knew those bastards were planning something
german space empire huh what could possibly go wrong
you know who once had literal stormtroopers germany
ahhh germany s brining back the stormtroopers poland better watch out
i see they invited the u s republican party to pose for the inauguration photo
oh no oh no oh no hitler taking off the mask for a second oh yeah https://giphy.com/gifs/snl-saturday-night-live-season-44-zx0bgephievlavebnq)
since the comments seem to be mostly useless for explaining this i found an article https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-army-darth-vader-space-command/ the space command did not immediately respond to a request for comment but a video of the full event says the stormtroopers were there to raise funds for an army affiliated charity
empire did nothing wrong
i gotta wonder if germans feel weird cosplaying as imperial officers
that ll happen when you do star wars instead star trek even if you find affordable republic costumes hardly anyone will notice who they are with star trek uniforms you just grab some colored t shirts and pins and everyone knows what s that so you end up looking silly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzsxn4hnrnw)
stormtrooper sturmsoldat really
it only makes sense round is in space too bad there s no poland in space thoo
and people say germans aren t funny this is great
please tell me this was a government level april fools joke
we have to make the stormtrooper armor the official space force uniform
why does everyone cosplay as stormtroopers clone troopers were way better than storm troopers
those are members of the german garrison 501st legion a star wars costume club we were invited to that opening event as an opening act according to guus that were there they often get invited to this kind of stuff
maybe dressing like space nazis isn t the best way to celebrate the start of the german space force
kinda messed up of germany considering the empire is literally based on the nazi regime
somehow the space nazis returned
bold of them to use stormtroopers again
that s actually cool and also very fitting
i have so many questions but the biggest one is what s with the guy on the far right with the eagle banner is that a real thing in the bundeswehr this all feels way too allegorically related to you know what for modern germany
the imperial march starts playing
oh no i can see germany s humor here but oh no the world doesn t need to see germany looking out to be siding with the the empire and the dark side
everyone s talking about germany and stormtroopers yet the real threat is going unnoticed the lawyers at disney are currently looking like the orcs about to storm helms deep

free hand slop im in
if this isn t proof that hunger is the best chef i don t know what is
obviously if we were brought up in this culture this wouldnt be as jarring but woof
there s so many feet
if you were wealthy enough to just air deliver food and reasonably useful equipment to villages do you think it would vastly improve their lives or just create more problems
there is no spoon
take a moment to be grateful for whatever you have to eat today
damn you can t be taking what you have for granted this is the reality for a lot of people that can t afford food
interesting way to empty the porta john hopper
in this culture it is normal to eat and serve food with the right hand
appetizing
looks like they just added water to the dirt on the ground then recycled it right back onto a ground tortilla
motherfuckers got cell phones and not one damn fucking serving utensil
the fourth guy got an extra surprise dead bird or mouse extra protein either way
removed
can i get a ladle
why this way
what a kind heart
cholera speed run
makes me so happy to not live there
my germs
mmm diarrhea
strong immune systems were built that day
gotta love liquid manure yummm
upside is it s going to look the same coming out
you get mud you get mud everybody gets free mud
why is this man scooping wet concrete on to peoples rice
life insurers hate this one trick
this is lovely but please bro i m begging you use a spoon
nope
why not keep the food in one place and make the people walk past with their plates that guy almost got sand on his meal and the people serving it might trip and lose the whole meal on the ground
mom can we stop at mcdonald s no we have food at home the food at home
mcdonald s don t sound too bad now huh chad chad was my old boss that said mcdonald s is disgusting and the meat was pink slime
ah yes hand slop can t wait for seconds
doing the lords work
some people just don t have anything to eat guys nothing like ordering food to your home
what is this music hardcore bangledash rap awesome of him to give them food
can i get extra dirt from your feet on my goyslop please
excuse me there is a fingernail in my slop chef i made them extra sloppy for you
free mud pies
so they ve heard of cell phones but not spoons
yeah food
damn that s wild makes me grateful for the shit i take for granted everyday can t know how these dudes feel about life maybe they are real happy but feel bad the cook don t have a fucking ladle or some shit
it s crazy and sad people still live like this while a a half dozen guys half billion dollars
the food is free but the key to the single bathroom is
i m happy that they are getting food and it also make me appreciate what i have
there must be a reason he s scooping with his hands it s not like they literally don t have a single scoop an entire village
that looks like mud but when you don t have the luxury of choice anything s better than starving
probably the saddest thing i ve seen in a while also the most respectable
holy shit i got it good
is a spoon really that hard to find
and here s some diarrhea for you and you and you
poo poo platter
i guess that s lentil
show this to anyone thinking the us is a hard place to live
makes me sad born in the usa i often bitch and complain about all the crap going on i instantly feel blessed and so grateful i have a home electricity and shoes can you imagine never wearing shoes
i m sure it s delicious but i ll pass
mmmmmmmm guano
the food and the ground look the same
gastroenteritis yes please
if you were starving that shit would look divine
i got diarrhea just from watching this video
hey cement and rice is a delicacy in bangladesh
why are they so nasty
looks like saag mostly spinach in a cream sauce it s fukkin delicious
kinda like my favorite food when i lived in ethiopia you favorite is free and you next favorite is hot
if you rewind it slowly it looks like he s scooping up their food
they don t got food yall what makes you think they need ladles
more like humblingasfuck wow

can t whittle a damn spoon
jeepers they must be desperate
r wewantplates
man i m grateful to have been raised in my country kudos to these guys helping out this village though
i ve already eaten thank you
at least he s not serving it with his right hand
what is that cement on rice
i ll just have the rice
mf get a laddle
i m so happy i was born in the states
where did the phone come from
despite many of the comments i believe there s a few cultures that still eat with their hands even when there s cutlery available this can be seen in asian african and subcontinental groups was in singapore last week a truly modern city and visited little india at a restaurant an family of indian descent now living overseas all ate with their hands in this restaurant they were well dressed and appeared wealthy by their clothes accented english and demeanour there was cutlery on the table available
so many people dear jesus may i never complain about anything ever again forever
i serve the same the morning after i ve been on beer and pizza
i can afford to feed a whole town but i can t afford a ladle
and a handful of soup a handful of soup yes
just makes me humble
is this rice with mud
this is a reminder to be grateful for what you have these people are eating what looks like mud mixed with diarrhea on the ground delivered by some random dudes hands and they all look malnourished so they probably barely eat as it is thank fuck i don t live in that shithole now we should do our best to help these people and the rest of the world our of poverty
his back is going to be destroyed
no ladle but a smartphone to capture
my mans has a smart phone but is eatin like that
how else are you going to feed billions

part of my cognitive research institute worked with kea s while it s not implausible that food was a factor kea s are known to do things just for the simple sake of doing things it s manipulating and playing with the thing that s the reward in itself not necessarily the food they have no natural predators are extremely neophilic have a lot of motor diversity tend to get bored fast and are generally very explorative and curious when we visited the kea cage they d find fun things to do with us like biting our ankles why well because we d yell and that d amuse them they d eventually get bored of biting our ankles and start untying our shoelaces just so they could watch us tie our shoes only to go at it again then they d get bored of that and try to pick the buttons off our shirts remove our glasses and so on coming up with stuff to keep the little critters mentally occupied was one of the high priority topics for the kea lab https://haidlhof.org/forschung-2/). this is critically important for keas in captivity though because if they aren t mentally occupied enough they can develop stereotypical self harming behaviours this is often seen in kea s in zoos where the zoos do not have a good enough understanding of the cognitive abilities of these birds edit since this is getting attention in case any of you want to read more the kea lab here s a direct link to their uni page https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/cognition/kea-lab if you are interested in reading their studies here s a link to their publications https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/cognition/kea-lab/current-projects-and-publications
look at these glorious bastards https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/9112326315_667dbc3963_k.jpg).
ha i love how it tries different configurations like well that didn t work maybe this one over here and
can someone please get that bird some food and maybe a job
so did they feed them
so we just got domesticated
none shall pass without paying the toll
i just have to tell this story cause i never get a chance to and it haunts my dreams when i was i transferred to a university in nz and on one of our breaks a friend and i went backpacking around the south island one of our stops was milford sound where we booked a little cabin the bus drops us off at the cabins and being that it wasn t tourist season we were the only ones there and were immediately greeted by a curious kea hopping around at first we thought it was the cutest thing ever he followed us as we walked to the main building to check in but it was a long walk and slowly he started getting more aggressive screeching and flapping around so we pick up the pace and book it into the check in we get the keys and walk back outside and unsurprisingly the kea is just waiting for us but now it s _livid_ that we haven t fed it and it starts biting our ankles so we literally grab our bags and run to our cabin and this damn bird flies after us screaming like something out of a freaking horror movie we barely make it to our cabin unharmed and finally in the safety of the indoors so we thought we drop our bags and just stare at each other laughing like wtf just happened we walk around admiring the quaint little cabin i go to open the curtain covering the sliding glass door to the back porch and the kea is standing there staring at me i just about had a heart attack i shut the curtain so fast and literally never opened it again that was the last we saw of the evil bird thankfully but i spent the whole time in milford sound watching my back convinced it was just waiting to attack they re too smart and vicious for their own good
don t assume malice for what might just be a really smart animal playing tricks on you
there were several chains with links cm long or so piled up on a construction trailer i watched a kea start to pull the chain off the side of the trailer it kept pulling more links over the side until hanging links weighed enough that the chains pulled itself onto the ground making lot of noise in a linear fashion the kea proceeded to do the same for each remaining chain they re a lot of fun to watch as long as there is nothing they can destroy you have to watch your backpacks in the mountains with them you can stand next to the pack with keas a short distance away take a few steps away from the pack and the keas will immediately approach the pack and they will tear it to shreds if you give them enough time i really like them
saw a roadrunner once do something imaginative and bloodthirsty it ran up on my porch and stopped over a woolly bear caterpillar that was making its way across the concrete it cocked one eye at it for a second just like a dinosaur in a movie then it casually extended one talon and neatly incised it in half against the concrete it inspected the result for a moment then gobbled up each half individually and ran off
these little shits cost me bucks when it ate the door seal of the rental van i had very pretty and really friendly birds though
where s your safety vest bird
birds of a feather block together
the cutest cartel roadblock robbery ever
i am dumber than the kea i waited for a person to come out of the last car which stopped and set the cones before realizing that the video has ended
r dwarffortress intensifies
are they union members
clever girl
bit of a leap to assume the motivation surely
just so you know these fuckers will just break your car rip wing mirrors and windscreen wipers off just for fun they are awesome birds but can be absolute cunts haha
i left my hiking boots outside the tent one day to dry keas ate the toe out of one boot and the heel out of the other and put the boots back upright how they found them
gettin paid by the cone
the only alpine parrots i believe
we do a little trolling
moved them to get attention from humans in the hopes to get fed you just made that up what are you a bird psychologist i m from nz and saw this posted on reddit originally and trust me you made that up kea s are known trolls simple as
i think this is the tunnel back from milford sound i parked a rental here and amused myself whilst a kea attempted to disassemble various parts of the car
please tell me someone fed the bird
i miss my parrot more than i miss most humans
that little bastard was trying to set up a toll booth
dear humans stop stealing our habitat and ruining it with your shiny death boxes will do kea parrot stuff for food
how do they know that maybe he s just an asshole
seems about right for a parrot but i m leaning on it doing it for fun
a kea stole my anvil in dwarf fortress
the workers built a playground for the bird that is awesome
human food for good or bad is pretty tight animals have figured that hit out and want fresh home made meals
nah they are trying to get people to wreck so they can eat their delicious eyeballs parrots are evil man
are those the same ones that try to dismantle cars
let s block the road boys
what a cutie
so did they feed the bird
feed he
well did they feed him
wow they can establish a bird s motives through cctv pretty amazing tech
probably testing out a theory it had about manipulating where those giant mechanical box monsters went through on the road
in hopes to get fed or in hopes to hijack their car and murder them
get that parrot a job
in order to stop them doing this they got their own gym to play on https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/cheeky-kea-get-their-own-gym-in-bid-to-stop-them-messing-with-road-cones/lvcda4sfpz2ge3xzletskpntgu/)
that little shit was working on a full on traffic stop lmao
did it get fed talk about burying the lead
get this bird a meal
r birdsarentreal
the scientific consensus in new zealand is that a kea has around the same intelligence of a 3yr old nz child or a 6yr old australian

african grey parrots are smarter than kea
did someone feed it
smarter than crows
birds evolved from dinosaurs that s clearly an ambush x200b clever girl
just more proof r birdsarenotreal
somebody is seriously not giving that bird enough attention
so once he moved a cone a car stopped and fed him some nice bread and thats how he learned that cone food
if just a few animals like this bird and dolphins and maybe elephants had hands and opposable thumbs the human race would be over
it turns out a kea parrot considered the most intelligent bird in the world moved them to get attention from humans in the hopes to get fed separating fact from fiction in parentheses and baseless assumption the rest nbsp there is no single most intelligent species of bird
would be strange if an accident occurred because of it who is going to pay for damage s the bird
subhanaallah
did they find the parrot did they give him a home i have so many questions
they are always stealing my stuff in dwarf fortress
wow
why did i read this as the birds wanted to get attention from the feds aka police etc
i didn t realize they were the most intelligent bird in the world most mischievous that s obvious
somebody please give the bird some feed already
strong birdy those things are heavy
r animalsbeingjerks
how do they know the parrots intention was to get fed
i recognise that entrance this is the western end of homer tunnel truly a magical experience coming out and seeing all the different wildlife heading into milford sound
birds aren t real
did it work
the most intelligent bird in the world definitely more intelligent than a butt load of humans i ll tell ya that
dumb humans i can control them with these pointy things look at me i m the puppet master
although kea are not known to talk like some other parrots they re considered to be as smart as a four year old child and have intelligence similar to primates they are able to solve logic puzzles and enjoy a good challenge there is an extensive article on this little known critter https://www.firstlighttravel.com/blog/cheeky-kea#:\~:text=although%20kea%20are%20not%20known,and%20enjoy%20a%20good%20challenge.
i m the same
someone get this bird and his friends a nzta vest
ah the heralded feed me cones
armok approves
awww to bad it didn t work out this was quite clever
apparently they eat sheep
this sounds like me as a child
i want one
feed da birb
never been to nz but i thought the word on keas was that they would do stuff like this just to fuck with people s shit my bet is that they were hoping to cause a head on collisuion
i read this as kia parrot
not sure if on topic but why do old people like to keep birds in cages as pets
this suddenly became a r wholesome worthy post
my dad used to have an african grey and it would tease and taunt my mom just to piss her off when they were dating got married playing jokes calling her names impersonating others
elijah wood is already set to voice the character
i had an interaction with one at a queenstown zoo the little fucker was all cuddly like and turned and offered its neck to scratch which i though was really cool till the fucker turned at the last second and bit me vindictive little fucker used his cute wiles to encourage me in so it could attack me and it did it to many others so i wasn t an isolated case all morning i heard people scream from the direction of that bird as one after another fell victim to it
birds aren t real
this looks like the homer tunnel through the mountain on the road to milford sound there are tragic lights giving turns to each direction and the tunnel is about a kilometre long we got car jacked there by this same gang then when we stopped at the gertrude valley lookout and i watched a bloke sitting in his car with his door open get lured away from his car by a bird the kea took something out of the door pocket and ran under the car to the other side as the bloke ran around the car to try to get it the bird backtracked jumped inside his car and helped himself to an unopened packed of crisps from a bag of groceries on the back seat so now old mate was chasing the kea around the car park for the chips hilarious to watch
and how do we know it wasn t just curious by the colorful object lmao

bro that saber catch nearing the end
i came
hayden really put the work in nothing but respect for that guy s dedication to the role loved seeing this thanks for sharing
why the actual fuck was this not used
my opinion of hc just rose a few points
awhhh i would ve loved to see this version in the movie
this fight would have actually made more sense for dooku it would have showed how anakin actually had outpaced the then greatest swordsman in the galaxy and would have encapsulated years of off screen battles in one scene
i take back some of the bad things i ve said about hayden christiansen bro was in it to win it
source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxulxm7kngo)
okay i was a hayden haaaater after i watched this i have mega respect that shit was flawless
what shocking revelation does dooku tell anakin to get him mad i don t feel like watching an hour long video
hayden really delivered on that scene
so much passion from hayden sucks he got so much hate back in the day for someone who truly tried
count dooku literally looks like the father of my highschool girlfriend who constantly signed me up to help with projects around the house only to set unrealistic expectations and critique me after painting the outside bannisters oh no i let too much paint drip scrape it off and start again fuck that why the fuck did i let him get away with that shit oh yea my girlfriend i guess it was worth it
all i can think of is how unpleasant it must have been for the actors to film basically the entire movie in front of green screens or in this case blue the set makes for immersion and my understanding is much of these films were just done in studios like this how unpleasant and difficult it must have been for them how unfun and not immersive
the lightsaber battles from the prequel trilogy were the best in the series i didn t much care for the movies otherwise but great fight choreography
maybe if the light saber battles looked like this the prequel movies would have been slightly better
haha this is so cool
the choreography of this lightsaber fight is fucking insane
ama zing how the actual fuck does this get less upvotes than starwars kid
getting your eye ball burned is actually really painful like seriously i had hot chemical grease splash in it i was blind in my left eve for a week and my other eye didn t want to stay open
the only good thing to come from the prequels is the lightsaber combat not to harp on the og movies or anything but much more interesting than two old guys slowly tapping lightsabers together
would be much more interesting if the vfx composting was removed and the takes weren t edited into a sequence this is sort of like the movie less the background layer
i know this is all meant to be a spectacular fight looks great and can be explained that all the misses are caused by force bubbles shielding them or something i do medieval fighting as a hobby watching this made me see about times anakin could have sliced his arms off dooku missed an opportunity at the end during the sabre catch to just gut slice with a little angle change when he came back across right at the beginning dooku could have died if anakin and kenobi swung front and back separately he can t block two sabres at once not to mention speed just needing to be increased by anyone would result in a win i enjoy a good sword fight in any show and lightsabres are fun to watch this is all dancing and the is poses a battle its a forcebubble slow motion force and mind battle if i want to make it all work
way too flashy and useless movements even for the world of star wars
the people that made that badass edit of the obi wan vader fight from anh should take a crack at this
i don t get how he was able to grab the light saber with his hand when he kicked him off the platform
that guy sounds like comic book guy
im not left handed either
all this star war prequel over analysis just reminds me of nostradamus
what did dooku tell anakin to piss him off
holy force ghost
this is backstage footage why are their lightsabers looking like real like in the movie lol
is that jedi master cin drallig
cool
it s pretty cool that they used real lightsabers
when dooku switches his grip to reverse right after getting kicked off the ledge was pretty sweet as well
most people hated hayden christiansen but she literally slayed the lightsaber duels
twice here
what we got was pretty darn similar was it not the choreography for the prequels is fucking nuts
there were a ton of production issues with episode
you good
let the anger flow
you sound like you re ready to kill oldlings
did you tell him you were going to go break down some box upstairs
i know a good prank to get him back take lightsabers and cut off his head s
see this is what you get in my house when you spill paint in the garage andrew clark s dad
just curious did your highschool girlfriend have a brother by any chance
i genuinely find it so impressive people can actually do this type of acting where it s literally just you and some people standing in an empty green blue spaces looking at some random guy in a skin tight suit pretending to be an alien or a magical creature and you actually have to pretend to be impressed or scared or whatever lmao or doing some emotional scene with a character that looks like this https://www.reddit.com/r/moviesinthemaking/comments/8onuwp/sean_gunn_who_plays_kraglin_as_the_stand_in_for/)
sir ian mckellen actually broke down on set of one of the hobbit movies because of this if i remember right it was really sad
maybe if the light saber battles looked like this the disney trilogy movies would have been slightly better
tbf most of the fights in the prequel are pretty good iirc it s mainly just that awful yoda palapatine fight that sucks and anything involving jar jar like someone else said there s barely any in the new ones which is a shame
yeah at it s so obvious he s aiming for the other lightsaber and not the entire exposed body also that would also have been the perfect time for red to sidestep and gut hayden
yeah it felt weird seeing dooku sweep across anakin s body like that without readjusting his attack after the lightsaber drop
username kinda checks out also i came to
twice the pride double the fall
i m still cumming and it s kind of a problem
lightsaber duels in episode were sick af and i ll die on that hill
while yes i think this is probably the best choreography there has ever been for a lightsaber battle
lots of people shit on the prequels and they re not wrong but the choreography in the lightsaber fights across all three movies is some of the best combat in any movies ever
deleted
just rewatched and the fight we got was much worse many of the cool moves including the awesome light saber drop to avoid having anakin s hand cut off was not used
goood goood your hatred has made you powerful
he good he good he just had a little ptsd moment it happens to all of us when browsing reddit while sitting on the toilet
i agree it requires some series professionalism and craft i bet the blue screen takes a lot of the fun out of it though ewen mcgregor still did a great job
what lightsaber battles
don t go on the star wars subreddits and say that or that those sequels were a soulless money grab i did and got massively downvoted and criticized lol
hayden s cringe acting aside almost all his lightsaber battles looked like a ballet i think the role of ankin vader is just cursed young anakins actor was cringe hayden was cringe the scottish guy playing vader got chopped the actor under thr mask got cgid out to be replaced with hayden jej got screwed on his pay but is really the only one that made out and though obi wan was kinda bad hayden s performance wasn t terrible anyway yes the new films were short of battles but then again so were the originals but still more short of the mandalorian imo which also has run its course they need to stop with everything star wars
episode was a great flick in general if ep were on the same par as ep3 prequels wouldn t be viewed so poorly imo
as far as i remember they were great in each movie still fine in the sequels and okay in the originals also very good in the shows
mm probably though i think for story purposes obi wan did need to be there correct
not much of a battle but vader s moment in rogue one was so sick
can you back that claim up
let the paint drip do it
for sure i think ian mckellen basically had a meltdown on the hobbit set about how awful it is iirc
maybe if lightsaber battles sequels bearable
andor was one of the best tv shows let alone star wars projects in recent memory
i don t think hayden s acting was cringe he was given a lot of shit dialogue even liam neeson and ewan mcgregor have a hard time pulling off some of their lines without looking absurd
i feel if the original trilogy fans were kids again when the prequels came out they understand our generations appreciation
i agree but something about episode man the anakin and obi wan fight at the end is still unmatched for me
fuck the story give me bad ass dance fights
in terms of looks cool and is hard for the actors to do yes it s cool but from a swordsman perspective you can see most of the strikes are aimed not at the body but at the other saber especially when the stunt double raises his lightsaber leaving his entire chest exposed it s like two people playing chess and blocking every move but the whole time both kings are in check
no he just likes disagreeing
absolutely you can watch it right now on disney i suppose for a small fee i will take the time to describe the differences in real time to you if you would like
it s just the result of good writing episode was weird episode was pretty good and episode was absolutely excellent
that s some great insight
i imagine so

the super rich are getting rid of even the pitiful pensions we see now because in the future people will be just forced to work right up until death

if we managed to topple blackrock as a whole we d fix a lot of problems in the world they have their greedy little fingers dipped in everything from war funding ownership of the banks that own your house to big pharma media and politicians fuck blackrock
blackrock is destroying middle class neighborhoods and making it impossible for younger people to buy a house they are an enemy to middle class america and real working people eff those fuckers
this is exactly the kind of situation a corporation could justify using a real private security service to keep the piece
at least they know who to be angry at
i wonder if fox news will also call this an orderly tourist visit
bet you they care about the safety of their office workers
god bless the french
that s a lot of camera folk and not so much people invading the building
people ask why americans don t do this america would ve deployed tanks and blackhawks by now our police went full military after waco the only way we could do this effectively is if we used our guns to wage real war against our government property damage means nothing here
what even is blackrock
burn it to the ground
finally some protestors who are after the proper target for once
blackrock is evil burn them down good scorch earth their butts

blackrock can suck off and die
how can the corporation not give them what they want now checkmate blackrock
i love it fuck blackrock
i never want to see violent protests but man i do hope that blackrock tumbles destroying so many families hopes of owning a home of their own the articles the media are putting out look like articles from the onion that thr younger generations are destroying the economy because they re only spending their money on the necessities of life and not spending elsewhere

cut off the head of the
i wish shit like that was happening simultaneously worldwide
the french always through the best riots protests
the french are badass like that
all this for what comes down to demographic issues of a country not having enough children for the quantity of seniors and life span increasing
is this the black rock that owns america
fuck blackrock
black rock is the perfect reason we don t need corrupt billionaies and trillion dollar corporations they stick their smelly dick into everything
eat the motherfucking rich
hell yeah
they own everything it s too late they probably own the company the mines the material for the flares own the company that makes the flares owns the company that sells the flare and the insurance company that s going to pay for the damages
blow that place up in minecraft
the leadership of blackrock and all those companies should removed from this planet
fuck black rock you wef pieces of shit

putain blackrock indeed
fuck yeah
fuck there is an office of there right by me i should storm the fort solidarity
time to eat the rich
beautiful
a corporation isn t a sovereign nation using the word invading is kinda inflammatory especially since it s a protest
why are these people mad at blackrock are they just angry because they gave their money to the government instead of investing it in a fund like blackrock not sure how that is blackrock s fault
can they collect their pension in prison
deleted
i wish i lived in france this shit looks fun as fuck
hope they burnt that place to the ground let the people out but burn all the nice things
the rest of the world is protesting and rioting and us american fucks are just sitting at home letting the government have its way with us
why the flares they gonna burn themselves
i mean duck blackrock but not everyone in blackrock is bad like ww2 germany was bad not every german was but seriously fuck blackrock
ooooh things are beginning to get spicy are we gonna have a civil war part the electric boogaloo
i love the french they know the government works for them not the other way around
the elite of the world need to remember who the fuck really has the power countless nobles and monarchs or dictators have lost their head for less it s time the people take back what s theirs across the globe

sometimes people who do stuff like this without any equipment are the most skilled i once called a professional to remove a wasp nest and he showed up without any safety equipment he wasn t one of them
better pop a quick c on that box this way we all know it s fillied with a cobra
shows just how little i know about catching a snake it appears that the first thing you do is piss it off as much as possible the more you know
bro just talked the snake into getting in the box wtf
plot twist the snake and him are good friends and puts the snake in homes for the owners to call an expert where he happens to be in the area and collects a reward
his charm knows no limits
it seems like king cobras don t want to fight they want to be left the fuck alone and these guys understanding it it s like rescuing an introvert at a house party quick get in this box and we ll carry you home
i love how he got it to go in the box at the end
you have defeated all the snakes now you must face the final boss king cobra
fuck your box hold the phone looks pretty nice in there let me check this out for a minute the snake probably
australian here that is a decent sized snake
does the hand above their head fuck with their depth perception or something
yeah i d just go inside lock the doors and start looking for a new place to live the snake can have this house
ugh he got musked that smell
my man was just checking out the bedliner to see if it would fit his snake truck why he gotta be yanked around by the tail like that don t put stuff on snakebook marketplace if you re not going to sell in good faith
holy hell that s horrifying
damn dude snake boss
this guy could be a hostage negotiator at one point he let s go of the snake and it bum rushes him at like ft high and he s cool as the other side of a pillow no f ing way if that thing showed up in my house i d just move
outside snake is like i will fuck you up sees bin yeah i ll take this instead
king cobras are easier to handle than rattlesnakes copperheads mamba boomslangs and california kingsnakes i ll add context a king cobra strikes with of its body it tries to appear large when attacking this evolutionary mechanism has led to a reptile that uses nearly of its muscular structure to stay rigid that is why a king cobra cannot strike up left or right only forward and down when a cobra is going to strike left or right it moves its body to stay straight and rigid that tells you when to slide back your left or right leg king doesn t want to fight or kill you it wants to escape it will not remain stationary for long as it will constantly try to get away a king cobra cannot pivot its head while your grabbing its hood all it can do is move forward or try and move the majority of its body to turn around and face you if you look online for catching king and again i emphasize king cobra because the above does not apply to most true cobras the king is not a true cobra you can find dozens of videos where people are catching them and you will see exactly what i m speaking about then go watch someone wrangle mamba or a boomerang or even a non venomous cal king and you will see a lot of patience caution and respect will kill you and the 3rd will keep biting until it realizes your no threat some more dull information on king cobras they rarely cause death they need the venom for food your size tells them you are not food and its only goal is to get away while conserving venom for food sources this is why the majority of king bites are mild or dry a mild bite usually comes from a 10ft or smaller its like sex and age the older you get the less eager you get and the more conservative your actions become when your young its like the only driving factor you have or so it seemed to be so in my teens and 20s a dry bite is a bite where no venom is released my largest fear from a to 15ft king would be salmonella having had it times from snake bites i can tell you it is no pop a pill and it will be fine ordeal now a cobra to be shit fearful of is an indian cobra it is a true cobra and it can pivot jerk swing and will give you a hot bite at any age i ve never even heard of a dry indian cobra bite that is because its involuntary when its fangs go in the glands compress from reflex and it empties both sacks i would say a dry bite would be an accidental scenario where someone was bit within hours of an indian feeding i understand people s fear of snakes but the best way to cope with a fear is education sure exposure helps a lot but id suggest reading and watching video games before i would suggest someone buying a wild caught king cobra to confront those fears
sphincter clinching content
dudes playing russian roulette
can someone translate
it s awesome to see how they treat it with the respect it deserves
if that cobra supposed to be 4m then i m 3m tall lol
the musking would deter me more than the mouth havent smelled a cobra specifically but garter snakes and kingsnakes fuckin stank
aggressive beastie while where i live as the most venomous snakes in the world cobras are far more aggressive even if they are more predictable than a taipan or eastern brown
australia thailand
as someone in bed in a rural village in thailand i didn t need to see this right now
i really feel like those long catching stick things seem safer
thai people and indian people with the king cobras make the rest of us look super soft id hate to grab a little snake barehanded let alone the f ft king cobra
such a beautiful animal i hope they didn t hurt it
unhand me peasant i am a king plzzzzzz dethroned cobra
i hate snakes but i always love vids of king cobras because to me they always look like they re like what bro you wanna go lets go bro you wanna taste of this i could taste you and elephants and you all wake up dead
he found mongoose dna in his me
they could have pinned it with stuff used tools and created a kerfuffle but they kept the snake relatively calm throughout the encounter and that s what was most impressive to me
he is years old and the oldest of his whole family of snake hunters
snake so scared she squirted
did i see the snake piss
so bad ass so cool to see people that are good at what they do
there are some things i just don t wanna not be good at
this is totally different from what i just saw in facebook some guy got killed by an already dead kobra because he tried to put his palm on its mouth with its fang in attack mode what a waste of life
what country is it ive got to remember to never visit it in my life
something something knows how to handle snakes with his bare hands something something
big ones
you catch this thing you can catch greased lightning
nerves of steel

the whole i was worried they were going to kill it or do something horrible to it can anyone translate and let me know that the snake is ok
he makes it look so easy
did it go to the bathroom
anyone notice the snake piss itself that is one scary fucking snake
he is one bad day at the job away from death
all set with that shit
see and i would just burn the house down
bro made cobra shitted himself
so this is what they teach you at cobra kai
he nailed the nokia snake game
danger noodle that s a nope for me
that snake was so impressed he made that guy his new king
so much respect for these dudes working with the snakes natural behavior to make their job easier and handling him with care why try and cram a snake into a box when you can just present it as a safe little cave and have it slither right in well done
that guy is highly skilled experienced i m impressed i think i saw that snake pee on his hand which i ve never seen before that was pretty nasty
how are they doing this so easily in spite of such a low center of gravity because of their ginormous steel balls
sir we re going to have to ask you to please leave the premises lol fuck you please ugh fine but you re carrying me
little do they know he plated his pet snake there and they split the cash to remove it oldest trick in the book
cobra wins with that tail whip to his face at the end
the tail slap is funny you may have gotten my head but i still got my other end to work with
good work hiss i think we convinced em theres some treats for you in the box good boi call ya tomorrow for another job wink wink
you ve heard of elf on the shelf now here s krait in a crate also i laughed at how the snake micturates all over the guy s hand in the early part of the clip
twist it is his trained pet snake and he releases it in peoples houses then waits for the call
that moment when the cobra is in his grips that s the moment when he can charge whatever price for his services
how does he get his pants on around those gigantic balls
is that guys name riki tiki tavi
did that snake piss it s self when he picked it up
give that man a raise
i wonder if he s trying to look like another bigger cobra holding his flat palm over its head like that sort of looks like a cobra s hood
i m sick of these alpha male wannabe bitches harping on about how much bench they can press how much pussy they think they can get how big they wish their dick was this is what an alpha male looks like
seems he d be really good at dodgeball if you can dodge a snake
given the size of this guy s balls he moved around very quickly
oh wow they don t kill it jesus christ almighty
going to end up in a wok or a bottle of liquor
thank god to run the beautiful motif of that bed liner and the giant green meat grinder w a would be an interior designer nightmare
big ass snake that s dinner
i have a shotgun just for these occasions
snake expert without even a tool catch
so i guess the expert doesn t work with catching snakes then not having any tools for the job
so it s between the india guy and the thai guy here in reddit
no one with that haircut should be this competent
who needs men right
yeah fuck all that maybe my american is showing but i d put a few rounds in that fucker then catch it bare handed
why dont they just kill it
that s a big nope rope
in the end the snek is like let me in this nice dark box away from you two apes
dumb ways to die
yawn typical tuesday for me nothing special what s the big deal
i d have put the fucker through that machine at the back of the room twice then set fire to the house
these noodle texts are everywhere

this dog is better than me at skateboarding damn
what a legend
tony dawg
it was cool when he went down the stairs it blew my mind when he skated off and started steering around everything
i can t come into work my dog is sick
more impressive is the other dog skateboarding and holding a camera steady
praise the camera dog
bruh my life sucks
i was going to say the skateboarding dog videos are old then i saw him casually skate down the stairs wow
my dumb ass was thinking that s not france
far better driver than me

this dog is definitely going places
funniest and most badass dog video i ve seen lmao he even has a cool looking jacket
good filming technique as well
this dog is way cooler than me
and this isn t even his final form
for a second i wondered if this was ai generated it s likely not but i wonder in the future if such questions will be common then what will we think of astonishing things like this but are indeed real
a real french bulldog would be in rioting against the pension laws
i ve never really wanted a dog until right now i want this dog
i always wondered how that dog figured this out now i understand
they can do everything but pay bills

i m kinda of flabbergasted don t even know what to say
bro is not leaving any bitches out there for us

yet another reminder that half of the folks engaged in deep political and social commentary here on reddit are
for what reason do you keep having alpacas at your school d
when he leaves again you can say wait for me alpaca bag
this kid is ahead of the game already posting on reddit and then re posting a year later get it
if you love something set it free if it comes back it s yours forever case closed
that s brilliant i love this lol also do your homework on time be kind to others stand up for those more vulnerable than you and don t give your parent s too much back chat good luck to you kid
i feel like there s a disney movie in here
i m assuming you are him keep it going brother the world is very interesting and you will love it each step of the way always stay positive
did he get a haircut
alpacas are ok by me year old young men can be a mixed bag
are those teeth
i think he remembers you
did the alpaca remember you
so the alpaca came backa ever have a llama give you any drama
r mademesmile
it s kids on reddit
this better not be an ad for travis traveling alpacas
ngl i m jealous
bro from virginia or what
i absolutely love alpacas i m thinking i ll retire to an alpaca farm someday
look at the fuckin bottom teeth
his teeth grew a bit
i always thought i was special because i have both a cat and a dog now i feel like i m substantially underperforming
great post
keep absolutely still
you have an alpaca friend
not sure why the 2nd picture made me laugh so much
did he remember you
wholesome
interesting as fuck
bro you look like chucky lmao
this is hilarious kids think the dumbest shit is interesting
he got your money back
i forget that everyone isn t old like me
hahahahhah
it s a painful truth
honestly i have no clue
ap alpacgebra
you know it
mom dad meet our new pet
thank you
thanks man
yes he did
yeah they got really big
i think so
the second comment was someone saying they were into me
shhhh don t tell anyone
nope born and raised in canada
i can t tell if he loves me or wants to kill me
i think so considering how he acted the same to me as the first time we met
i thought it was
i think this is the worst thing anyone has ever said to me
chucky n cheese best friends
yeah kids are so stupid
this is sad this redditor thinks that demeaning a wholesome r interestingasfuck post since they noticed the poster was a kid is worthwhile please leave your mother s basement and mature
how sad is your life that you gotta go out of your way to say some irrelevant shit like this grow the fuck up
you re not alone it s weird to think that there are different years of kids younger than me
don t smoke weed until you got your dream job
interesting d
ain t that the tooth
alpacas will starve to death if their teeth get too long in the wild they only live at certain altitude where the vegetation is coarse enough to grind down their teeth at machu pichu for example they use to have alpacas there but they starved now they only have llamas
damn kids these days and their alpacas my lil bro s school got one too
but it s definitely true
damn good one
hahaha
just wait kiddo i remember being like it was yesterday i blinked and now i m almost it flies by enjoy it while you can
you re over the hill
i first made this handle when i was your age it s old enough to vote now
or until you reach uni if youre in stem youll need it lmao
i have sensory issues and so i hate the smell of weed and i don t plan on liking it anytime soon

do you regret it
damn college is so expensive that you gotta smoke the stems too this is why i chose crime
your username threw me off i know how those sensory issues can be i can not touch construction paper and only recently got over my issue with touching card board because one of my job involves a lot of it wipe someone s ass no problem touch the plastic wrap on a pallet no you
i hate living d
you are hilarious hahaha
more and more every day
making this handle or being your age
stem can help me do crime better if it doesnt work out
i had to change my username because everyone would think the uppercase i was an l but it used to be hiitstravis hi its travis
i m so glad someone else has issues touching construction paper lol i don t know what it is but having to write on construction paper while doing projects in school made me sooo uncomfortable and like weak like my hand would hardly work when it was touching the paper i hated it
cost of living outweighs benefits d
says the one downvoting my comment like its gonna do anything lol little boy who are you to speak on another kid
the handle
oh really i need to google wtf that is haha
from what i gathered after reading two sentences from google about it this is indeed a course that would benefit a career criminal sadly it was just a hobby for me
was howdymynamesistraviswhatsyours taken
i think it s those weird tiny hairs on it gave it an extra level of dryness and a weird soft rough combo that makes my brain short circuit
i m not downvoting you don t hurt yourself thinking about these comments little guy
nah
stem science technology engineering and mathematics
it was sadly
yeah i think that s exactly it even just thinking about that sensation makes me shiver in disgust
lol you definitely are nice try tho and dont got anything original you can say i just called you little boy now im little guy just shows how developed your mental capacity is again youre a child too that is indeed hilarious thanks

the young males were in musth you can tell by the temporal drainage on the side of their heads and dribbling trickling of urine the males were only really trying to protect the herd and when reproductive hormones are raging in them they can be pretty dangerous the big female probably recognized the humans when it got close and was trying to redirect the males while at the same time leading the juveniles busy day for the old lady
i didn t know elephants sounded so goddam scary
earl earl do you even like peanuts mother fucker that is the peanut man the fuck earl pay some respect
humans are friends not food
the minute mark where a road of elephants just jogging down the road
the matriarch female leader elephant is so fascinating they lead their herds for their whole life from body of water to body of water with only the knowledge of navigating location of food passed down from the previous matriarch if the knowledge of a matriarch is ultimately lost the herd may struggle to survive without guidance one of the most amazing creatures
if any species could succeed us it s this one
what do the men repeat
i don t care how dangerous it is here in australia at least i know i won t get trampled by one of these
stop you idiot those are the apes with boomsticks
well that would be terrifying what a nice lady elephant keeping things civil
frank no frank frank no these are good squishies they re good squishies frank no
hoooly shit what a death stare
sooo be nice to the elephants they might save your bacon also there was an interesting case in an african preserve they found they needed a certain number of older male elephants to keep the younger males from killing other species indiscriminately
elephants are chill until they re not
i still don t get how they get them ears to be so sweet and crunchy
bye thanks for your service elephant charging new level of terror unlocked
watching the herd run down the dusty road towards the truck was bone chilling
the tame elephant s trunk touched the other one right on the temporal gland basically where you d say the temple is on a human they excrete oily hormones that actually drip wonder if its a councidence
that trunk to temple telepathy was otherworldly
that bellowing is terrifying i d be absolutely scared shitless lol
the destruction of the elephants social structure has led to the young male elephants acting very aggressively destroying peoples stuff killing people and even raping and murdering rhinoceroses the older elephants teach the younger ones unless they re all poached and murdered
i feel like we don t even realize the slightest bit what kind of intelligence these animals have
i knew jurassic park used elephant calls for the trex scream but this is the first time i ve heard a real elephant sound like a fucking trex
hi bye oh hi bye bye hi hi bye bye oh hi bye hi bye oh hi bye bye hi hi bye bye oh hi bye hi bye oh hi bye bye hi hi bye bye oh hi bye hi bye oh hi bye bye hi hi bye bye oh hi bye hi bye oh hi bye bye hi hi bye bye oh hi bye
what do you do when an elephant attacks apparently you sit there for 5minutes and shout at it constantly that always works
this is interesting i have so many questions why don t any of them have tusks are they all juveniles and females these are asian elephants in which only bulls have tusks for african elephants both sexes have tusks is so why the second clip the elephant looks to be in musth so why aren t the rangers getting the fuck away there s nothing more dangerous than an elephant in musth they re insane on hormones and in agony they re known to attack and kill even their family and loved ones while in musth if you see that shit draining from their temporal ducts you get the fuck away from the ten thousand pound berserker surely forest rangers in thailand know that so i assume they know something i don t here
i like how the walk away like you win this round bitch but next time grandma ain t gonna save your ass
they are so amazing we really don t deserve this planet
r elephantsbeingbros
how do people kill these beautiful creatures
fuck i say about rushing park rangers they re keeping us from getting shot dumbasses y all wanna end up on some white guy s fuckin wall or something
they re teaching the young hotshots that humans are best kept on their good side

this is the reverse of those movie scenes where the ferocious _looking_ creature shows up and all the gung ho marines wanna shoot it and it s the one old scientist who stands between the creature and the rifles yelling it means us no harm
better muted the guy constantly talking is annoying
he is whispering stop he has a gun
frank i swear to god stop acting like a carnivore and quit trying to bite the hand that feeds you
what does pai pai pom pem pai mean
sounds like a v8 idling
r natureisfuckinglit
saddens me that these majestic animals may not roam the earth one day for our future kids to see
my favorite wild animal they re majestic
elephants are so smart my wife loves them and i got to grow much love for them as well
go to forest pompam
poor elephants
eh i wish humans were at least half as smart
i ve discovered something about myself i get irrationally irritated by repetitive sounds the sounds the humans were making got on my nerves words that i actually understand are bad enough when they are being said over and over again but when it s in a language i don t understand it is infinitely worse i wanted to tell them to shut the fuck up so i could quietly observe the elephants
one day ai will develop a way for us to communicate properly with animals i just hope that they are still around to talk to it s going to be a rally fucking awkward conversation though
just like people the young want to lash out violently at forest super the old have wisdom there s a better path
job with coolest work benefits goes to ranger officers since they apparently get elephant body guards
he s like trust me those are the good guys
that was intense
note to self when elephants are arguing make one s self scarce
how do we live on the same planet as these things
they re so intelligent and majestic i hope poachers get stomped
they re very smart leave them kids alone
grandma just laid down the fucking law brian
it s like they do the vulcan mind meld with with trunks
yo a car like that killed my cousin wilfred the phant hold me back bro
how much time does it take for an elephant to gain trust of a particular human
seen similar with the gorillas i think in the congo they love there park rangers i can only imagine the gorillas watching these rangers maim poachers
it s ears are flapping like go go away guys i distracted them
i m stoned and just imagining if this is how loud elephants are imagine what dinosaurs sounded like
god imagine being some poor roman soldier the only wildlife you ve ever seen is a boar maybe a deer or antelope in spain then hannibal comes over the alps with hundreds of these dudes charging at your lines
i love our flappy neighbors so much
what beautiful and intelligent beings it hurts to know they been hunted so much
why the fuck didn t the rangers just leave
lmao the barrage of noises from those guys ay ay ay oi wa wo wo wo aye oi oi oi wha wha wha
do these elephants not have tusks
goddamnit stop these things are erratic and vindictive they have butchered and enslaved countless numbers of us do not provoke them i know you are angry i know you hate them we all do but they will hunt us and kill us to the last one if we harm a single one of them even accidentally just back off and calm down before you get us all killed
equivalent of hold me back bro hold me back
bro bro they re chill trust me
stop making noise when the matriarch elephant is trying to help you it s infuriating watching this down vote me all you want but saying pai pai mai mai or whatever it is is making the male elephants in musk focus on you instead of going away wild elephants can t understand what youre saying and it s best to demonstrate your intent by body language if they re trying to scare the elephants with loud noises then they re not putting effort just back away slowly and stop making half assed noise as if they re calling the elephants to come even closer
pretty sure you should avoid that area during that time thank you
that elephant being held back like no fluff that he said next time bananas n watermelon i dont see either in his hands let me at em
changs are smart
the herd kill senior elephant bruhhhhhhuhhhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
looks like the space jockey from alien
yeah you better hold me back
lovely
truly magestic
woah woah tony vinny just chill i know these guys they re cool
is the driver wearing depends
amazing i loved watching this thank you
nah fam they cool
dey our frenz
wow this elephant screams matriarch of the group ain t no one messing with her
this is amazing i ve never seen elephants act this way
diplomacy
catholic so can t swear until sunday but just imagining facing these guys in the battlefields of history i d be soiling my pants brown no matter what type of armor i was wearing
chill out man these guys saved me in nam and little ricky remember the tusk massacre of yeah these guys fought them so back off
that s not them no fuck that that s no it s not i promise you fine
sounds like a death metal concert
i guarantee that the matriarch
am i an idiot or do elephants not have tusks anymore
this is indeed interesting as fuck the experienced elephants know the rangers don t mean any harm maybe even help profoundly

those people should just make spaghetti with spaghetti squash instead i ve done it and it comes out great you merely cut the squash in half length wise and run a fork down it to make the spaghetti noodles it s healthier and even tastes great my grandfather showed me how
it wasnt a prank as such it was an april fool and was brilliant
my grandma used to rent out rooms and once they actually had british guests there who believed this report and told them about it as a surprising fact they learnt about recently lol
i read spaghetti bush and then stopped reading where do i get one
they don t tell where to get a spaghetti bush i think it s a scam like bitcoin i ve never seen a bitcoin or a spaghetti bush
this is why we cant have social media people haven t changed much but now there are a million different spaghetti bushes out there
the lesson of this story is most people are alarmingly stupid
you simply wrap a spaghetto around a bush
needs to be hybrid bred with a tomato plant

asiatic pasta making technology reached italy s south central amalfi coast a few centuries after the fall of rome noodle makers dried their strands by draping them over ropes strung across roads between multi story buildings trees were for olives not noodles how many english entrepreneurs got rich by selling spaghetti trees to unwary britons
they also had a short documentary video of penguins flying to africa to migrate my kids showed it to me and decades later won t let me forget that i fell for it at first but it s the bbc they re trustworthy
no different from the msm nowadays
and the onion was born
years ago i was bored and stuck blueberries on the spikes of my cactus a friend from france came to my place and saw the cactus i told her they were cactus berries oh they taste just like blueberries good times
you better not let the italians hear you talking that blasphemy
it s not shocking at the time spaghetti and that wasn t a common staple in local gracers in certain areas
will trumpworld add spaghetti bushes to their available merchandise would the string bush alienate hardcore supporters asking for a fiend
now this is the kind of distruper thinking the world needs
moron

they re in both films from wikipedia susuwatari is the name of a fictitious sprite that was devised by hayao miyazaki and studio ghibli known from the famous anime productions my neighbor totoro and spirited away where in the former they are identified as black soots in early subtitles as soot sprites or dust bunnies in the streamline pictures english dub and as soot gremlins in the walt disney studios english dubbed version

yeah we lost power yesterday around 5pm it s still not back hydro quebec is expecting to get service back online some time tomorrow evening flashbacks
the window isn t broken when you roll the window down there is a flat sheet of ice still there that is what the dog is poking his head out from

til leeches are pretty fucking terrifying on top of the blood sucking horrible thing i thought was their bad thing
good lord this is terrifying
ugh i hate leaches i ve hated them since i swam in a leechy pond and had to pick them off when i was so gross and cre wait they have eyes
what the actual fucking fuck i hated that i hated that
are the slurping sounds totally necessary
see whenever you have a problem and you start having grim thoughts you can always remind yourself well at least i wasn t born a baby frog who has to escape from giant leeches
am i the only that thought they would just attach themselves to the frog not swallow the the poor little bugger whole then again i don t know what s worse being swallowed whole and suffocating to death or being slowly sucked dry i m single so i guess i ll never know about the latter
reminds me of the scene from king kong when they re being chased and andy sekis get it from the head
why they just standin still when a huge ass leech is about to eat em whole
imagine coming into the world unaware of the dangers then a giant leech comes and eat you before you even finish one full earth rotation
rip the cute lil froggies
i mean those frogs literally stood still until devoured i call it skill issue
leeches can grab with either end of their bodies wuuuut
nature can be so beautiful and so fucked up
where are these things native to so i can make a note never to set foot there ever
this is one of those times i mess with my buddy so did god just one day be like i want a worm looking thing but turn the nightmare fuel up to out of ten
are the frogs too immature to even try to escape they just sort of take it seems odd does anyone know if leeches have any sort of secretion thing that may paralyze incapacitate the prey
no foreskin jokes yet disappointed y all slippin
vore
r dontstickyourdickinthat
c o n s u m e
why reddit why
i really should call her
no face from spirited away funny thing is he also ate toads in the movie
my mouth is open i m at a loss for words is this real life
r valheim the swamp when you re still in leather armour
frogs exist worm oh boy am
it s a murderous butthole x200b this may well be the most terrifying thing i have ever seen on reddit
imagine the leeches bigger maybe to feet or say meters and thicker like as thick as your torso is wide just slithering around the darkness occasionally bumping against your back door
foreskin be like sluuurp
fascinating to be sure but i for one am not happy with the sound effects in that one
i hear sir david attenborough s majestic and knowledgeable voice i watch and i upvote that s one of my life rules and it s served me well
damn nature you scary
i played it backwards leeches were shitting out baby toads everywhere good times
the sounds are quite fucking creepy
this was painful to watch and i was watching with the sound off so i didn t even hear whatever sound effects people are saying were added in to make it even worse poor froggies
thanks i ate it
this reminds me of the giant bug chasm scene in king kong when the one guy gets swallowed whole head first that still disturbs me
this better not awaken anything in me
david attenborough could narrate paint drying and i d listen to the whole thing
foley artist needs to calm down
frog roomba
to be eaten by the ass end of anything jeez
what does it mean if i m slightly aroused
why is everything such a nightmare on smaller scales
you have the situational awareness of a toadlet
imagine getting eaten by a leeches butt
judging by the state of these comments imma just leave the tab open and check on it in the morning rather than watch right before bed
were the blowjob sounds really required for this
imagine if they were the size of humans
why why
noooo poor little bros
this shit gets to me way worse than any video of a lion tiger bear shark ripping prey apart
hunted by giant leeches those are possibly the worst words i ve read today
why didnt they drive species like this to extinction but went for the majestic ones
the audio carried like of the video the visual another my overactive imagination carried the other
forbidden vore
this is disturbing really disturbing
death by foreskin
i find it so frustrating that david attenborough literally says baby toads and the title has frogs in it
five pairs of eyes where
don t be afraid frog you re about to become a part of perfection
reminds me of that giant leech scene from king kong
first of all ew second of all ewwww
the added sound effects was unnecessary and sort of dumbed it down
i really didn t need the added sound effects to add to the nightmare i m having tonight
eyes they have fucking eyes
jizzus friggin christ imagine being swallowed live by a rectum type of creature but my question is if this double ended anus swallows things through both ends how does it poop
frog s like jokes on you i m into that vore
brb gonna go fight some giant leeches
swallowed hole you say unzips
everything reminds me of her
holy moly that s wild
r mildlydisturbing
is the slurping sound real or added by the op
i was going to sleep tonight was
one option the frog didn t consider was just keep jumping until you re out of danger damn you stupid frog
ffs somebody get a jar of salt
david attenborough is a treasure
u savevideo
no other nature footage has made me this sad like they re just little guys
well it s not too often when i m afraid and angry at the same time afraid because leeches are gross and creepy out of water angry because the toads were stupid enough to get caught
the concept that there are things dying to leeches on land is kinda wowing me especially for them to be frogs and not some bug
wait if it can devour from both ends of its body does it have teeth in its butt i m so confused
i m so happy that i m a human and living in the west fucking hell i have the best life
david attenborough never disappoints
r vore is this your doin again
this is next fucking level nature really popped off with yet another op strategy
oily shit
this made me feel itchy for some reason
was not expecting that but damm
tih giant leeches
thanks for the nightmares
after knowing how these are filmed i m always so sad for the guys getting eaten
and i thought no one could suck like your mom does
15cm how many chic fil a breakfast burritos is that
i just kept whispering oh shit oh shiiiiiiiit ohhhh shit throughout this video
bruh i have seen war footage that is less scary than this
that s cell absorbing android

satisfying
could binge watch this
this makes perfect sense until you try to imagine how it works underneath i mean there must be some giant wire coils but then wouldn t the wires get twisted underneath the same way too so how come it does not jam after the first twist they cant possibly be spinning the giant coils to avoid the tangling i would love to see the other side
thanks mr mcfeely
this is pretty close to how babies are made
who engineered that thats cool
what if the wire gets tangled up
u savevideo
then why do they charge so much for fencing contractor wanted grand to fence in my back yard
there ain t alf been some clever bastards
throw in some distorted guitars and you got yourself the beginning of a sick industrial track
waiting for the beat to drop
my life is now complete finally as a year old fart now i know how it s made
some would agree it is r oddlysatisfying
notice each cycle they are rotating opposite directions likely the spools are directly below feeding upward directly since it counters its own rotation every half cycle the spools won t tangle
i don t know how this one works but almost all the times i saw a machine that twists some kind of wire it generally had the whole coils spin along with the machine so it doesn t get entangled

aren t repetitive machining forming processes just regularly satisfying
not sure about that the side to side action interchanges the wires being twisted so the opposite direction spinning would not be untwisting the same wires that were previously twisted underneath same as above they would have to be moving the spools underneath either they spin too so the wires do not twist which seems very impractical as those spools are probably huge and this would require a lot of them or moving them in a way that the same two wires are always together so they can twist and untwist honestly i already overheated twice trying to imagine this
i thought about that and it makes sense but this one specifically would require a lot of very big coils which seems quite impractical

but those foods are high in calories so you couldn t eat very much i d be so hungry
somewhat important info buried in the article two thirds of his total intake came from junk food he also took a multivitamin pill and drank a protein shake daily and he ate vegetables typically a can of green beans or three to four celery stalks
source http://www.cnn.com/2010/health/11/08/twinkie.diet.professor/index.html
i heard about this studies while in university you also need to take supplements for vitamins and minerals for this diet since you won t find them on fast food also exercise still helps to create net calorie deficit
opens a bag of all three and squishes them together like a sub sandwich
i have seen so many fat people on tiktok deny that if they just stopped eating they would lose weight i even know real life people who deny that eating less calories would make you lose weight and that you need to eat calories to gain 1lbs it s crazy because i lost over 100lbs by just not eating as much like not eating when bored it s just science
corpses can t get fatter
i have done this more or less yes it absolutely works and for me the fat loss all my bloodwork charts being dead nuts perfect the only warning is you will feel like absolute shit most of the time so i incorporate actual healthful foods into my garbage food now all at a caloric deficit maintenance amount
i still get in boring arguments with people about this they re like oh these drinks are healthy they have antioxidants and tons of vitamins i m like well vitamin c is an antioxidant also this has tons of sugar it s just what people confused healthy i guess vitamins are good but most of us get the amount we need
cico doesn t sell books and seminars
so you re saying i can continue to eat like crap as long as i eat an acceptable volume of crap and a half hot wings and a half a coke here i come
can t think that it helped him with his sugar intake
can you share the article study
did the same thing years ago then developed t2 diabetes
i believe it but the problem is those junk foods stimulate the appetite but if you got strong willpower then just eat less calories it s fine looks so yummy
misinformationish article two thirds of his total intake came from junk food he also took a multivitamin pill and drank a protein shake daily and he ate vegetables typically a can of green beans or three to four celery stalks yes kcal counting is effective but this is not showing it s healthier just that you can lose weight which you can by eating low kcal of any food but again doesn t necessarily promote health
dude could have just dieted for two weeks with veggies and lean food then had a cheat day on the weekend people try to make this argument all the time and it ends up make them look stupid you would get sick having all of your calories come from this junk
this isn t interesting i thought it was common fucking sense stuff we learn when we re actually kids take in less calories than you use and you wont be a lardass amazing right
years ago i read of a guy doing the same with beer and pies meat pies
if i was living off doritos i d be eating like or family size bags a day i don t think that would work the same way
that must ve been brutal
to be calorie counting and only eating doritos and cookies and shit i d hate life
i lost about pounds in one summer while walking miles a day skipping breakfast eating a fast food kids meal with fries and sugary soda for lunch having fresh fruit as a snack and eating a regular healthy supper protein bread veggies every day on days i didn t work i walked more and probably snacked on more fruit as long as there isn t a medical issue interfering it s as simple as a calorie deficit which is often not really that simple at all
a diebetic cannot do that he she needs the low carb diet solution
so he basically went on a high carb starvation diet
big diet industry is coming for you this one simple trick to lose weight burn less calories than you eat
link to study
how many doritos can i have for calories
well i guess consuming less calories by poison is still better than whatever he was eating b4 then
self control the real mvp
me too losing weight right now down lbs whoohoo and while i am doing cico to make sure i am in a deficit i also started doing volume eating to make sure there is just enough to keep me full yeah i could get my calories in with these but god damn i would be hungry best tip right now ninja creami i have protein shake ice cream every night that has half the calories of a steak and more protein love it
fewer calories makes you hungry no matter what you ll feel hungry losing weight remember tho being skinny doesn t mean you re healthy either
yeah if he didn t eat that healthy shit he would have lost more weight
so i can keep eating like shit just take some multivitamins and canned veggies every now and then
don t forget to mention his off label use of ozempic
very good point the multivitamin is a big one pretty hard to lose weight when your low on your b vitamins
what article
also exercise still helps to create net calorie deficit very true but for those who haven t heard it there s an old saying that you can t out exercise a poor diet running burns about kcal mile so one candy bar means two miles beer is usually one mile per beer a medium mcdonald s cheeseburger value meal is kcal so that s a lot of miles controling your consumption is best for controlling your weight and exercising is best for increasing your fitness level put the two together for best results
i lost lbs by lowering my food intake but i hit a plateau when i hit lbs so i just ate even less like chicken breast and cup of brown rice for the whole day and i still did not lose even more lb after that all that happened was my body shut down and my metabolism slowed down so far that my body stopped producing heat i had to wear a thick jacket for the whole summer because i just couldn t stop shivering from my body being so cold and my body also became lethargic slow and weak i never made it to the beach because my body refused to lose weight
this guy gets it
he did
this is not showing its healthier just that you can loss weight key to weight loss its uhhh its in the title you misunderstanding something isnt misinformation its you misunderstanding something
his point was about weight loss not health
your comment misses the point the dude is just trying to show that cico is more important overall for weight loss than the food you re eating no one is advocating for a doritos and oreos diet just that you can eat unhealthy food as long as it s in moderation and within your calorie budget
eat less calories than you burn
mines been missing since
veggies are very low calorie so you can gorge yourself and binge eat and lose weight unless you use lots of butter and fats
no hunger response is also related to physical fullness you can eat endless lettuce and veggies and fill up
yep if you die you loss weight extremely fast
yep just limit yourself to doritos half an oreo and the wrapper from the twinkie
there is a famous study that was done on men with type diabetes they fed them a bunch of sugar and rice on a very high carb diet they were however in a caloric deficit the results all of them lost weight and improved their diabetes
oh oh oh ozem oh ffs that jingle is maddening
this is only part of the truth exercise raises your basal metabolic rate a person who isn t very active might have a basal metabolic rate of calories per day at rest but an athlete can have a base level of calories on days that they don t work out it isn t just about what you burn during your workout
michael phelps used to eat calories a day during his olympian swimming days i think he could out exercise any diet
if you had made it to the beach you d have seen every single type of body there
true
lol thanks dang it
ok sure always somebody that has to point out the extreme case you are right
this guy gets it
yeah let s use an extreme outlier who is unquestionably a statistical anomaly as the perfect example
i mean a high veggie diet will help with fullness on a diet eat some celery two stalks is about calories an entire head of romaine lettuce is about calories cauliflower one head is approximately calories an entire cucumber calories entire bell pepper calories you eat a huge salad or chop up some veggies you can eat bulk without packing in calories oz of chicken is about calories
no its a point about metabolic rate daily caloric burn isn t isolated to just workouts
i agree and drink water till fill up usually in general you ll feel hungry when dieting tho especially if your active i joke with my wife and sils when they say complain they re hungry at least your losing weight they think its soooo funny

before the bosch haber process bird poop was one of the few ways to get nitrogen into the soil some countries even fought wars over small islands in the ocean covered with bird poop
i wonder if those towers have good a coo ustics
what lead to it being abandoned seems like quite a good idea to keep it going
your numbers are off can hold as many as pigeons https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/450802/pigeon-towers-significant-but-strange-buildings-of-ancient-times)
probably kept the bug population down are there any of the birds left
panga sinan from the philippines is a wanker
so cool
more info and pictures https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2020/02/rich-hawkins-pigeon-towers-riyadh/
they all died from lack of food i know this because i made it up
save the pigeons
i bet they had a group of slaves to scrape it all up every day
now they don t care about farmland they just gouge the world by restricting the oil supply
watch out sand people can be dangerous
the us enacted a law i think it was the 1800s saying that any us citizen can claim an uninhabited island for the us if it s covered in bird poop
there you go
the pigeons were mostly used to send messages in the past it was probably abandoned after there was no use for that and people moved into cities for better lives there are no pigeons there anymore either it is now a historical landmark for tourists
they re technically not wrong there are hundreds of them about hundred lol
thank you my first thought was it doesn t seem like hundreds of pigeons would do much
pigeons aren t insect eaters unfortunately that job would have gone to something else
sadly there are no birds left
those fucking pigeons and their oil supplies
they do export more food than mexico
also salt peter and explosives were made from pigeon shit
true but hundreds of birds will take a long time to fertilize a field whereas will do that task quickly
i m not gonna lie i think if pigeons controlled the oil supply we d be much worse off
salt peter father of salt bae and master of bird poop
not just pigeon
you just got woooshed hundreds is lol
fourteen thousand is hundreds of birds technically
idk about any others i just know for about the pigeon in the 16th century the brits kept pigeon coops guarded by armed guards to keep the highly valuable pigeon droppings safe from theft
lol true that

what could go wrong
as seen in the original version of the italian job
ah so this is what the upstairs neighbor was doing
still does just can t drive it anymore
cool but it looks like a disaster waiting to happen
very cool but i d sure hate to work on the 5th floor wrooom wroooom wroooom
i m the only one that remembers the top gear episode
it s pretty cool and been in films italian job and lots of tv series iirc the way it worked was the cars were built starting at the bottom and when they were finished on the top floor they were taken around the track to make sure they were fine to leave the factory it s called the lingotto building https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lingotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lingotto)) which is also the name of the suburb of turin italy it s in
luckily they re fiat they re mostly pushed they don t go fast and make engine noises either
this is the real life verrckt map from call of duty world at war zombies
it s not more used and the factory now it s the fiat ghq
wtf as in why the fuck not that s awesome
r whatcouldgowrong
you can go up there now walk the track it s a cool building the corners are very very steep
didn t dare drive them too far from the mechanics
did anyone ever you know
seems safe
instead of getting a flag from the stewards for breaking track limits you die
the only version
not with that attitude
you could drive on it until recently though i ve seen a tv show restoration garage i think where they went to drive on it in the last decade or two
it was a fiat so might actually be the only lucky event to happen
well you are not supposed to put a desk on the racetrack
i thought it was on the grand tour
not at that altitude
car sos
err yeah i meant the floor just under the roof xd

that s a weird way to spend your evolution points
so long friend yea thanks fuck you too buddy
although it was initially believed that remoras fed off particulate matter from the host s meals this has been shown to be false in reality their diets are composed primarily of host feces oh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/remora
the sworn enemy of the blow fish
looks like something straight from subnautica
makes sense why remoraid is called remoraid
so long suckers
plop sonovab
their behavior makes sense they go where the action is
he didn t pay cumulative upkeep so he had to get rid of that fish
i never realised these things actually suction onto others i always kinda assumed they swam alongside the sharks or something
sticks remora to the boat you think this is fucking funny pal
when we d catch these we d slap them on each others backs lol it s a weird feeling
it must suck being treated like that
i got captured by aliens man they did experiments on me you believe me right shut up greg
i thought turtles were nature s suction cup raul lied to me
mystic remora
omg this was so cool to me
the fish what is my purpose god to suck
i like seasucker better
remoraid
imagine the shit we re gonna eventually find in europa s oceans so many alien looking creatures in our own i can t imagine what sea life looks like there and yes i m being insanely optimistic about life on europa but there s gotta be lol
the remora was like hmm this metal fish tastes weird
those feet of free fall was the scariest feet of that fish s life lol
takes a sucker to know a sucker
how is that useful
nature makes some weird shit
remoraid
gross i hate it
dude could you maybe be a little more gentle of how you re tossing it around
put em back in plz
yet the fisherman still sucks more
deleted
wait until you realise what they eat
are they able to fully control it or is it because he s out of the water
remoraid
bad fish get stuck to the boat roof
that sucks
nature is awesome
haha get stuck loser
i ve caught a ton of these never got use to the way they look
caught one of these deep sea fishing and it stuck to the side of the boat when reeling in took guys to pull it up
i ve herd that sound before
i thought it was a flip flop
what would happen if you put the two sucking ends together
ya i had one in a fish tank once my mom thought it was cute how it sucked on the glass and then we realized it was pale and dead mom found it less cute after that
they suck sharks
that thing would make an excellent car cell phone clip
i caught one as a kid when deep sea fishing someone running the ship said here watch this and stuck it to my upper arm the inside of their sucky boi feels like it has bristles inside of it it was very cool the remora itself was a bit smaller than the one in the video
am i a joke to you
no blackened remora on the menu tonight sniff
anyone see the movie layer cake that s where i first heard of these
i ve known a few of those in my life
so mystic
poor fish
why would a fish need this superpower
but now she feels like a romora from the sharks that can swim on the land jb
that shlop noise lol
wow that fish really sucks
after hearing that noise i should call her
there s nothing that you fish expert can say to convince me that this feature offers some form of evolutionary advantage
the sound did not disappoint
i caught a suckerfish i thought it was a shark oh i get it sucker
when you re fucking too hard
they get the to wear the coolest hats
where did he get that after market air intake
don t feed the fish
my my my remora
they are like a suction cup with a heartbeat is one of the stupidest takes on describing something that i ve ever heard in my life
they should call that fish lindsey graham
r dontputyourdickinthat
suck er fish you say
i miss that super nintendo game i think it was called garden of eden
kinda incredible though the effort it would save if it migrates in the same pattern as another big fish just zoop onto its belly and take a nap
have you ever seen testicles
imagine being that remora and being randomly stuck on the ceiling of a boat like i d be panicking like hell
at least now the fish has a story for it s grandchildren
i am not your buddy guy
they literally eat shit and die
in remora culture telling someone to eat shit is viewed as a great compliment
you know what they say taste is subjective
not entirely true is it image https://www.divephotoguide.com/images/lightboximage/orig/1610747929.jpg) it s a disturbing image but proves you wrong
i guess that line from layer cake still suffices
dang so the poster was being gentle when he said they were a swimming suction cup nothing else poor guys
a particular particulate matter from the host s meal
we need a petition to rename these suckfish
lol thank you
i still wonder why tf does it evolve into octilery
came here to say this
hopefully he got to draw a card or two
here we have a human i abducted from earth as you can see it s screaming a lot now i release him bye bye friend
true i would prefer to die of some random disease or being eaten alive
yeah it was a pretty sucky thing to do
don t feed that thing
they suction onto sharks for a free ride and free lunch
why are you getting downvoted for asking a real question what a reddit moment
i take it you didn t quite finish the video
potentially a significant person s voice maybe a child or lost loved one or a voice recording of his last order at wendy s
evo search for eden

no touching
the article and the law it references are very vague about this i don t think the secret service would be literally locked up i think they would essentially become a prison guard i assume the prison itself would collaborate and do something unique like designate a separate building for him so that he s never in contact with other prisoners or even prison workers
i guess we never really thought about the difficulties involved when an ex president commits felonies and goes to prison maybe we should strip him of his rights as ex president and make him ex ex president that would probably save us a few bucks
anybody thinking a president let alone a billionaire is actually gonna go to prison is delusional lol
i m picturing him being on house arrest at his resort he will never do real time he will be golfing and hosting parties
house arrest is the most likely scenario
didn t realize that link wasn t great hopefully this https://abcnews.go.com/politics/trumps-indictment-end-secret-service-protection-hed-decline/story?id=98311723) is better
can t read the full article unless you download the msn app
lol no us president is going to jail it s a media distraction tactic so we don t see the rest of the world aligning against us as our economy and culture come to a skidding halt
based on the ss response on jan curious deletion of texts from the day that s exactly where some of them should be
deleted
hopefully we get to find out
it s called being epstein ed that s what they want to do to him
they ll build him a special bunker under the prison his ss men would be his protectors and his guards
guns and knives of any kind are not allowed in prison so what would the secret service be armed with if they were inside the structure itself
but would the prison allow the secret service to enter
so if the president goes to jail he gets to spend the duration in solitary confinement sounds good to me
mob bosses don t get special treatment that allows their goons in to protect them no special treatment
joe biden not going to jail he s going straight to nursing home they can take care of people with dementia
this was actually the first thing that came to my mind when i heard he was indicted the actual logistics of it would be interesting i m assuming trump would get his own cell but walking around the prison he would need an agent with him at all times
lol
standing outside a minimum security cell would be no different than standing outside an office guard duty ought to be easier even because only the prisoners could pose a threat not one of a huge crowd of randos
supermax as entertaining as it would be to see that dinkus do hard time and need a supersized tub of anal lube he will end up on home arrest or compassionate release due to poor health or something
then how is he supposed to relieve them
i have the worst fucking lawyers
i guess one of them ll have to pick up the soap
you mean like in goodfellas right donald did the prep work he was doing a year for contempt and he had this wonderful system for doing the garlic
which is why i don t think trump would ever go to an actual jail if convicted and sentenced to any number of months years it would probably be isolation at an estate or somewhere away from an actual jail prison that would be my guess at least
i agree if any ex president ever actually served time
yeah that s pretty much it he will be housed in his out facility if not simply put under house arrest even if he does serve time it ll be the most relaxed time anyone has ever served
we could lock up the agents who deleted every text message
i think we can assume the usss will work in shifts and be allowed to go home after their shift so not really in prison what will happen to trump if he has to go to solitary confinement i guess the usss will be standing outside his cell
the secret service reports to the department of homeland security as such his detail can be removed is ordered by dhs
it s probably easier to protect a former president in prison they just make sure he has a cell to himself post a guard and check to make sure his food hasn t been tampered with normally they have to follow him wherever he travels and secure his rallies and speaking engagements much easier if he stays in one place
i think being ex ex president makes you president again somebody call grover cleveland he s our only ex ex ex president which i think made him vin diesel
oh we ve been thinking about it i say let the same guards that were used for another high profile person epstein
yeah that s where i have landed this is like when dr oz had to testify about basically promoting snake oil it s just a wag of the finger but of course both sides will have very strong feelings about even though nothing will come of it
the minimum security prisons rich people like the chrisleys and eventually elizabeth holmes go to are like country clubs compared to actual prisons anyway
i have said for years the absolute worst case for trump is house arrest at mar a largo
well leaders who left office since have been jailed or prosecuted in at least countries https://www.axios.com/2022/08/26/countries-where-former-leaders-jailed-charged and multiple billionaires have served time https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliesachmechi/2020/01/25/behind-bars-billionaires-and-ex-billionaires-who-have-served-time/?sh=4acc29524606 so maybe not that delusional
yeah but being a narcissist the thought of being labeled the worst president in us history would be enough to give him a temper tantrum for life
yup his life won t change in the slightest and his cultists will still cry that he s being persecuted
until jack smith throws down
it s the only realistic scenario

wth i don t have the app hmmmm
neat theory also the fucker has committed a shitload of crimes
culture
is this a rape joke rape jokes aren t funny you know that right
they ll build a wall and make him pay for it
all the best shivs really you can ask anyone about the shivs and shanks they re the best folks
pepper spray and or baton most likely
secret service agents aren t goons do you really think it s illegal for the secret service to be present to protect an ex president federal agents including the secret service have jurisdiction across the country he might be a dumpster fire but that has absolutely nothing to do with federal laws determining jurisdiction
man the security risk of allowing an armed ss agent inside the prison
melania has been relieving them up till now
he does it with the powers of his mind
search your feelings use the force
manually
daddy horny don jr
used to melt right in the pan it was a very good system
more pablo escobar he ll build his own prison in the tower for him and the jan collaborators
ultimately it made him something more than that it made him family
that s the absolute worst for anyone with money and power in that position
its delusional to think a former us president would house arrest is the only realistic scenario
but i appreciate the tip
i m on my phone
they said donald you have the best shivs and i told them listen to me i say i have the best and biggest shivs because my hands are huuuuge
are they prisoners or state employees no then they are trespassing
the force is what he calls his butthole
i don t know pablo escobar actually had money trump not so much
he can have any beer he wants as long as it s a corona
so long press and open in incognito window
i bet after you wrote that you thought boom lawyered bitch

funny how it looks much bigger at the beginning of the video nice work op it looks great
that is actually pretty fucking cool
that s fucking awesome you made this so cool
what flavor are they
lol i made one yesterday and it is glorious
that was really beautiful thanks
must make one or more likely many
how
no way that s actually pretty cool mine just kamikaze or boomerang
the visual perspective of this has me messed up
there was a video on here yesterday showing how to make these
nice i wanna make one
thanks t t the video isn t that great but is the least terrible one i got it s really hard to make a good throw while recording it with my phone in the other hand edit it was also super windy
that s how perspective works if its next to you its big if its far away its small the only thing this doesn t work with is your penis close up and far away it is still small
it s the origami bat posted earlier on the sub of the comments are calling it fake when i ve literally been folding it and playing around with the model for years look up flapping origami bat on youtube for a bunch of easy tutorials it s a decent paper plane the trick to throw it properly is you have to throw it a bit harder if you re using thick regular paper the thicker sturdier the paper the harder you have to throw it i think i m pretty bad at it
apple lemonade and blueberry please do not eat paper though
right i couldn t help but spend an hour playing around with it the first time i folded it
wish i could share the entire instagram story i made that one day i took the videos it had cool music and all on it tysm i linked a tutorial to the plane in the comments if you d like
there were like more of these off camera let me know if you can t find the tutorial for it
i suck at air physics but idk the tutorials work
they mostly did that on the one day i filmed this haha there s a little fold at the back of the wings that s very important for it to flap properly i m saying this because it s very easy to miss sometimes gets forgotten in tutorials i d recommend trying to throw them at different intensities to see what works best
and it got bombarded with comments saying they were fake haha a quick google search could ve fixed that but i had some cool videos from last years of me flying this exact model so might as well post something people are curious excited about that i crafted myself
well at least you don t use a tripod stabilizer and professional lightning to make an internet video good for you
perspective only works when you have something to reference it looked larger at first because we didn t have much of a frame of reference for scale at the start where as it got closer to the ground we were able to reference more area around it that s why smaller hands may help with your other issue
that s amazing great job i loved looking at it fly
edible paper exists yo
if anyone need any more proof that this model is real i got failed attempts left on my camera roll
candy paper or is that another thing entirely
rice paper or frosting there s a whole thing of edible inks and printers for edible stuff there s a lot lad
you have broadened my horizons please enlighten me make me part of the paper eating community insert gif of burning elmo

or just women in burqas
if they were anything like my grandma it may have been the mothers idea some of the time
this is an example of hidden mother photography https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hidden_mother_photography). from the wikipedia hidden mother photography is a genre of photography common in the victorian era in which young children were photographed with their mother present but hidden in the photograph it arose from the need to keep children still while the photograph was taken due to the long exposure times of early cameras
that is a very loose example of camouflage
is this after the era where the clear person in the photo was dead
look im invisible
it s missing a sickle and dead eyes
i just assumed things were just more cult like back then
it s sort of wholesome in an unsettling way
for some reason these pictures reminded me of the movie insidious
r therewasanattempt
i think the bottom two do a much better job than the top two but the contrast of the bottom left is messing with me it s funny seeing the bottom right one had a blurry hand probably from the toddler moving around too much
its a good idea but not exactly sublte
https://www.invisiblemother.com/
wouldn t seeing your mom turn into a cloth monster scare the kids even more
can t believe i never knew of this til
now people just identify as furniture
the table leg ankle thing makes so much sense now
it was a way of bringing focus to the subject of the photograph they did not have the technology that we take for granted today
all i m reminded of when i look at these images is lady donna beneviento and angie of house beneviento from resident evil village
it s furniture females now
proof of american taliban in 19th century
but why though did they charge by the number of faces in the photograph what s the reason for not showing the mother
came here to mention that
back in the day the best non blurry photos were taken of dead people it wasn t uncommon for a dead family member usually a child to be photographed sometimes the living family would be in the dead member s photo and you can tell the person is dead because of how sharp they appear
yes early american tableban discourages antique collectors
the point was to take a picture of only the children but they would get fussy so they had mom around to keep them under control the photographer would try to hide mom in the picture but as you can see it didn t really work very well most of the time lol
they would have a frame with a mat on it that would block out the mother which in these examples have been removed or lost over the years they didn t really have the sort of abilities with enlargers to crop photos between a negative to a print like we have now

yeah after days he was recaptured at this point he d commited enough crimes to be tried under china s judicial system so he wasn t going back to nk
in north korean former special force member ju syenjen zhu xianjian in chinese pinyin fled from north korea to china he then committed several robberies and thefts in china in he was sentenced to years in jail by a chinese court he got his jail time reduced twice for his good behavior in jail and was set to finish his jail sentence in august after that he would be deported to north korea according to court verdict in october that s after he spent years in jail and had more years to serve he escaped from jail apparently fearing being sent back to north korea where he would face death penalty for defection chinese authorities initially announced rmb award for people that could provide information that leads to his arrest the award was later gradually increased to rmb roughly usd after weeks he was captured again by chinese police in china escaping from jail gets a prisoner additional years of jail time so he is now still in chinese jail media reports cnn https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/20/china/jilin-prison-break-intl-hnk), rfa https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/shehui/ql1129a-11292021041659.html) in chinese
if anything my military experience has taught me that confidence and speed alone will win you of all obstacles encountered
he took that fall like a champ
jesus christ that s jusyenjen bourne
holy shit how far of a drop was that
that jump looks nasty
that fall was crazy it looked stories tall
this reminds me of a korean folktale my mom used to tell me there was a famous mountain by a village if you fell by down the mountain you would die in years one day an old man fell down the mountain and his family was in despair when his grandson asked why everyone was so sad they explained that his grandfather only had years left to live so the boys says why not just fall down the mountain again every years
the state facility i was at had sensors on the fence if anything or anyone made contact with it it would alert the guards sergeant to the exact sector of the fence that was hit quite a few false hits but saw enough lock downs to know it worked and worked well
is anyone taking about his gnarly story drop he recovered like a drunk toddler
i m glad the title mentioned shorting the wires i would ve thought it was muskets at dawn
guess chinese prison is better than whatever they would do to you before you die in nk
his s e r e training paid off
we had a local man bucky phillips https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ralph_%22bucky%22_phillips#fugitive_events), escape from the county jail with a can opener when you have all the time in the world to find flaws in the system some succeed
that fall
caught between chinese and north korean incarceration i d rather kill myself on that fucking electric fence
looks like the guy turned into a ghost after that jump
sleeping dogs confirmed
that was a brutal drop from that wall good on him that he was able to keep going
adrenaline is a hell of a drug if he managed to get up after that fall at first i thought he dropped down a rope or something
imagine comming from a country that is so worse you d rather stay in a chinese prison the rest of your life
so who released this video china is not known for releasing video that doesn t show them in a good light
was there a ptz camera trained on him at the end odd an alley cam would pan to center him in frame
wow at he runs so fast he lights the ground on fire behind him
oof that was a long drop
bro turned off fall damage wtf
what a sad end of life he is for the rest of his life stuck in a limbo between deportation and death and living in a supermax because of his wish to be free i know we read this and then scroll on while sitting at the table in our cozy homes and drink some coffee but let s remember that there are at this exact moment while you re reading this people out there in the world whose lives are ruined because of the power hunger of some dictator no matter how imperfect democracies might be in different countries at least we have the luxury to improve it and speak out we should be thankful for that
they got jason bourne nope they didn t
freedom for this guy
how the heck did he not break a leg or ankle or his skull jumping off that building looks like he might have used some rope but it didn t slow down his fall
that was a hell of a jump amazing he was able to get up
 5m  2mi  respect
if you act like you have something important to be doing moving quick and with confidence people often leave you alone because it seems like you know what you re doing and you re supposed to be doing it idk if that s though but it s been pretty useful in my experience
radio free asia enjoyers everywhere in this thread
jesus christ that s jason bourne
did that dude just jump off a story building take a little nap like a cobra bitten honey badger then get up and stagger away
that looked like a firm foot drop
the short circuit trick is not the impressive part that jump fall how tf
i wonder if the fence used ceramic knobs thinking old knob and tube wiring only term i can think of to hold the wiring he may have been able to just walk across them safely as he did without having to short the wiring to be safe i can t see them using metal supports as it would ground the current to the concrete or ground otherwise it looks like they are placed to keep people from climbing the fence to the building or out of the building but the building he climbed would be the one weak part of the defence as i m sure no one expected someone to be able to scale it if the ceramic knobs were located to the left and right but not directly over the building it would be far more effective
hope they changed his height in the wanted poster
why is the rope on the roof
that fall appeared to knock him out cold for a bit
that s quite the fall
omggg the story is so true it s amazing
i think they use wyze cameras the footage is very similar to what i see on daily basis from my wyze cams
maybe we should be more scared of nk than we think lol
the guy looking at the cams
maaan he dropped like a bag of potatoes xd
i thought nk and china like each other
that looks like a very nasty fall hope he gets away
first time rooting for the north korean but a little confused isn t china nk s greatest ally
oof that fall lol that would be the part they don t show in the movie wham just uhhh give me a second am i not dead whew ok back to running
could be a staged escape to let him remain imprisoned as an informant without raising suspicion
yo my man hit the ground hard af like a sack of potatoes he had to shake that one off for a min
the guy broke into several village houses robbed them and then stabbed an old woman several times because she wouldn t let go of her satchel i wouldn t feel sorry for him
should have put him in one of those finger traps
chinese prisons better than nk wow
did anyone else see something shoot at him from that building and then a little sound after it lands roughly where he was laying on the ground
i thought nk and prc were like budds and he s escaping back one prison to another
anyone else humm the mission impossible tune or nah
i m surprised that nk special forces means he actually has skills every time we see a video of their military it looks like a joke
the saddest part is that a family were probably brutalized for this escape if not multiple families
talk about being stuck in a catch where the best case scenario is you ending up in a hard labour chinese prison camp for the rest of your life
can t get sent back to nk if you keep escaping from jail
prob got an ass whooping fir that valiant escapade dude was fearless
like a tom cruise movie
i thought nk and china were friends why he be in china s jail
how did he not get electrocuted
china must be bad if the north koreans are wanting to leave
stop filming your fucking screen
how is he a prisoner of north korea if he is jailed in china this makes zero sense
absolute chad godspeed my man hope you get freedom
someone s been watching boondock saints
define saved his own life because if he was recaptured then he is dead
why would a north korean military prisoner be escaping from a chinese jail lmao china literally is the reason nk is where it s at rn they fund most of their economy why are they jailing their soldiers
fuck china and their puppet prison regime north korea
why doesn t china just implant tracking chips in every prisoner glad they don t as it leaves for an old fashioned escape
in my book he s earned his freedom make this man an american
damn chinese prison is preferable to north koreas treatment of defectors that really is interesting af
made in china stuffs
north korean special forces shits all over china obviously i m sure neither countries gonna like this and i love it
after russia is dealt with by ukraine we as a world should focus on removing kim and handing the country over to sk nk is hitlers wet dream prison camps the people are brainwashed they are taught to hate everyone but their allies and nobody can leave without russia being able to protect them its a great opportunity to fund a revolution inside the country so nato wouldn t actually pull the trigger
homeboy got up on adrenaline only to go find a quiet dark place to crawl and die
are we rooting for china or north korea here sorry i can t keep up
you can post any video and say it s about china or north korea or in this case both and americans will uncritically accept it as truth
did they take his rope
when looked at this way it kinda seems silly to have an electric fence on a breaker
fucking diabolical
u stabbot
that s not so tough i save my own life every day
jesus christ that s ju hyon gon
ok riddick
u savevideo
he didn t make it out of chy na though and is back in prison
why didn t he jump on a car
death row now with awesome aesthetics
the entire thing about china and nk is messed up but i m just wondering how amazing it must have felt for this man to step foot outside it s not like i m craving such experience but i d love to know how it feels
my security analyst brain going we ll there s your problem the entire time

i think america just got out america ed by the creators of k pop
bowling alley screens when a strike happens
how long does it take to count the votes there in korea because if it s too long i m sorry

i ve always wondered why everything has to be so over the top in certain parts of the world
with all the funding they get in my country why can t we make it look cool like this man south korea is lit
u savevideo
i didn t know i needed an off road 70s camaro until now
as an indian i just had a severe flashback
the world would be such a better place if everybody did this during elections
no idea what the politics are like in south korea but this looks a lot cooler than whatever the us has been doing
i kept waiting for one of them to spray paint thier face silver
wowee i wonder how cool north korea s elections are
okay clearly we do our elections all wrong here in the states we need to start having post apocalyptic muscle car races through the midwest deserts here
have u ever seen korean airlines pre flight safety video
apart from how terrible this makes south korea seem as a democracy this is pretty cool
this is actually embarrassing like something straight out of idiocracy
imagine if these is broadcast in north korea the dictator will kill himself
i m mildly upset they didn t ride out of the into the studio because it really looks like the animation was designed to work like that
damn i posted this before but never get upvote lol
what a great way to engage the public during the election i would actually watch that then the regurgitated crap spewed by the typical news station
let s begin the hunger games
let s begin the hunger games
this is the most beatiful shit i ever seen
biden would ve taken the wrong turn
policy nerds how can we get citizens to really engage with the complex policies that our electoral candidates represent tv news hold my beer
american influence
it s easy to make cool graphics when you already know the results a week ahead of time
and here we have south korea s entry for the cringe world championship
too cringe to watch
cringe korean gookbbong annoying
idk mad max isn t a great image to associate with sound democratic elected officials
this is absolutely insane
witness me
the song kinda slaps
wat
well that s just fun
at first i read this as north korea so i was like what votes
that s awesome
sponsored by state of survival
it s like a bowling screen lmfao
the beginning reminded me of x play on g4
it s like the screens at bowling alleys
is this the first to post apocalyptic post wins
gamification done right
yo that dancing tho
this might be the first election coverage ive seen that uses the unreal engine
i feel we re getting closer and closer to ideocracy
do they plan on being taken seriously at any moment in the future
koreans work too much until they go crazy and it shows
witnesssss democracy in action
i hit play on itunes the other day and it randomly started playing a kpop station didn t realize it for a second until i heard the song playing here next level and i liked it i thought do i actually like kpop and i had no idea then i listened to the next few songs and decided no it was just the one song i liked otherwise i was fairly right about my kpop preference but next level is good stuff
i need the full movie

damn nature you scary
how long is this in real time love how he washes his hands clean at the end
it s like eating at the chicken shop after pub closing time
i kinda love how it eats up the legs like pasta
getting eaten alive not a fun way to go
he almost makes that look tasty
if the theories end up being true i do not want mantis aliens coming here they ll destroy us in seconds
it s like one of those drumsticks with the caramel inside
i love how meticulously it eats
killed by a leaf truly the most embarrassing fate
something roaches can t survive i see
play this video backwards and it s a praying mantis 3d printing a roach how nice
makes me think about when i eat the innards of a crab
is it me or did the mantis leave the yummy most nutritious parts at the end
holy shit i watched it again what s wrong with me
they only come out at night mostly
he made the roach poop
the inside looks like yoghurt with a fruity swirl
if those were the size of humans we would all be fucked
om nom nom
thank you for the nightmare fuel
no fucking thank you
oddly terrifyingly satisfying
what is the left over white globby bit like was the mantis full or does it leave behind an undesirable portion of the roach
life is cruel as hell
straight to the brain praying mantis stares at you menacingly
what a vicious beast
the way it licked it s hands all satisfied
its crazy how the mantis can fit that much mass into itself the cockroach is huge relative speaking
i ve seen and can see a lot of things but fuck
there is no god
damn now i want to chomp on a roach
the point is you are still alive when they begin to eat you
damn that s gotta be one of the worst ways to die
my man is chowing down
slurping the legs like noodles
he love him some roach
a cockroach ain t nothing but a sandwhich to a mantis lol bars
like he s eating some good barbecue
i wonder if they have a favourite part oooh roach i m saving the thorax for last that s some good eatin
that s an alien species for sure
u gifreversingbot now it s a 3d printer
gross that is lowkey unnerving
that s ruthless and that appetite is insane
it slurped down the legs like spaghetti
that s exactly how my mama eats chicken wings
the greatest sci fi writers ever could not have conceived of that creature
meanwhile i m over here watching the victim s antenna twitch after the head falls off damn
that mantis worked on the beetle leg the same way my son maws a smoked turkey leg at the state fair
i once watched a female praying mantis not even mate with a male she just ate him entirely she was still around the next day on my window screen and did the same thing to another male
did he just lick his claws clean like we eat ribs
if you play this in reverse the mantis 3d prints a cockroach
uuuhm that s terrifying and i wish i hadn t seen it at night thank youuu
the cockroach s antenna are still twitching after it is decapitated
this feel so snuff
fuckkkkk turn it off and dont watch
why does this strike me as being cruel
that head was twitching for a while
hey she eats the legs like people
yeah bb you getta that cockaroach
cockroaches preying mantis and termites are all from the same super order so it s a lot like humans eating other primate s something something mantis eats cockroach world i guess
i kinda want to barf now
i ve been bitten by a praying mantis once it hurts
this was so satisfying to watch as someone with a german roach infestation
he loves the legs but hates the meaty bits
he slashes at you with this a six inch retractable claw like a razor on the the middle toe he doesn t bother to bite your jugular like a lion say no no he slashes at you here or here or maybe across the belly spilling your intestines the point is you are alive when they start to eat you
that isn t prey there was no hunt that is just food
om om om
that s like a meal at olive garden you eat the bread legs and you get the salad head and you feel content then the fettuccine body comes and you eat half of it then throw the rest in the take out box in shame and disgust because you just ate a 5th of your body weight
i regret my life choices by watching this
so theres parts of a roach even mantis wont eat interesting
how does something eat something 4th its own size or better that s crazy
i want a regular speed version of this this shit is interesting
thank goodness it didn t eat the poopy bits
man i be smackin burritos the same way
i will never forget this moment
damn it really enjoys mleming the shit out of this roach
ok who sped it up
taste like chicken
it prefers the crunchy bits
bro even licked his fingers
damn he ate that entire thing imagine just eating a entire person causally
finger licking good
i always suspected praying mantis to be bulimic but dang i was wrong when i witnessed it lick it s chops
he really licked his fingers at the end
i recommend buying a packet of praying mantis and ladybugs at your local feed store to release into your garden they mostly stay away from each other but they do a good job cleaning
note to self do not make these bigger
no leaving the table until you eat your last bite
that was one hungry mother fucker
tastes like chicken
can you imagine that thing tall be like starship troopers
finger licking good
i feel like this is how it looks watching people eat crab legs
you can tell it likes the crunchy bits best like going for the edge brownies first
mesmerizing kinda weird how fascinating this is
it s like a reversed 3d printer
tastes like chicken
how cruel are we to watch that
that was nightmare fuel

for anyone curious this is ganoderma applanatum or artist s conk this is an especially gigantic specimen these are somewhat prized because carvings can be made in the white part on the bottom which exposes the dark brown tissue beneath the spores and creates vivid shaded lines which become permanent when dried because of this they can be used to make fairly permanent pieces of art thus the name artist s conk
years of playing mario make me think that thing would be bouncy if i jump on it

the wealthy loved hitler until he invaded czechoslovakia charles lindbergh was also a big fan as was prescott bush father and grandfather of us presidents
duke of windsor he abdicated in december
today we see hitler as an absolute monster but it s wild to think that before ww2 he was seen as just another average leader of a country who did official foreign visits had many supporters outside of germany met with diplomats and leaders of different countries etc people just didn t realize how much of a monster he was holocaust ww2 all of that was yet to happen
and people were having handshakes with putin in
and somehow people still support them
source https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-35765793.amp
wallis markle
hitler cared about his people and nazi germany had the highest levels of animal welfare compared even to this day
all three of them have that look on their faces what the fuck am i doing here
partners in crime
time s man of the year before he became a villain
look at these traitorous cunts
nazi cowards
wallace apparently had ties to several high ranking nazi officials including ribbentrop
did hitler have black hair look at how much darker hitler s hair is compared to edward s even with black and white imaging you can still see that hitler s hair was cleary very dark
kewl
which country did edward come from
and thats why the current monarchs are windsors
all the best people supported hitler eddie 8th prince bernard prescott bush george soros
how does he look to be gigabalding at the first picture but then normal at the 2nd just weird lighting cameras or what
he was on a tour of nazi germany i think he knew damn well why he was there
https://www.criterion.com/films/28895-come-and-see
ed say adolf what s all this wanting to invade poland thing i keep hearing about adolf naaa all good pal just shits giggles
three cunts
i know it s probably knowing what he did and maybe it was kinda the look back then for some but he just looks evil
and henry ford was a personal pen pal
i heard that too its common to think hitler was propped up by poor folk like farmers but rich people in germany also loved him due to his denouncement of communism
it s like the wealthy and fascists share the same air and space
he was pretty popular everywhere until the czech invasion the us national socialist party was quite large and had very big events
coco channel was a nazi sympathizer and informer and actually ran missions out of love for hitler and all things antisemitic one of her lovers was a high ranking nazi officer she designed clothing for them hugo boss puma adidas other clothing companies formed by hitler loving antisemites the car companies are a whole other story
new york times wrote he s not a real anti semite in 1920s
people see him as a monster today
don t ask british crown family about rudolf hess btw brittain is a motherland of racism country that performed many genocydes india africa and massacres all over the worls country that built first concentation camps in the workls to keep torture and murder africaaners wifes and childrens during bur s war
he was essentially exiled due to how immensely unpopular he was in the uk some people support the monarchy for romantic reasons some support a constitutional monarchy because they believe the benefits outweigh the negatives a growing number do not support them at all
they just wanted their privacy too
time s man of the year was just the person who had the biggest influence on the world it s not necessarily praise
edward viii was a windsor himself he was the uncle of queen elizabeth the name windsor comes much earlier into play when the royal family wanted to cut ties with its german roots in the time of ww1 they changed from saxe coburg and gotha to windsor
george soros was in he was seven in
yeah the anti semitism was too much for him to resist
he was supported by conservatives because he would attack liberals both rhetorically and physically and they thought they could control him remind you of anything
and beliefs
nazi rally at madison square garden https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_nazi_rally_at_madison_square_garden)
let me tell you about the us space program
the american nazi party sold out madison square garden too
don t confuse modern countries with the historical development of countries please
oh i didn t know what the thinking and thought process was behind that award in the s lucky we have you to tell us the truth
gonna upset your apple cart https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npvhhgztsxo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npvhhgztsxo)
take my very angry upvote accurate though
sure does
there were so very many left right center groups hitler opposed when he first got involved with the german workers party aka dap it was a very poor group fixated on building their ranks through the working class that s where this idea comes from hitler was interested in power and that s it i d wager that if it appealed to groups to blame it on blonde blue eyed children he d have had them wiped out that s the similarity to trump bin laden and many other leaders they don t actually believe these specify groups or ideologies are important other than to use as a uniting scapegoat it s just a way to coerce a strong base of supporters to become fanatical that s part of the tragedy it s the followers that made hitler powerful not him as some magical demon he was a great orator and weaved a diabolical web to keep acquiring power while feeding the nationalistic monster group he kept feeding it more and more groups to expand that base but in the end what group wasn t targeted by the nazis he himself wasn t even an aryan it was just some bs idea to keep the fanatics going and breed more nationalism
not really
a party on the left that shoves their bullshit down everyones throat yeah it does sound familiar
ahh good ol fashion contrast bias
calling hitler right wing lmao left authoritarian bucko
his anti liberal rhetoric became popular because the weimar republic turned its back on sexual abuse of children by deviants and the sexualization of minors in photography films and advertisements feel familiar at all
yep beyond pale that and eugenics being taught at the highest level in the us
britain s still quite filled with racists regardless of their historical development
tell that to us citizens
the daughter of person who used chemical weapons agains curds was their queen until latest times different country you say lol
this reads as sarcasm but it literally was the thinking however time magazine points out that controversial figures such as adolf hitler joseph stalin nikita khrushchev and ayatollah khomeini have also been granted the title for their impact on events
with what telling me george soros wasn t born in
that s where this idea comes from hitler was interested in power and that s it i d wager that if it appealed to groups to blame it on blonde blue eyed children he d have had them wiped out that really ignores years of antisemitism this didn t just happen it wasn t random
this is pseudo historical nonsense hitler had advocated for unification of german people since he was a boy wanting to become an artist even when his father would beat him for espousing such beliefs according to pretty much everyone who knew him early in life he also had long been a big anti semite and all of his personal letters and writings confirm much of his firm beliefs there were still plenty of things he made up for popularity like german christianity when privately he despised christianity but in general he was totally a nazi
you re an idiot and probably a fascist if you even knew what that meant
you really are stupid fascism is an extremist nationalistic right wing philosophy if you get your ged you may learn that
you re a liar and a fascist propagandist plenty of nazis were known pedophiles but they were protected while anyone who wasn t a straight christian nazi supporter was demonized homosexuals had to wear pink triangles and were sent to extermination camps
feel familiar at all repress everyone you disagree with on sexual morality or the jews get it yeah it feels familiar this time you fuckers will have a much tougher fight
oh it really isn t and you have no basis or evidence for that claim
er yes england of is different to the england of obviously
didn t watch it when asked if soros was sorry for throwing in with the nazis he replied no it was the best time of my life spend minutes and learn a little life lesson there sparky
it wasn t random antisemitism was extremely popular did you not notice how it grew from exterminating jews to basically every other group point being is they were a means to an end he wasn t some magical villain he attached himself to hate and rode it for all it s worth so in that sense you re seeing the similarity with charismatic leaders
this was in response to the idea he was just a conservative like i m assuming trump or any other american conservative it doesn t exactly hold water hitler was against a lot more groups than liberals including exactly other conservatives and eventually literally every group that opposes the nazis was my point
i just gave you facts from the guy himself you re the one taking little half truths and anecdotes the nationalism antisemite nonsense was exactly what drew him to the workers party the point as he s stated over and over was just like germany he needed a group to blame and power power was what he was after and the antisemite sentiments were a means to an end sure
does the truth hurt
you fuckers as if i cant be a liberal but self aware enough to recognize that society is obviously trying yo sexualize minors and introduce children to sex at a far too young an age its sad that you are so un self aware that you cannot take any lessons from history theres a reason the nsdap became popular at the end of the weimar republic and it was primarily based on socio cultural issues rather than economic as their competition offered much of the same exact economical agendas as they did if you dont want another hitler you should probably actually look into what exactly made him so popular it wasn t just blaming everything on the jews his ideas were immensely popular worldwide during the transitional period between wwi wwii
the dame political system the same high class families genetically different from all other population rulling the same society system still no constitution and no citizanship the only difference is that it have no colonies anymore but still habe plans to get them back
you didn t give me any facts from the guy himself what are you talking about lol i don t think you even read what i wrote before he had any ambitions beyond being an artist he was a virulent anti semite who argued for germanic dominance that never changed since he was a kid as soon as ww1 ended he blamed the jews and joined a broke powerless party that aligned with his beliefs if he was after only power he would ve gone to like a dozen other places first all personal writings of his confirms he firmly believed the basics of nazism he wrote about things that definitely were never meant to become public like hating religion especially christianity so we know he wasn t writing for the approval of the public he authentically believed in what he wrote there s just no evidence hitler was only after power it s kind of an absurd claim all things considered even if it sounds like a nice answer to you
no but your stupidity is giving me a headache also whenever someone says shoved down everyone s throat i know i m dealing with a closet case it s ok you can admit you have feelings for other men and you can stop resenting women
i agree society does sexualize minors through child beauty pageants what is being done about those
everyone is genetically different what do you mean no citizenship we do have a constitution it s just not written down and changes with the times and is based on parliamentary sovereignty rule of law democracy and upholding international law the supreme court oversees the uncodified constitution some would argue that s better than a written constitution unchanged in centuries the uk does still have colonies they re just called overseas territories which plans are these to get them back
no the culture of the country has changed significantly
genetically different from all other population are you nuts
you seem upset
plenty of people were complaining when honey booboo was a thing where were you
like who republicans massive protests in the streets

year before that one stranger mission in rdr2 takes place
i wish tesla got more funding dude really was a super genius
not sure which one is a bigger flex
one of the most intelligent people to ever live
a rdr2 side mission references this episode
invents radio control uses it for pranks lovely
to the ignorant science will always seem like magic
this guy had the most spectacular photo taken out of any scientist of his time sitting right in the middle of electricity cage chad
this has to be the closest any human has ever felt to being a time traveler or having alien technology
years later just call it ai and have people chat with it now everyone thinks it s smart too
so glad he was alive after the medieval times that man would have been burned at the stake
if this man was alive today he would be treated even worse
he wasn t rich but he did have his dominance over those that were
like everything else tesla on the internet this is a lie tesla did not invent radio control that was possibly ernest wilson and c j evans and they even did remote control boats first attributing everything to tesla takes away from the names of those that actually invented these things ironically what people think they re fighting against

radio control was invented by john hays hammond jr not to say that tesla did not pull the trick but he did not invent radio control
chads root for tesla losers for the thief edison
has anyone here played red dead redemption i think this was partly acted out in one of the missions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tnmndzq8tq
well arguably you could argue that the adueince indeed did control the boat by shouting commands just not directly tesla functoined as a command reciever and converter for the boat converting all the shouts into radio signal for the boats its a direct conversion from crowd singal to boat executiion

stop telling me about this guy and any scientists for that matter
he looks weirdly like ralf finnes
people believed he put some small people in there and told them what to do just like some people thought when they ve seen the tvs for the first time ik radio is crazy as an invention but man who wouldn t want small people to exist
through a combination of the thumbnail and lazy reading i for some reason thought this post was about freddie mercury i had to do a double take when it said he invented radio control
what a madlad in a good way obv
it s a toy boat
how the fuck can you invent rc man some people are smart well done that guy
that s what i do with the garage opener and my year old
yes the one in saint denis with marko dragic his laboratory looks a lot like wardenclyffe tower also
i knew that i knew it from somewhere now i remember thanks
i always read rdr2 as r2d2 and i concoct some reason how the line might make sense
well he probably would have if he was concerned with profit and not trying to give everyone in the world free energy
capitalism really fucked him over
bo a th
yup https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tnmndzq8tq
dunno ai is getting pretty weird mate
years from now will be wild there s a netflix show called altered carbon set far into the future that uses a lot of ai in everyday life first season is worth the watch
tesla had a patent issued on however he did it
this man has credited to so many things only by people on the internet we use in our daily lives and most don t know his name to be fair it s other people that invented almost all of those things
i think almost everyone knows his name from the car tesla of course
people use emojis as shortcuts to words you used a longer expression to refer to the shortcut for a shorter word
what an incredibly dumb comment
yeah if only he was a greedy sleezy covergirl
frankly it s shocking that he was allowed to live
you know he burned through the fortune he had right if you were to adjust his salary to today s prices when he was working at westinghouse he was making a month who he also sold million worth of patents to capitalism was the reason who could afford to go on and invest in his own ideas and projects
if you don t understand it sure i guess that s how those people yelling at the boat felt
piping in to second altered carbon being a great show at first haha watch the second season with the same caution as game of thrones season or just leave it at the first season lol
i watched it i wasn t too impressed the story was hard to get into movie ai is better than real lol i watched it though solely because it was one of the first shows in dolby vision and i wanted to test out my tv
ernest wilson and c j evans received uk patent no entitled improvements in methods of steering torpedoes and submarine boats on march tesla receive u s patent method of and apparatus for controlling mechanism of moving vehicle or vehicles on july 1st these were made possible by the work of english physicist oliver lodge on a mechanical radio frequency rf detector
deleted
so in terms of r d he was actually not getting much of anything super impressive how much he got done with that little a year
to most of us that s a lot of money but considering how he changed our world that s kind of a pittance
was just a passing comment i do understand ai it s fascinating technology and i stand by that it s arguably more complicated and alien than a primitive rc car you smug cunt
yeah cool tesla has five or six remote control patents i have a copy of his complete patent works that doesn t mean he invented it just a different detector method probably but just like edison and the light bulb tesla gets some recognition for it because he marketed it first
what s the capital of alabama no googling ofc
for the things that he did just by himself for sure however plenty of his r d was financed by people such as j p morgan which is how he got wardenclyffe before it burned down
might get downvoted but he had a lot of financing don t try rewriting history to say tesla didn t have a chance to explore invention because he absolutely did nikola tesla was an ardent supporter of capitalism and has spoken in the past of his pessimism towards large federal governance the individual will not be permitted to achieve great wealth and power his privacy will be invaded in a thousand ways he will be restricted in his efforts in every direction will virtually disappear in the wave of collectivism which will sweep the world
he could have gotten more but he tore up multiple contracts if he wouldn t have done this his relatives would more than likely be getting billions a year https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/in-1897-nikola-tesla-tore-up-a-contract-that-would-have-made-him-the-worlds-first-billionaire/) from them money was such a non issue for him that he did things like that only later perhaps did he realize he wasn t great with money amazing man but not great with financial planning
for sure ai in would have been much more impressive than radio command however is ai today more allieny than radio command back then
deleted
can t say i know the specifics of teslas life too well and im honestly mostly impressed withhow much he got done with so little i am definently not here to fight for socialism right now
good question hard to say we re so exposed to tech it s taking astronomical feats to make our heads turn that said at large i really don t think lots of average people are comprehending the scale of the impact ai technology s will have and i would say largely lots of people don t actually understand much of it from general lack of exposure not a lack of ability to do so it might seem like old news on reddit but reddit is nowhere near representative of the average person and people on here act like it s true reality i would say that current ai is equally as alieny as rc was back then but access to means of understanding it and communicating that information is much more widespread consider this was the first display of rc with no explanation that s like giving a normal person a sophisticated ai chat bot with no explanation when no other similar technology has ever existed that said those are not the circumstances so i suppose in this case the rc is more alien in that context but i would say overall i believe that a functional artificial intelligence is more instinctively alien to me on a human level
nice job but do you feel like that knowledge makes you kinder or a better member of society
haha i m not trying to fight for capitalism either just pointing out his beliefs truth be told i m not sure whether he had a lot of capital or a bit of it and more importantly i don t have a great frame of reference outside of edison for whether it was comparative to the time and roles they respectively had they don t grow on trees lol

i am always impressed by the amount of time and forethought that goes into something with so many layers that all need to work together perfectly unreal
i want to fill my library with these so every time a book lover comes over and gets excited enough they feel like i pulled the rug from under them
and the bidding starts at
amazing i haven t the patience for this work
impressive
great work
this is beautiful
who has this much patience
um ok
seriously who has this much free time is this just a past time or is this this person s job and if the latter how can they possibly make a living if just a past time i really wonder how long this took
that s is cool
isobelle has to be autistic
so awesome but i just would not have the patience
i hope so given how many hours went into this no lazer cutting in sight

the closest known galaxy to us is the canis major dwarf galaxy at km light years from the sun the sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy is the next closest at km light years from the sun the andromeda galaxy is the closest big galaxy to our milky way at million light years
what s crazy to me is that since it was founded in all of the miss universe winners have been from the milky way it s like the other galaxies aren t even trying
honestly i actually thought it was more
where banana
imma sitting here wondering where they got that photo from
what is that a galaxy for ants
i think about this sometimes in as much as my tiny human brain can have any idea of this type of scale and then i remember that our solar system isn t moving through space like the little diagrams we see it s flying through space as a giant moving corkscrew of planets whirling around a central sun never having been in the same place twice or ever visiting it again
there s no fucking way we re the only ones
so much room for activities
here s a dumb question i ve never heard answers for can there be a lone star out in space not belonging to any galaxy
that s a whole lotta nothing
but my opinion is the most important thing in the universe
i wonder what all of this is
now do next closest solar system
even traveling at the speed of light it would still take thousand years to get to the closest galaxy x200b maybe thats why we havnt been killed yet good luck surviving the aliens that had the earliest head start we are fodder x200b we need to get the ai up and ready b4 the chinese and then do a spherical degree spawn in all directions in various distances spreading humanity ai out and then each spawn does the same sphere spread like cosmic seeds
so you re saying there s a chance
which is the one with the dingle berry
how many parsecs
what is the little dot by andromeda
i don t see a banana how are we supposed to know the scale if there s no banana
yea that is just crazy even in pop culture sci fi the galaxy is still their largest unit of traversable space star trek s alpha beta gamma delta quadrants are within the milky way galaxy voyager was supposed to take like years at warp 125x the speed of light just to get from one quadrant to another i m sure there is some sci fi that goes this distance mass effect andromeda is all i can think of and that is even more insane after seeing this
i think it s amazing we were able to get this picture
the distance my grandparents have to cross just to make it to school when they were still students
i e r e a l l y freaking far
so like inches sweet
damn they re moving slowly collision in billion years millions of years per pixel dust in the wind and all that
that s how far my grandparents had to walk to school
ahh i see you ve added a banana to scale as well thank you good sir
hmmm and yet they are already starting to touch https://newatlas.com/space/andromeda-halo-hubble-milky-way-collision/
no banana for scale
will the cameraman make it home safely
doesn t look that far haha weird because it s unfathomably far can t help but think we can t be the only intelligent life in the universe
uses fingers but that s only like this far
i thought it was cool putting a dot to show where earth is then i realized it was a piece of dust also we are inside the galaxy all this post taught me is that i m dumber than i thought
still on a collision course
we chillin
and yet they re bound to collide
so many washing machines can fit in that just wow
what i don t get is if we are in the milky way how can we capture it like it is there
so if i m not mistaken all that space between galaxies is just a vast void of black nothingness there is nothing until you reach andromeda or milky way that s kinda scary and crazy ngl now i get the universe being empty space
can you post another one with banana for scale
i thought this was one of those gifs that zooms in and out to show you the size difference i stared at it for longer than i d like to admit before i realized it was just a picture
won t you beee my neighbor hello neighbor
all that space and the council still denied my extension
suprisingly its too close more or less inches
i bet i can hit it with this here rock
that space in between that s where the dragons are
out of interest op how did you take this photo
should it be a little brighter andromeda would shine like a persistent yet silent and eerie eye in the night
space
that can t be to scale you dummy or we couldn t see it maybe or but not to scale to scale means equal if not you would say to what of scale
roughly million years of travel tword each other at current speeds
now make it a gif where they get closer until they collide at seconds in and then it will be to scale at a speed of second per million years
i hope one day we get a closer look at andromeda
what is that little star looking thing that s on the outside is the one on the right
a days hike for a guy like me
still can t comprehend the distance the harder i focus the more it seems like we re inches away from another galaxy
that must be another level of nothing between them
so what s in between
so pretty close
damn an inch and a half crazy
its here grab onto something
damn didn t know they were so close
ol
so it s like far
calling uber galactica
scaled to what lol
voyager is still en route
and we re supposed to crash into each other
so there are only stars in galaxies right is space empty in between galaxies
ok phew lots of time to panic
so like this is just theory
is that really to scale i feel like andromeda would look much larger when loooing at it from earth
so thumbs what u think im stupid or sumthin
thank you for this studying space with my son for homeschool he ll love this
going to need a banana for scale
still need a banana for scale
i mean i know that s like really far but from this perspective it doesn t seem like that much
it s funny because people think this is a real picture
is this to scale
it s kinda close but also really far
wait four billion years and they will be a lot closer
it s coming right for us
to scale so about inch and a quarter
how did we take the photo
i guess the on foot scale is beyond imagination
they re gonna crash
sorry needs a banana
need banana for scale
need banana for true scale
two and a half inches nah bigger bro
where s the banana
you can see my house from here
where is banan
ahhhh okay that helps put things into perspective i get it now
fake news i would take millions of lightyears to travel this far
an ever expanding distance
could someone please add a banana for scale i m struggling to grasp the distance
walking distance

too large and open i prefer the final product as it allowed for more shafts that s the problem with the new alien movies it s always in large open areas that try to show off how well they were built with this sence of grandeur alien should be claustrophobic
i remember in high school there was always this one kid who was sitting in the back drawing these diagrams in his backpack you d find the star trek bible the blueprints for the enterprise d magic the gathering cards and a tin full of various multisided dice
love it it has got so much days to learn from and replicate be it an emerging professional or any hobbyist it should be fun to draw
that one dude who has to sit sideways for some reason
before alien and maybe after too ronn cobb was notorious for his viciously biting editorial cartoons for the underground los angeles free press freep weekly paper then he got to design alien and conan kewl and better paying
i read this in the comic book guy voice
yeah i remember this from a behind the scenes documentary they thought this design was too star trek and reworked it taking inspiration from a lancaster bomber cockpit with switches and panels filling every available space
kid sounds dope as hell
were you going thru his backpack after you finished beating him up
nah i borrowed the blueprints to map an optimal route between the main and battle bridge via the jefferies tubes

it s mainly do to the fact that everyone would ve wanted to vote no on it so they just didn t and went ahead with it anyways that would piss me off too
there are palm trees in paris
i like how they added in the audio of a soccer crowd chanting to make it seem like it was some massive demonstration when in reality it s just four dudes doing this on some empty street
i m an american so can someone explain this concept of retirement that seems to be making a lot of people very upset
and the german language sign
say what you want about the french but they know how to hold their government accountable
hanged just wanted to say hanged paintings and coats get hung persons get hanged
doesn t look like paris at all
i m in paris rn and this doesn t look like it s paris tbh seem to be another smaller city
i would have went with the classic french guillotine
sooo a lynch mob
jeez its here
they are right in stopping this bullshit right in the beginning in germany they are discussing raising the retirement age to this happens when people stay silent
that s not paris it s in lorient in brittany
they should of used a guillotine
wait til they raise it to after realizing that they cannot fund it at any longer shits gonna get wild
scheisse
you ve got to admire the dedication what is retirement in the us now about
in belgium they raised it to nobody did of say anything that s why i am moving abroad
shouldn t they be using a guillotine
retiring at would be nice
if i was understanding it correctly from a different post they also removed the option for manual labor jobs like garbage men and such to retire early
am finnish and i ain t getting retired till these baby ass number changes this is a joke please do not take it seriously
why are the signs in german if this is supposed to be paris
wauw if i could only retire at i m going to have to wait until i m
however angry you are at your president this form of protest is not adequate to the situation it is a unpleasant policy but not a warcrime so insinuating hanging just reflects badly on protesters
why give people an option to vote on it seems stupid it s not like people are informed on the topic look at brexit
margaret thatcher put it well the trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people s money
i mean with average life spans increasing literally year by year increasing the retirement age by years is almost too little i think it s like or where i live pension payouts by governments are already insanely high in many countries increasing working age a little bit increase from to is much better than increasing taxes by billions to compensate
no one in the group has a job or is even of retirement age
meanwhile in usa we will be worked until death
looking at american age to retire and seeing it s x200b sigh
i swear its only the french people who will get upset by a year raise come to my country we work until we are and they raised it or times without asking the people thats just how it is i think the french people are overreacting just a little bit
cringe
in the u s if you were born after your age to get social security is at age they raised the social security age gradually for those born in and after in month increments see the ssa article https://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/incretage.html](https://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/incretage.html) remember there is no government that makes money taxpayers are the funding for the government when there isn t enough workers to fund the pensions through deductions then something will break the growing s of retirees in all countries are causing a funding shortage the rolling stones said it right you can t always get what you want
france is the wussiest country on the planet
people just dont understand that we have no choice retirement need to be raised in all europe
why is it such a big deal its only years more i guess my young ass doesn t get it can someone explain why they are angry
where in the usa it s now years when social security was established in the us the retirement age was while life expectancy was while it fell slightly during covid the life expectancy is still much higher than i suspect math in france is similar so with gdp growth that hasn t been great in years though currently well above germany and slightly above italy and a hour work week and with small businesses essentially unable to fire the unperforming somehow paris is supposed to conjure up a change that makes everyone able to retire at there are two options retire in poverty at or hyperinflation anyone seen argentina recently
aristo aristo a la lanterne
come on guys is that really necessary that s messed up i can t say much as one of the us of a s female comedians held up a severed head of then president trump it was a career ending stunt trump derangement syndrome tds is real maybe there is a macron derangement syndrome mds too
see what happens when you take away progs free sh
can you hear the people sing singing the songs of angry men
is the retirement age in the usa and they re talking about making it
i mean people get older on average and the amount of young people cant support the growing amount of retirees but obviously nobody wants to work years longer so their parents dont fall into retiree poverty because people only want benefits for them and not for the society they live in
such a dumb reason
maybe elect the other candidate next time
a bit extreme
tough titty
what do you mean the government isn t going to pay me full time to do nothing how dare they at the same time how did the government rack up such a massive deficit i don t understand
the french have always been the best at sending a strong message when it come to revolution over things we as americans just fucking accept kinda sad but i sorta envy the french for that they don t take no shit
this is how you end up with le pen as prime minister
its absolutely insane how the french revolution the one from the 1800s not shaped the entire globe and is celebrated for it but if that happened today we would be horrified by an entire class of people being hung or decapitated
almost everywhere in the world the retirement age is so shut up already
they have a guaranteed retirement age i think we just have a few benefits here in the us and they dont even kick in till youre
woah hanging is our thing america cutting off heads is ya lls thing
cries in german as we have a retirement age of already the question is if the the people who are against it can offer a better solution to longterm demographic change and people getting older
hilarious the us government has done this twice to us now from to and now to unfortunately though here we only protest over political party distractions the no exactly how to distract us
very reminiscent of parts of the middle east during my early teen years i don t know how else to say it but cultures are bifurcating before our eyes and i don t see a peaceful remedy any time soon scary times
politics in france should be considered an extreme sport must be stressful wondering what bad step you might take and people start oiling up the guillotine
really immature people what do they expect to be done the liabilities are unfunded some measures have to be taken
i love the french people so much
americans need to take notes this is the only way you show your government you want change unfortunately complaining on reddit and twitter doesn t accomplish much student loans healthcare weed the war on drugs mass surveillance illegal wars corporate lobbying housing on and on and on
its in ny retirement as well lol we are europe
government everywhere seems to be regressing instead of advancing
let s do this in america now
if you protest what macron did you are an idiot
first world issues lol
comments here are quite uninformed and disgusting right wing americans always seem to know what s best for everyone don t they
i wonder how many of those protesters actually work
retirement age just gone up to age in australia i would love
come on america stop being bitches
so spoiled
fuck those pansy ass socialist french napoleon was the only frenchmen with any balls want to sit on their ass and get government handouts
say what you will about france they basically perfected protesting
i m really starting to think we re being lied to as usual and these protests are about far more substantial issues than just the single issue of raising the retirement age by two years most of these protesters are very far from retirement age i don t see that one issue causing such a sustained uproar among the younger generations they really seem to want macron done away with what are their non retirment related complaints i m sick of the media trying to tell me what a protest is about i want to hear it from those directly involved and protesting not some convenient tiny summary from the media
what s next the cent price hike on stamps sheesh
poor guy had no feet
off with their heads
came for the guillotining stayed for the hanging in effigy
hanged
just like old times now its making me old
uhm who s explosion
what is this retirement you speak of
you would think the french upper class would ve learned from history
hmm french are doing french stuff
just wait until they move to the us and it s worth no chance of having money to retire at
i was a week from retirement and the gov said sike
yeah here in the us we haven t seen much media coverage on the protests by design i m sure it s only a matter of time before they do this to us
you should be able to retire as soon as you have the money to
make them work more than hours per week and let s see what happens
the french really are a pair of fucking pussies my god
macron pushed this thru parliament without passing it through the house he just bi passed the parliament that is what fascism is an autocrat the french are holding firm its not about the retirment age but the act of lawlessness by this dictator they must not let him win or democracy will fall
go france
i have no sympathy or understanding for this behaviour it s like shooting yourself in the foot in slow motion
seems like that s a bit much
i love how everyone involved is under and the change doesn t impact them at all
unintentionally causing deaf people to duck and jump back when they see the explosion sign
in the us it s

that s ice all right
frozen water
really disappointed i dug and couldn t find some smart person explaining why it froze that way
i ve never heard a skylight called a roof window before it actually makes much more sense
that s not ice it s  
crop it down to just the ice and make a 10x10 print that would look pretty cool framed
nice you tapped into the realm of jotunheim how fortunate you are to witness one of the branches of yggdrasil
technically frost is frozen water vapor deposited via sublimation not condensation source am meterolo meteoroli weather guy
oh that s cool i thought it was a design in the glass for a second
wow that s so cool
it s like looking up through a tree so beautiful it reminds of a book i read years ago called the hidden messages in water by masaru emoto
wow nature can be beautiful
op s first language isn t even english he she tried sharing something nice for you twats to see and you re just picking on the title which is funny because i m sure that at least half of the commenters don t know a 2nd language or even master their mother tongue this is why we can t have nice things
fractal
fractal growth pattern
could post in r natureisfuckinglit
makes me uncomfortable for some reason looks cool though
lovely patern
the way that crystals form can substantially affect the strength of metals and i find that fascinating good example of crystallization here
that s a skylight my dude
wow this is gorgeous thank you for sharing
crystalized dihydrogen monoxide
not sure why but that image gives me anxiety
i m at the point with technology ai where i don t trust pictures anymore i m disgusted and amazed at the same time not saying this isn t real but everything draws the skeptic out of me now damnit ps this is beautiful
frozen dihydrogen monoxide
praise the erdtree
photos like this are great cropped and printed on canvas i have a photo of congealing fat from fried meat that looks like an abstract painting this would too
all these years i ve been calling them skylights man i must have sounded dumb
beautiful thanks for sharing
drugs
absolutely beautiful
endlessforms mostbeautiful
this title has me rolling
lalique
a lot of digital sculptors will use an image like this to create displacement maps to use as textures on 3d models
water that has been cooled until it became a solid as it appears on the glass viewing receptacle in the wall above my head in my living space
ice on my skylight
aka ice
if only there was a word for frozen water oh well
ice right
looks like ice on your skylight to me
you mean ice
why call it frozen water when you could have just called it solid water
ice is what they call it
in the place i grew up we called those sky lights
you mean thin layer of ice on skylight
that is called ice
so ice
what if there was like a word for frozen water like frowater
skylight
roof window that s a new one lol also frozen water xd
spoken ice yes
if that s what frozen water looks like i can only imagine melted water
your roof has a window daaaaang lucky
kewl
skylight
looks like dick veins
deleted
that s not frozen water that s actual ics bro made with real girl scouts
that s awesome
beautiful
it s jack frost
trippy
it s like a pretty necrinomicon
i wanna lick it
aw dammit elsa forgot her gloves again
how can people look at an image like this and say there s no flying spaghetti monster look at the beautiful spaghetti like shapes my god is amazing
pretty pretty
minecraft irl
wow
your art is the most beautiful art of all the art
i m stealing this picture to make a new texture brush in my art app because that s a nice looking texture
this looks incredible and like something from the start of an ai generated horror movie
nature s qr code
was it a good break
it s pure beauty
wow
ice worm infestation
that s so cool
this looks like the style of painting i do nature is so rad
nice pattern
i love the different patterns water makes so fucking cool
same here on my loft windows and my car
looks like a weld job
sehr kalt und schn
that s gorgeous
also sunshine on your shoulder
that is really cool really
did you check the garage or the cat hold
that s a beautiful pattern
why is part of it clear the surrounding area
this is clearly the imprint of where a shoggoth landed in the middle of the night
do a charcoal rubbing of it would make a beautiful meaningful piece to hang inside your warm cozy home
nature was generous printing that piece of art
it looks like carved crystal so pretty
i had some gas water coming out of my kettle this morning
it s called ice it s called a skylight
are you sure that s not mycelium and we re all not tripping on mushrooms

tree bark produces oils which are drawn to the surface of the bark in warm dry weather when it rains these ingredients dissolve in the water and flow down the tree trunks they start to bond chemically and create soap molecules https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2022-05-13/outside-inbox-what-is-that-white-foam-that-forms-on-the-trees-when-it-rains).

the close up of this tree took me back to my childhood in south texas climbing pecan trees they were the best to climb because they had so many strong branches with spots to hang out on they were the worst to climb because that bark was so jagged and hard you d get so scratched up climbing one of those bad boys but it was worth it

bro found a nametag from a dungeon
so was it relatively similar
because it s archeology and why would additional funding to save our planet be a bad thing
that is maybe the stupidest fucking thing i ve read all day and of course from a person who doesn t know shit about anything studying climate attempt to get funding to study climate change what a fucking moron you are
they dont think its money going to saving the climate they think its just some guy getting his pockets lined they think they feel they ignore evidence and call everything a scam

but i was told facts don t care about feelings by them at a high volume
know
i am a scientist

they are not interested in climate change but in how the climate was during the ptolomaic and the roman era in egypt understanding these climatic effects can help us understand how humans in that era lived and developed during that time understanding the climate at specific times which this is a perfect method for since the wooden notes are dated helps us to understand climatic catastrophes that happened during that time and how the affected humans survived or lived with them it can help us understand how a culture like egypt which mainly survived on aggriculture survived long droughts or massive rainfalls you however just saw climate and stopped thinking there

yes by the scientists who are cited in the meta analysis that op linked here you go it s open access read it yourself https://brill.com/view/journals/ijwc/aop/article-10.1163-27723194-bja10017/article-10.1163-27723194-bja10017.xml). you clearly didn t your so called buzzword is mentioned once in the acknowlegments in the sentence this work was carried out as part of a post doctoral fellowship at the university of geneva within the snsf project the roman egypt laboratory climate change societal transformations and the transition to late antiquity

wheres the guy in the van hes supposed to be here
i guess you could say they re moulin rogues
okay so what s the story
why are they walking like a bunch of low level bad guys in a video game though
well that s not very nice of them
they lookin for some poor sob
it s ok they re just performing a social media prank
you should probably call the police rather than posting it on reddit
i thought guns were illegal there
they don t look very organized
the veil of civility is very thin
purge siren
very interesting not pros did not move with purpose and the hoods first guy holds ak wrong looks like some long barrel pistols and one submachine gun don t seem overly concerned with standing out in public
it s okay it is just a rap video
guns and protests are one way of solving pension issues another one was identifying the issues years ago getting a parlament wide compromise after much debate and expert input and gradually over time adjust the pensions so that it would be sustainable in the future as well one country was france the other norway since pension age is already in norway the french method seems to work best
not protesters drugs in nice france in the moulins district drug trafficking is part of the daily lives of residents recently videos showing heavily armed men in the nice neighborhood have circulated on social networks https://www.tellerreport.com/news/2023-04-04-in-nice--the-moulins-district-is-plagued-by-drug-trafficking.bjebc2ef-2.html
waiting room for the map too open up
i had a very good time in nice a million years ago
those are misrepresented refugees
those aren t french people
france has become a hellhole source i ve been going there for decades but after my last few trips i ll never go again i genuinely felt unsafe almost the entire time last few trips
r idiotswithguns
how very nice
more migration please
france should have some sort of gun control
diversity
that s kids with airsofts in france you can buy repliqua for pretty cheap yes it could be real guns too but use your brain just a bit none of them look above
immigrants
spotted regular texas subway patrons
in the us we call that wednesday
thought this was tlou2 footage
interesting af not really
they re probably just getting ready to surrender them
in america we call this going for a walk
i thought guns were banned there
weird guns are illegal there i thought that was outlawed that shouldn t be happening s
impossible thats a gun free zoneee
deleted
it s a grime music vid
i thought the cia was supposed to stop operating in us allies soil
i thought guns were illegal in france
fuckn immigrants doing what they have always done traumatised as kids viva la france
they should make guns illegal there
why is this iaf
they re going moulin rogue
they look like generic npc baddies walking around guarding a random street corner
they look like airsofters who didn t have appropriate clothing for a rainy game day
i d have to fight the immense urge to just walk up to them and ask if there s like a danger etc despite knowing that there s like a chance i d get a gun pulled one me logically thinking if they d want to shoot randoms or just people amidst the protest they probably would ve already and from what i ve seen the citizens aren t the ones to be scared of unless you side with the government
i got robbed in nice in a nice part of town in broad daylight apparently it happens to tourists regularly a distant cousin of mine was murdered there too if you re considering visiting don t below the picturesque veneer lies a large seedy underbelly
france s stance on immigration refugees has destroyed the nation and its most certainly not going to get any better same goes for several other european nations but hey at least they did the right thing
playing airsoft maybe
proof gun control only takes weapons out of the hands of good people
this is nice
nice
you mean they dont care about france s strict gun laws i m shocked shocked
yeah definitely not taking my guns from me lol
normal day in america cause we re idiots
but guns are illegal impossible
the american gun nuts dream
big deal welcome to every whacked out red state in the usa
just some americans vacationing
albanians
i thought guns were illegal in france
absolutely abhorrent they should have guillotines instead eat the rich bitches
wait till the steel starts flowing from ukraine
vive la france et les moulins rouges
is that in the no go zone
not so nice is it
so cute they wanna cos play chicago too much drill music lol adorable
i thought guns were banned there how is this possible
here s a wild thought call the police
any actual info on what they doing or just gun scary
good thing france is gun free now only the cops and bad guys have guns the poor guys in the middle has their phone though sure that will protect them
oh i thought it was florida
let s not be so quick to judge what about them makes them thugs
that s not very nice of them
boom there go all my thug stereotypes the good news is when the cops get there a shoot these guys the local citizens will be thankful and not loot a cvs and cry about what good boys they were
wonder what the chances are there illegal migrants
dude this can t be europe they don t have those kinds of problems because guns aren t everywhere like in the us
they just found out that those are illegal and are looking for an appropriate place to turn them in
what is the filter used to record this or is a particular camera
flogs
government goons extremist group of protesters
they re there to bust a mission not just to loiter
these gentlemen look like jerks
they look nice i bet they re selling cookies
they look kinda lost though

more information from nasa nasa s webb scores another ringed world with new image of uranus https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/nasa-s-webb-scores-another-ringed-world-with-new-image-of-uranus)
love uranus also if uranus has rings you should probably see a doctor
they re just making shit up at this point lol
wait are the lines and words added
i m just here for the comments
and i didn t even have to go to onlyfans
i d land on the jones ring
no mine doesn t look like that
you ve got some pretty inflamed zeta rings this cream should clear them right up
i don t understand it so it can t be true
nah bro the earth is flat
if by they re you mean month old shit accounts then yeah they are
exactly
the earth is obviously round but given how often things are made up about ufos to get funding for either black book operations or simply scamming the taxpayer it s not far fetched to imagine how many other programs are fabricated for the same reason if it happened once it will always happen
probably the most incel post lol does my account have to marinate like the human children in your fridge first why can t people make a new account
sir the government already told us they don t lie
hust because the government and our military like edging the entire nation with aliens doesn t mean that nasas very real telescope cant take pictures of a planet the government keeps vaguely talking about ufos therefore that image of uranus is fake great logic very sound
stick to the script comrade
what do you think about russia invading the ukraine comrade

is this the indian space agencies rocket launch
who s playing the kazoo
i saw a night shuttle launch in still the most incredible thing ive ever seen and remember it turning night into day
everyone could stay seated and they d get the same videos
this is a scene from cone heads
i would love to see that with my own eyes the beginning of our great adventure as a species through space truly amazing
woah the music hits different after watching kantara
who s trying to play the taps on a kazoo
ahhh so that s how they make sunlight for the flat earth
won t it hit the dome
for some samsung users it probably turned into a moon as it it was going up
holy shit that music is annoying
i like how they installed a tv just in case you missed it
numpties standing up to watch something in the sky
was not prepared for the pakistani bag pipes
very proud of our isro btw song is varah roopam i know many found it irritating but as a indian it still gives goosebumps it is from movie kantara i suggest you all should check out that movie
thaikkudam bridge represent
all those people looking through their phones really missed something special
reminds me of the fire works scene in malcolm in the middle
so cool its like the sun rising and then taking off
all im thinking about now is the song here comes the sun from the beatles
sunrise speedrun
i need to take my son while he has his child mind if i saw this as a yr old i would be enamored
ive watched that at 4am from a much farther distance it gave me the smallest hope that i can get the fuck off this planet
and then there are thousands of posts on all social media platforms of the same exact event
i d so much rather hear the impressive cacophony generated by the rocket than the annoying cacophony generated by that music someone should tell them that sometimes silence speaks the loudest
i have a photo somewhere i took at the last night space shuttle launch it was brighter than this i was around miles from the launch pad and it was seriously like the sun was rising
my silly head didn t read the title first and i though this was an epic firework
it d be more interesting if those are icbms heading to moscow
who gave this man the aux
sit down you re ruining it for everyone
if only someone would ve made a video
that one person who s out of the loop omg whats going on
that stupid person with the music is ruined it
next time i see a fireworks show i m going to bring a kazoo
never seen time fly by so fast
i m going to film the thing with my phone that i could easily youtube a better video on later rather than live in the moment
reminds me of ray bradbury s rocket summer
somebody tell kenny g to calm down a bit
diggin the music is that a specific style
turning on the audio was a mistake
why are they blasting shitty music to drown out the most incredible sound any of those people will ever hear
turn off the music and shut up the rocket can t hear you and now you can t hear the rocket either
light pollution man
why would you take the time to go see something so spectacular just to be around a load of other people making noise and playing loud music personally i d want to be as close as allowed but with as little other noise possible so i can appreciate the sound of the engines
everyone s able to see until aholes stand up
jai hind
deleted
everyone immediately takes their phones out instead of taking it all in and enjoying the moment
all nodding their heads in approval very indian
this is the most rrr rocket launch i have ever seen
woulda been nice if they would ve all kept their soup coolers fuckin shut so we could hear it take off damn why all the squealing
nah who tf set the time to
everyone of them watching through a screen with a bigger screen down front for good measure

the music makes me feel a whole new type of anger
not the first to say this but that music is fucking awful
these folks will be stoked if they ever meet a nuclear explosion
who the fuck felt like this moment needed music infuriating
the kazzoo solo really sells the seriousness
why this music tho
something about the music is telling me this isnt a rocket i should cheer for
all those chemicals
can t stop imagining the crew of this rocket doing the indian head bop
sounds like a snake charmer thought he could also make rockets dance
all that light and heat is wasted energy not contributing to lift one day we ll get even more efficient
annoying music
is that a kazoo
alien vibrating a gland that is broadly equivalent to a head shake the things that excite these creatures
timothy leary s ashes would like a word
yo bro lemme get a copy of that video
awww and i thought the countdown was for those two little cars to have a tug of war
i was lucky enough to see an ariane night launch in kourou at point kikiwi barely km away from the launch site the night turned into day and then the sound and vibration reached us it was breathtaking
approach of the second sun you have won the game
now play the video in reverse and you have a chopped and screwed meteor strike
quick take out your phone so we can watch it on a inch screen i hate people
for a second i thought this was am icbm launch and i asked myself why would people be cheering this on then i realized it s and people are just wild nowadays
what bloody git is pointing a green laser at the rocket trajectory
dam no wonder the fuel cost a billion dollars
wait a ball of fire light up the night sky no way
insane
rocks my world every launch
i don t care about the rocket what about the ball of light that looks like a ufo watching said rocket
who tf built a second sun
those are some snakey doot da doots
i enjoyed the teal hat the woman was wearing best seconds of the video of a rocket launch
halo reach music being in the background adds something special to it
that smog is ridiculously thick
you have to love all the peoples trying to take flash pictures
sound off but nice video
they created their own sun
popcorn
i live close to kennedy space center night launches are the best but after years i no longer pay much attention when rockets are going up
quite damn impressive about only thing that could top that would be to see a launch at night from the iss
atheists explain this
wait till we go to the moon again
updated for that song playing in the background perfect for a rocket launch
here comes the sun
that pos that stands up first like it s a rocket why do you need to stand up and block the people behind you

the gold foot washing pitcher and bowl are probably worth more than my house
its too bad he didn t wash the feet of a trans person inmate that would be a statement since hes denounced them gays are ok in his opinion just the rest of the catholic church don t agree hard to follow catholicism today which group is ok and which one bad but the catholic as part of colonialism residential schools sex abuse scandals well we just dont talk about that
which country i see women in what looks like hijab and the men look middle eastern
can t take them serious anymore after all the scandals that have taken place amen

bro there is nothing gayer than straight marines
so corporal klinger was just late to the party
me and the boys destroying nazis while looking gorgeous
boys will be boys
idk why they wanted to cover it up talk about bm hey hitler our troops can kick your ass while wearing dresses you know it would have ruffled his feathers
back in my old band did a small tour and one of the shows was in virginia beach the guitar player of the headlining band was part of a local biker gang so a fair portion of the audience was his crew and they were wearing their colors they were as dickish as you d imagine strutting around like they owned the place and fucking with some people but since we were cool with the band we were in with the crew at some point the doors burst open and or british navy men on shore leave came through dressed entirely in drag they were huge drunk and fabulous looking i wish i could have recorded the moment when the entire biker crew s bravado went out the window the bikers tried to inflate themselves but the british guys didn t give a fuck they were all massive military and not at all moved by the presence of a biker gang i think i held a conversation with one of the brits but i can t be sure we were exchanging face sounds but i don t think i understood a single word he said didn t stop him from being a blast to hang out with for a short while though
tried to hide these photos for years the hell are you talking about one of the most popular brit sitcoms of the 1970s it ain t half hot mum was literally about these guys in world war two
these are awesome and hilarious why hide this it shows that people try to find humor and comfort in times of chaos edit not the last pic
it was so taboo that the bbc made a hugely successful mainstream sitcom about it in the 1970s it ain t half hot mum which ran for about seven years
i m a lumberjack and i m ok
it ain t half hot mum
these are very famous photos the british government did not try to hide them these are not drag shows in the way we understand the term these are comedic pantomimes wherein men dress up as women to poke fun at themselves the tradition dates back to when women weren t allowed to act so young men and boys would dress up as women and play their roles
the government tried to hide these for years citation needed
it s very traditional in the uk for men to be in drag in pantomimes https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pantomime_dame
check out the last season episode of black adder with rowen atkinson hugh laurie and stephen fry https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major\_star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major_star)
a bbc comedy series made this a well known thing in the uk in the 1970s it ain t half hot mum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/it_ain't_half_hot_mum?wprov=sfti1)
people who are upset about drag have no idea what drag actually is
the government didn t hide shit there s even a beloved sitcom about the entertainment units called it ain t half hot mam
quote by eddie izzard because we all know one of the main factors of war is the element of surprise and what could be more surprising than the first batallion transvestite brigade airborne wing
the movie stalag has a scene like this an amazing movie and the acting is exemplary william holden won the oscar for best actor great stuff if the super heroes have bored you
my grandfather was a pow in germany in wwi he had many photos of the drag shows they put on in the camp
my question is did they pack the dresses with them where d they come from
they were having a good time together in their downtime dressing in drag did not make them gay i do like to think for the men who were gay trans unsure these moments gave them just a few minutes of happiness
it ain t half hot mum a bbc comedy featuring just this sort of concert party set in ww2 burma they also co incidentally were in the royal artillery it s very dated in its language and attitudes but the late windsor davies playing the disdainful permanently disgusted and bullying battery sergeant major williams remains a classic performance
reminds me of the simpsons when grandpa simpson became a cabaret singer in nazi german to ride out the war
in a truly free society people should have the right to dress in whatever manner they desire people should be able to love whoever they choose women should be able to determine whether or not they are capable mentally or physically to have children the government should not have the inclination nor the authority to prohibit these inalienable rights
can confirm this is a photo of my grandad pretty one in the white dress holding the flower with one hand at one such event my uncle went to the same place recently stood in the same place in a dress too https://imgur.com/a/c3ibphq
costumes are fun playing around with fashion and makeup is fun people seriously need to get over themselves
anyone who s ever met a high school or college age guy knows that of them regardless of their orientation think dressing up and acting like a stereotypical woman is the funniest thing in the world see any halloween party or pep rally
bing crosby and danny kaye in white christmas sisters so good and very likely a throwback to this very thing given their characters were ww2 vets
dressing in drag and fighting fascists that sounds familiar
i got a photo of my great grandpa and his shipmates dressed up with makeup on
there s a great section of vonneguts slaughterhouse that describes this in a pow camp
the british troops operating artillery while in drag is metal as fuck
take that all boomers who are mad at men being feminine now a days
still prevalent i can t tell you the amount of maid outfits these army dudes have lmao
and this is why we were able to obliterate the opposition
i did drag at a highschool talent show it pissed off the teachers it was great
men have been dressing up as women in theatre since shakespeare because it s funny
this proud history is why drag queens should be riding about this to kids in 1st grade i really don t see the problem i don t get why conservatives hate the left this isn t progress this is history
the british have no problem with drag that s a us thing the brits go to see panto stage shows most christmases think a children s story musical play but super camp with lots of adult jokes in it with all pantos having a dame the dame must be played by a tall well built man playing a lady nobody mistakes a dame for being a woman but nobody would call a dame anything other than she her drag is a proud part of our culture
i m kind of embarrassed to be associated with a society that makes such a big deal out of men being silly in women s clothes or vice versa or whatever
drag is an integral part of the tradition of western theatre like it s just always been a part of it it s normal it s such a weird thing to have a problem with too many men who were once little boys playing dress up in their mums closets only to get belted by their own fathers who probably got belted by theirs for the same reason we re looking at the ramifications of intergenerational trauma that the patriarchy has inflicted on men and boys it just breaks my heart that a little boy could be treated so violently for the simple act of being curious and imaginative i really hope artists of all kinds but especially theatrical artists and actors pay attention to the history of drag and do everything they can to protect and maintain the integrity of drag as an art form and as living demonstration of human rights
thats one way to raise moral
everyone getting heated about the cross dressing yet the minstrel blackface going unnoticed
these are not drag queens tho these are just straight dudes in the military having fun to lift up the morale and stay motivated nothing is gayer than a bunch of military straight men i just wanna throw that out there because i m in the infantry and sometimes the barracks look like this during the weekend
so running jumping climbing trees putting on makeup when you re up there
harmful for our kids fucken headass
brits wouldn t hide this they would get a chuckle out of it this goes right along with their sense of fun they are still like this drag is fun to brits they aren t desantis acolytes they love it when i was in the falkland islands the main town put on a drag show with all the prominent men singing and dancing show numbers it was fun with great jokes and humor it was impossible to get get a ticket because the shows were always sold out
what people don t realize is attire and satire kinda rhyme nothing wrong with this behavior just bunch of dudes having fun drag isn t just a lgbtq thing unless you are rupaul
lemme guess we re gonna find an old navy photo of desantis in drag place yer bets
i always like to point out greece and thailand to bigots my argument so it s only in these cultures where there were lots and lots of gay and transfolk just here no where else why here is it because there was no stigma yes so it s not there are suddenly more gays transfolk because of the woke mindvirus and more we re placing less stigma on these behaviors and those who suppressed these desires are no longer doing so thanks for coming to my ted talk
nothing is more patriotic than kicking nazi ass while in drag just ask joseph joestar http://images.shoutwiki.com/jojoss/4/4a/unit_joseph_joestar_%28tequila_joseph%29.png
its cool how every single one of these dudes is one million times more manly than any twitter blue checkmark alpha male virtue signaling conservative loser
as a straight male drag shows are fun the performers put so much into their costumes and their routines are often courageous if you have a problem with drag shows you either don t like having fun or you aren t comfortable with your own sexuality
they probably did it to make fun of and laugh at each other not to express an alternate identity
they packed all this stuff and took it with them to the front lines
that would make an awesome war movie
male drag shows are an old english tradition that goes back to shakespeare and probably before that you might want to look up that name shakespeare
they look dashing it s cool seeing how happy they look having drag shows during such a difficult time
ronald reagan is in the second to last picture
reminds me of the eddie izzard skit about the first batallion transvestite brigade https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlnfdbapiyq). parachuting in with fantastic makeup enemy is like fuckin hell look at these guys they re covered in make up oh shit they ve got guns they ve got guns
was this the reagan drag or a different one
if the alpha males over at the daily wire see this their heads will explode does anyone know their email btw
if there is one thing the british like more than drag it s wait there is nothing they like more than drag this is only joking a small amount for anyone unfamiliar the uk has a long tradition of drag and it has been a popular form of entertainment an absurd amount of british comedy inevitably involves putting on dresses
republican are against fun and light hearted tomfoolery offends their sensibilities
they didn t try to hide any of this information the biggest hit musical of featured ww2 soldiers performing drag for one another
ever watch a british comedy i remember in keeping up appearances richard was dressed in women s clothes once he appeared and i swear the laugh track went for a solid minute with no dialogue probably exaggerated heavily but i certainly recall it being an excessively long duration
and the best part is ronald reagan starred in one
raise your hand if you remember m a s h this is nothing new
topsy turvy used to be a big thing in england in the 70s butlins and pontins always had a show like that not my proudest moment but i do look good in a dress
drag is only ok if it s hetero men doing it ok no gays allowed they are fighting for our country bless them bible thumpers
it takes a real man to wear a dress not give a crap and go kick some ass good for these guys i think it s awesome giving me mash vibes
grandpa tell me about the war i saw things and did things that i can t talk about but my hands will never be clean again
drag queen war time
these pictures should really be shared with as many people as possible
to quote peacemaker back when men were men because they weren t afraid to be women
a brilliant comedy called it ain t half hot mum is based on exactly this following the royal artillery concert party at the back end of ww2 it s a classic windsor davies was absolutely brilliant all episoded are on youtube be warned it is not politically correct by today s standards
my great uncles who served in ww2 used to have drag shows at our family reunions maybe the military is where they got it from thye were so macho and serious in real life it was a whole other side of them
the government absolutely did not try to hide these photos for years the government encouraged these shows and often times hired writers to create new songs and shows for the men to perform idk why the person who created this image felt the need to lie about the government in this case
everyone who lives in the uk knows the british love drag you see it in pantos you see it in sports teams you see it in amdram you see it in stag dos it is everywhere and no one could give a flying fuck
dude i m sorry but seeing a bunch of men dressed as women fucking up the germans is a1 quality gold drag queens were the original anti fascists
i would ve fucking died from laughing too much if i had to watch my bros load up ammo and fire upon the enemy in their doll dresses
drag is entertainment period
the amount of men ive met who appear traditionally masculine irl but secretly want to be put in a pink dress and have a buttplug shoved up their ass is far too high
i highly doubt the government has been hiding this for years its common knowledge
classic reddit trying to rewrite history this was done as a joke not to express your sexuality
i m guessing this may of been posted due to events currently in the news its worth pointing out to avoid false equivalences that the above occurred in a different context and for different reasons
my grandfather still has a program and pictures of him in one of these shows in france
conservatives are ruining everything these days by insisting it s all sexual and pedophilic fuckers
top brass is dumb if i was the enemy out there struggling fighting and dying and i saw that my enemy was fucking fab while doing it my morale would go right in the shitter
these may be the best pictures i ve ever seen trying to have a laugh amongst all that insanity
also they produced movies in drag in one ronald fucking reagan plays the lead you cannot make this shit up
middle guy in the 6th picture is lovingg it
insert gif of ken jeong saying gay
grab your dress we have nazis to shoot is the mood of the year
who doesn t love the movie some like it hot all good fun
link to source saying the government hid the pics please
ah yes the battle of the bulge

lifelong resident of phoenix i can t remember a winter where it rained more than this winter we needed it hope we get more winters like it
all that water from the melting polar ice caps has to fall somewhere
as calif allows millions of gallons of water to dump into the ocean will cry drought in a couple of years
and it s 70at 9pm in mesa
you live in a desert most deserts are known for their lack of rain want rain move to a swamp
oooh climate change deniers are on your ass with the downvotes keep em coming industrialists
lol conservatives plan for getting more fresh water into the colorado river is to make it snow more then melt it during the summers
deserts still need rain too much can be a problem but lots of the southwest has been in a drought the excess rain can help refill reservoirs and rivers like the colorado lake mead was at an all time low in early and is a large contributor to az water
so informative thanks for adding this
its called the refill lake mead plan

blue jays sure are pretty but they are mean little guys
steller s jay
you may be familiar with the concept of bird species where the males have bright plumage and the females have more camouflaged feather colors this rule does not apply to jays both sexes have bright plumage because there s no point in hiding when they ll be the ones striking first anyway
yay yuh
wooooaaaaahhhhhhhh
the steller jay is named for german explorer georg steller
stellar s jays are annoying af those little fuckers have olympian lungs
mordecai and evil mordecai
they re like home and away birds yup they re mean i rescued a cardinal once that was being hunted by a blue jay it collapsed from exhaustion near me in a parking lot after being chased by a jay i shooed off the jay before it could deliver a coup de grace poor cardinal just lay there huffing hard trying hard to catch its breath looking up at me like what fresh hell is this i scooped it up and put it in a box until it had recovered itself and then i let it go told it to have a better day and to watch out for blue jays edit sp
east and west coast when i lived in washington state for a while i was shocked by the black and blue birds growing up in the east coast
huh never seen such a high quality picture of mordecai
are stellar jays as big of assholes as blue jays
i can hear this picture
we have grey jays in my area very nice birds they will come up to ya
i ll bet both are assholes
scrub jay has entered the chat scrub jay https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/aphelocoma)
steller s https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/steller's_jay
i just see two assholes
as beautiful as they are fuckin blue jay s are the most annoying loud mouthed beeked birds where i live in canada
you can train both these species like pavlov s dog with peanuts
western scrub jays are the third leg to the triumvirate we have them here in calif at lower elevations they are like a small hawk and will prey on fledglings had a neighbor with chickens when i was a kid blue jays would swoop down into the yard and carry off chicks beautiful birds but with an attitude
o mordecai
perfect shade of blue denim for jay leno
both are secretly jay
what about an ll cool jay
stellar s jays are the mortal enemy of crows around here
i might be the only person who doesn t think blue jays are assholes
i saw one gathering nesting material near geese the blue jay squared up with them and they waddled away from him i m pretty sure he was gathering their feathers too the honey badger of the sky they give no fucks
blue jay and his cousin emo jason
i always though that the south american gralha azul would be a far cousin of the blue jays https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/azure_jay
i love steller s jays my family has some property in the mountains that is home to a few of them and they love to come and check us out and we love to throw peanuts for them seeing how close to us we can get them to come for the peanuts it s fun to watch them take the peanut and then fly up to a branch and crack open the shell x200b it s extra cool cause the ones in that region have unique face markings that are normal for them only in that small area it s a couple of little white lines over their eyes that make them look even more angry than they already are
i can already picture him next to a raccoon going wooooaaahh
i m moving from new york to utah so i m excited to see the steller s jays in person after seeing blue jays growing up
steller s jays are actually more closely related to the crow than the blue jay it s evident in their behavior too smart and slightly obnoxious i love them
mordecai and his half black cousin
i see blue jays all the time i really like the stellar s murdered out look
i vote to change the name of the stellar jay to nightwing
stellars are all over big bear in california
saw both this week
the steller visits my balcony all the time to feed on rice that i put in
no stellar jays here so i am digging that look
i had a beanie baby blue jay took him everywhere til he flew away
i can feel the urge on the left one to tell me about wacky war tactics
ones the happy farm boy while the other is the goth kid
are those also dicks
wooooooooooooooooahhhhhhhh
you know who else is a bird cousin
l mustang gt r mustang dark horse both are beautiful
just goes to what a little therapy can do he ll be a magnificant jay soon enough
damn i didn t know blue jays had dark mode
they both look dope
a stellar jay is just the product of a crow and blue jay getting down
roll jays baby gonna get the final four next year
used to hand feed baby stellars when i volunteered at the wildlife hospital tiny babies with big loud dramatic personalities i loved them so much they d scream and gape when i approached and then made amazing om nom nom squawks while i fed them jays can be clever little jerks but they re such awesome birds
scrub jays are where it s at
this is me when i went from middle school to highschool
hehe oh whoaaaaa oh woahhh
this checks out they have the same last name
damn the answer was in nature this whole time
damn those jays are foine
these will interbreed i ve got several pics of hybrids
where scrub jay is
home and away jays
pretty birds
destructive jerks they pillage other song bird nest
the stellar jays flock at my house chase everything else off and make a ton of noise but they look so cool so it doesn t bother me too much the alternative would likely be crows anyways
when i was a child we found a baby blue jay that had fallen we took it to the vet and they said to feed it the wet cat food sort of blended up in a syringe iirc anyway it couldn t fly it just hopped around the house so we named him hopper and we kept him until he could fly and released him when he grew up a bit i would catch him little crickets and bugs to eat after we released him he would land on my dad s shoulder when he was outside cutting the grass or whatever as a grown up blue jay it was super cool that bird was always nice never pecked me or anything
based on their shared look of hostility i m sure these lads share the murder gene
they re closely related to crows and ravens
that s because they re from toronto
yardhawks we call them they even terrorize the squirrels we feed dive bomb the dogs come to a window and demand to be fed if the peanut dispenser s empty little jerks for sure
that was my first thought too seeing this but then was like is that even true turns out kinda they are very territorial and also will raid nests but all in all i think most birds would do the same if they could i ve seen some mob sparrow attacks before that haunted me
blue jays and cardinals often fight one another for territory rights when my neighbors put out birdseed they re so pretty but damn are they aggressive
thank you shit was making my eye twitch
even the babies are bright blue just without the slicked back spikey head feathers
awoahhhhhhhhhhhh
dude this isn t even my final form woooooooaaaaah now step off
yeah same with the blue jays it doesn t seem right that a scream like that should come out of such a pretty bird
total bastards they ll mug you in an alley take your wallet then shiv you anyway
some years ago my dad started feeding them in the back yard so they d come around a lot more often when i was visiting the screaming would start at around 6am right outside my window
i was amazed at how much bigger blue jays are to cardinals
same for me i think i prefer the stellar s jays absolute assholes the lot of them
blue jay https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/blue-jay) steller s jay https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/stellers-jay)
stellar jay why they would be assholes
worse
bigger and worse i love them
i don t know about assholes but they are dumb and loud they peck at my deck railings like they re looking for bugs to eat
yes mean nasty loud and generally pissed off all the time we call them pterodactyls around here in northern california
those are known as camp robbers in the mountain west states one got my uncle s shiny watch on a backpacking trip
what did mordecai ever do to you
jays are in the corvid family so they are smarter than birds have any right to be
lol same i don t have stellar s down in nc but i ve never seen a blue jay mess with any other birds besides hawks at my house and i m always grateful for the sounds they make doing so as it announces to me a bird watcher that a hawk or owl is near never seen them interact with crows either crows are also great hawk alarms
for the stellar jays in my neighborhood the slightly is inappropriate
that s awesome we used to train wild ones to come eat peanuts to the sound of a bell
bluejays are corvids same family as crows super smart
awesome story the bird rehab advice has changed now they recommend thawing frozen blueberries and feeding that makes sense it s easier to do and packs a ton of nutrients
well given that they are corvids nah kidding jays are found in bands not murders i am not trying to start a unidan thing here
magpies also
well birds are tiny dinosaurs google search even showed blue jays are mean as a common search result

she didn t lose the will to live after did she
is she safe is she alright
ngl this is the first time i saw a fish deliver a baby wholesome
til guppies bear live offspring
just wondering did the fry end up moving to the dark side of the tank
anakin is rhe father isnt he
was that luke or leia
we have a gallon tall tank with cory catfish some neon tetras and a betta woke up the other morning to new cory s turns out one of them was laying eggs behind the filter and we missed them
congrats padme and congrats to the new grandparent
the audio on this vid makes it 000x cuter congrats
for a senator she swims pretty good
oh hi baby welcome to the world and congratulations mama padme
cute i used to have swordtails mollies that had live babies
my dog is named padme
just a suggestion put some tank gravel in for the babies to hide when i bred guppies the adults had a tendency to eat the young the gravel gives them hidey holes where adult guppies couldn t get them
ooba ooba
never knew a fish didnt lay eggs
it s a guppy puppy
me too i was surprised it came out a baby fish and not an egg
guppy having babies video length baby haiyaaaa
u savevideo
watch out for those bubbles guppy
watch out for those bubbles guppy
congrats
is she going to die of nothing afterwards
guppy puppies
freshest sushi in the history of sushi
obi one darth eighter ten kenobi
had no idea there fish who gave live births cool
will she die from sadness
naming it luke or leiah obviously hide them from their father
luke leia and the rest
time for her to die of sadness
i hope she got a job
fries
that fish did not waste a moment swim
and thus young luke was born
idk why but that fish looks like starscourge radahn
is one of them going to grow up on a desert planet in a binary star system
mine did too but the father ate them all
aww somehow her baby looks just like her
what the hell i thought fish laid eggs
did u name that fish luke
luke lea luke lea
thought they were saying rabies
yah cant keep her in there with the babies as mom will eat them strange but true
i m always curious if she lived what anakin would have done i mean i know it s a fictional story but i have to believe she would be like wtf and he would eventually kill her
it seems in you re anger you ve killed her
yes she s in an isolation tank she and the little ones are safe
i thought fish had eggs not live births
just wait until you see mom eat the babies yes this is what guppies do
i always thought live birth gave it mammal classification i guess not
they re in a separation tank now i m keeping them there until they re big enough to not be appetizers for my gourami
as a matter of fact he is lol i have a theme going here
my year old loved the experience
it s hard to see in this video but she s in a tank with a slotted bottom that the fry can get through but she can t when she was done i removed her so the fry have the smaller tank to themselves but she did get to one of them sadly

tldr self fulfilling prophecy i always read it like this anakin found out heard was fortold what have you that padme would die and that is what initially set him to looking into the story of plaguis and the abilities of bringing back the dead from there palpatine was palpatine and brought anakin fully to the dark side then padme gave up on the will to live and the story goes on as we know it
originally she was supposed to live and go into hiding with leia before dying later on but georgie porgie retconned it i can t remember exactly when this got changed but apparently there are small references in the first trilogy and maybe eu
there are two schools of thought amongst the nerds one the one hand if she had lived anakin would ve realized that palpatine was manipulating him and would ve killed him one the other hand palpatine is insanely powerful so if she had lived palpatine would have twisted anakin s mind further making him kill her and possibly the children therefore no luke
no no she was alive i felt her
the fish ending
some lay eggs some have live babies some even incubate the eggs in their mouth
it s sort of an egg as the little one seemed to have a yolk sac under its spine which could provide nourishment until it s ready to do fishy things and find its own food am not an ichthyologist so don t know if that s true or not
sharks also give live births
this is awesome i ve got a breeding pair of pearl gourami but they lay eggs i have a video somewhere of it
my guppies had babies a lot and i didn t have an isolation tank the horrors following where the babies became a buffet was hard to watch
i m so sorry
wow she had the baby then ate it right after
i m not a big star wars guy at all but i ve generally been on the side of the theory that his vision of padme dying was an implant by palpatine the jedi council was well aware of the fact that anakin was much more emotional than they d prefer and palpatine was wise enough to make him perceive danger to act fast him being with padme was a huge point of contention for his strife with the council
interesting
palpatine woulda took luke in and killed vader bruh he was all burnt up
i miss her
honestly guppies shouldn t have that much of a yolksack when they are born they look to be delivered early which can happen due to stress of recently being moved either into a new tank or from being in a breeder box like this
not all sharks give live birth some lay eggs

outfitted with an m20 recoilless rifle the tap proved more than capable of destroying makeshift fortifications used by guerrillas in algeria and indochina the m20 was designed as an anti tank recoilless rifle that was outfitted with a high explosive anti tank warhead under ideal circumstances the rifle could penetrate 100mm of armor from yards away the m20 outfitted on the vespa was never actually meant to be fired while the vehicle was in motion instead the vespa frame functioned as a way of transporting the artillery to the front line once there the rifle would be removed from the vespa and placed on a tripod for accurate firing
it looks like an s g i joe toy
not as effective as they hoped
oh sure when vespa does it from the factory they re fighting fascism but when i do it in my garage i m a danger to society the double standards are unfathomable
and though equipped with cannon charges the poor mighty vespa could not handle the recoil of one and thus was called the vespakazi
beep beep mother fuckers
i can see one of the big bollywood guys sliding in on this thing and taking out like cop cars tanks and jets in shot lol
important to note this is just how the weapon was transported it was typically unloaded and then assembled before being fired
i m not going to say what it looks like
so your nuts were resting on an in horizontal mortar sounds kinky
a gungoose
ciao
this looks like something a wes anderson character would use
paging u ludwigahgren we found your new ride and your new video idea
neat post but i m not sure that is actually a vespa i mean don t they normally have twenty headlights mirrors on them https://i.pinimg.com/736x/bb/28/76/bb2876ce1c321375408852660422e618.jpg)
italian and french designers great in fashion war not so much
source for news article photo more info about the history of the variant https://www.businessinsider.com/this-vespa-was-designed-to-take-on-tanks-2014-11)
i had one like this for use in urban traffic it was great fun my lawyer says i m only looking at so i have that going for me
i wanna see a video of someone shooting while driving the vespa
then it did a triple back flip it did not however stick the landing footage at
what is r fuckcars stance on this
the other italian army guys must have made so much fun of these guys
r warthunder gaijoob italian wheeled r3 when
it goes faster backwards than forward
recoilless rifle on a vespa i m on that
maybe the cutest to most dangerous machine of all time
in trained hands the vespa could be used to deliver the paratroops as well just aim the cannon downwards and hold the fuck on
that would make the morning commute more interesting
r cataclysmdda leaking
that s one way to do a wheelie
peak of italian ingeniring
how do i import it in india
that is the most dragon ball looking vehicle i have ever seen in my life
r mildlypenis

this reminds me of my buddy larry everyone made fun of him because he was only tall then they found out he was packing a howitzer in his pants
ka ciao
where can i get one for riding the streets of houston
the gi s they love these scooters
i just imagine this firing and the poor vespa goes flying would be hilarious
this some r itemshop shit
vespa tap don tcha just love the military industrial complex
thank you for playing twisted metal
good for clearing a space through traffic without having to split
that makes sense you took away my wtf factor thank you
so it won t work on the
i wish they brought it back i find it very useful i don t get it who wouldn t want cannons on their vespas
i m genuinely upset they didn t call it the vespew or the vespapapapapa if it was an automatic gun
thanks for the details i was triggered by the reference to a cannon in the title
anyone else hear kind of a high pitched buzz
not as effective as they m oped
until you find out about the massacre of
it appears to be a recoilless rifle
vespakazi got me
it did set a reverse speed record for motorbikes under 150cc displacement
but the shell has to bounce between the targets like captain america threw it but still exploding on each ricochet
is that what inches looks like
those wernt mortars they where cannons points if you know the reference
should use
great for the commute and having to deal with w s in their ford ranger wildtracks driving like s
am i an asshole for using a scooter i really need it to transport my recoilless rifle to the combat zone
recoilless cannon it seems
can adjust cannon direction for speed boost
while yes during traffic the vespa could keep up with the speed would you want to be on something that tiny on the
you know it with extra explosions in every frame kirk cameron ain t got shit on bollywood splosions pew pew boom boom boom
i understood what you meant by the emojis but why lol
it s a recoilless weapon you might need to ride the actual explosion to gain speed
fair point
its got a cannon i think traffic may be a non issue
trying to be polite have also spent a lot of time on the twitters every character counts
i don t just rocket jump i rocket jump on a scooter

every time a clip of the k max is posted people have the same reaction and more informed people respond the same way so let s just cover a few key points what if the rotor collide the can t they re geared together for them to come out of sync would require a catastrophic failure of the transmission such a failure would cause any helicopter to certainly crash why do they speed up and slow down the rotors are in fact spinning at a constant rate it s an optical illusion focus on each hub and you ll see it s a constant rate why the twin rotors allow for a very high external lifting capacity 6000lbs and is very stable additionally since they rotate in opposite directions the helicopter does not require a tail rotor the stability and responsiveness of pilot commands make it an excellent helicopter for lifting and placing machinery or construction components it looks unsafe it s not it s actually exceedingly safe even for the high standards of aviation the engineering doesn t care about how you perceive it it s very safe regardless it s ugly hey look buddy i m an engineer that means i solve problems not problems like what is beauty cause that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy i solve practical problems
bad ass little work horse ugly but very stable safe despite how it looks they even made a couple unmanned versions for the marines that they still use but if i was going to pick a crazy design for a helicopter i d go with the classic chinook
why tho
that funny looking thing is probably one of the safest cargo carrier helicopters out there at 6000lbs
if the gears are placed right it would be impossible for the blades to ever collide you d break the blade before it hit anything

armchair engineers comments never fail to amuse
anxiety as a mode of transportation
helicopter pilot here the advantage of counter rotating blades is that in conventional helicopter designs the tail rotor robs about of engine power but produces no useful lift on the other hand dual rotor helicopters use of engine power after parasite drag from engine accessories induced drag etc to make lift directional control in the k max isn t great and it has a tendency at a hover to weathervane into the wind but that s not super important in utility or firefighting in firefighting it gets type heavy ship contract money even though it uses the same engine as the uh which is a cheaper type aircraft hence k max is extremely profitable on fire contracts due to lower operating costs k max also doesn t have hydraulics it uses pushrod actuated trim tabs on the wooden rotors to make changes to lift the rotors are part of the same transmission assembly they don t ever hit each other
i had a g i joe toy helo that had dual rotors i think it was called the mamba
i don t trust that thing
it truly amazes me how precise engineering can be in the right hands much like the planes of ww2 that fired their machine guns between the propellers all based off the cam timing from the engine
we mechanical engineers have way too much faith on gears i just realised
all the people here saying what a bad idea absolutely stunning not the slightest idea of mechanics and yet so vocal dunning kruger was right
it looks like that one fish in nemo
helicopter type the coolest thing to see working a wildfire other than a supertanker
we have these in switzerland to install lift towers for skiing amongst other things badazz all around
worked security at flir they had a chart of the helicopters they could mount their insanely advanced thermal etc imaging turrets on and k max was right there they re excellent for search rescue when you need to lift an entire goddamn truck out of a ravine
sir your anxiety nightmare is waiting on the tarmac to take you to wendy s
greetings general kenobi
what an ugly helicopter i need me some apache or airwolf
the k max is my favorite flying crane
i don t care how amazingly perfect that mechanical timing is i d still be paranoid it would fail
serious question what is the advantage of this uber complex dual rotor system over a single rotor helicopter
gotta love a synchronized double helicopter
that is one ugly aircraft
an honest question how does it turn do the rotors tilt or
it only looks like a terrible idea
who would have thought the most triggering thing of the day was blades rotating while intertwined with each other this bothers me on so many levels i can t put it into words
this is the ac that the company i used to work for integrated into an unmanned cargo delivery system for the usmc i m pretty sure that the program did not last
so with each rotor only having two blades is it that much harder to maintain balance without four how much worse is the maintenance on this thing
great video thanks what great engineering on another note rip eardrums of those who hit play without knowing volume was at
looks like a black kitten inside the helicopter
that helicopter was born in chernobyl
seems like a perfect murphy s law experiment
i know they re mechanically linked and impossible to collide but the anxiety it gives me is still real
holy shit my anxiety level throughout the clip
anxiety
quick someone play duel of the fates
taking the most uncontrollable vehicle and making about times scarier that s human engineering
victory of engineers over common sense
i wish i was a bird
i scrolled and scrolled looking for an ornithopter comment i can t be the only one who sees it lols
gallagher opportunity
sword fight
pragmatic ornithopters
samurai helicopter
why does this helicopter look like it s mother has grabbed it by the scruff of its neck and it stayed like that
i would be terrified of getting near that thing while it s still rotating that angle it s freaky
y tho
i ve seen regular helicopters do back flips don t think we need this eventual catastrophe
wcgw
nope
ugliest helicopter i ve ever seen
deleted
hard pass there s enough things that can go wrong with one rotor putting two in an overlapping symmetry with a safe zone between the two blades is a little too risky for me
deleted
margin of error is too small must be either perfectly synced or they re dead
r whatcouldgowrong
seems like a bad idea
deleted
seems like a bad idea
oh man it would be not good if one would stop working
you know what i ll just take the bus
looks like a disaster waiting to happen
anybody else see what looks like cat eyes in the pilot area on top looks like a giant black cat looking at you
that off center red light on the bar between the propellers is driving me very very crazy
the landing gear is made with shopping cart wheels
that is an ugly mutant locust
i know it works i see it works but i don t believe it works
k mart
helicopter looks ugly tho
i m not super up on mechanics and phsyics but this has a threshold right mass speed ect
yeah no yeah no
no thanks
nope
bet you check that timing chain every day before you turn that ignition on
i don t trust like that
i am happy for this technological achievement but for non engineering mind like mine this is asking for trouble
can have a midair collision with itself
who the hell looked at a helicopter and said hmm i don t think this is dangerous enough
more points of failure
that is one weird looking cartel helicopter
if just a teeny bit off timing wham
all you need is one rotor to spin a tad faster and boom
but why why would you do that
out of all the helicopter designs i trust this one the least
r nope
engineers test testing their prototypes must fearing theirs dear life
no thanks i ll stay on the ground
terrible design and looks shit
what is one sputters they just collide seems like a bad design
as someone who s timing belt on their car snapped as they were about to merge in front of a semi i ain t getting in one of them fuckers don t need the timing on those blades getting outta whack and plummeting me to my death
nope nope nope
if that ever broke it would turn you into chop suey
helicopters with tail rotors can encounter various mechanical issues and still fly land with a degradation of flight controls helicopters with intermeshing rotors with mech issues skip all that degradation stuff and go right into catastrophic failure
could you imagine being the test pilot for its first flight you d have to really trust the peoples who built and designed it
hey guys you won t believe this i was drunk as hell the other night and made up this stupid idea off the top of my head drunk dialed my engineering buddy over at this company and the idiot actually made it i told him i was joking and everything he wouldn t listen
that s a whole lotta nope for me better hope there s no turbulence

two of my good friends are on there having been murdered in the kalamazoo uber shooting i miss you barb and mary jo we all do
some years back s guy shot up an amish school killing six girls and wounding five more the killer committed suicide the amish community visited the killer s parents to offer condolences and forgiveness this mass shooing is almost never referenced
rip dan parmenter i zoomed in and he was the first pic i saw so terrible he was my brothers friend thank you for recognizing the niu school shooting
the fact that this is only some of the victims is very disturbing
somebody should build a wall like the vietnam memorial in dc but with pictures instead of names would be very powerful
a guy from my community died in the vegas shooting he s in this photo
the amount of african americans murdered in mass shootings every year is highly underrepresented in these photos
i remember some of these faces and many blur together columbine was when i started paying attention i was in 7th grade at the time im almost now how many is it since then i lost count long ago but in all that time one thing stands out every time republicans have said it s inappropriate to talk of solutions at a time like this the sooner we rid ourselves of that cancerous party the safer we all will be
posting this here for the people asking why didn t you do people killed by __ i didn t make this because i think that mass shootings kill the most amount of americans but because i don t often see the people behind the numbers on the news etc yet there is still organizations that track their names i do want to make collages similar to this with the purpose of humanizing people who simply end up a number in a statistic but without reliable archives it will take some time
now do chicago for the last years you ll need more space tho
get ready america that sad list is only going to get bigger with the interest of time
so much lost potential one of those children could have grown up to cure cancer or invent something fantastic
some that s even more fucked up
it s sad when as soon as i opened the image i immediately saw someone i knew
let s compare that to the number of regular ol shootings hint there are more of them
years for this quantity try days https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting)
the oxford high shooting was minutes away from me and a girl in friends with was in a classroom that had bulletin in the door another friend was on the football team with tate and in his homecoming entourage it s devastating yet old news now i can t even think about it without being upset i guess that s better than the sociopaths who said there should ve been more guns in the school every teacher should have a gun etc i know a lot of teacher who would much rather not have a fucking gun in the classroom the mental gymnastics are insane
i collected photos from the those whose names were listed in the violence project https://www.theviolenceproject.org) as i see it used most often in statistics i also gathered a few photos from this year which brought the number of photos to however the violence project has limitations such as only including shootings with fatalities and even with those limitations i was unable to find photos of a couple dozen victims regardless i think the difference in seeing these people as people instead as lines on a graph was heartbreaking edit i also wanted to add that this is not the only type of collage i hope to create to humanize victims of all circumstances i simply began with mass shooting victims because there are organizations that track their names
i will now tell you a total number of mass shootings in my country where guns are heavily regulated it may shock you ready zero
pictured in were shit in mass shootings died that s just mass shootings in a single year o
the pulse shooting in orlando is still one that haunts me my mother is lesbian and had just moved down for central florida when this happened her and her girlfriend decided against going to pulse that night and went elsewhere i can t imagine if things had turned out differently god bless all those sweet souls
now do drug overdoses
wow just some goodness omg i pray for their families to heal
only some not nearly all
looks more like last month in gun free chicago
sad that we still have victim disarmament zones
rest in peace daniel kaufman you were always a saint

such an unnecessary and tragic waste of human life
this is heartbreaking unnecessary lives abruptly ended by evil their families now see empty spaces on thanksgiving christmas dinners from where these angels once filled those spaces some lost a brother a sister a mother a father an aunt an uncle a friend a neighbor a regular at a diner if only those shooters had a conscious that made them aware of this information before they decide to take innocent lives
may thy rest in peace
what about the pictures of the victims of drunk distracted drivers
this is awful it sucks that all these people died
this is heartbreaking the amount of photos there none of them deserved it rest in peace to those souls
people are killed all the time from presentable means make sure you hug your loved ones today
drunk driving kills people everyday in the us nobody is blaming alcohol they blame the driver
where are the gang related ones
now do any other country
my first boyfriend s cousin is up here we were now we re and this is so normal i never would ve thought people would value firearms over the lives of american children
to all the folks in the comments saying its not a gun problem really do you really believe this the united states is the only developed country in the entire world that has this problem canada and australia which by the way also boasts a high rate of gun ownership though no nearly as high as the states has nowhere close to the amount of gun related homicides as the states do you know why strict gun laws these do not mean that the government is taking away all firearms it just means background checks and regulations and they work there has been studies even within the united states itself that examines the differences in gun laws between states the study very conclusively shows that stricter gun control laws lead to far safer states guns are the problem and the us is the only developed country on earth who hasn t figured out how to deal with them yet sources https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5801608/. https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d1005. https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-gun-policy-global-comparisons. also sorry for ranting lol am currently in an irritable mood
this is such clickbait barely any black people on here when they are far and above the highest number of victims of mass shootings
how about a picture of victims of drunk drivers
tragic just like all the kids killed by alcoholic abusive parents the ones who commit suicide after being gaslit about their sexual abuse the ones who od bc they never got enough love as a child the people who die every year in car crashes at the hands of alcoholics and cycle and cycle america has the most openly corrupt and tyrannical government in its history and people are looking to take away the very thing that stops them from being dragged away in the middle of the night by those very same govn agents bc they wanted to stop giving up their freedoms did you see the vids of chinese and iran citizens being killed and jailed and brutalized bc they didn t like being told to act as a thing rather than a human being did u notice how they couldn t defend themselves how the govn agents were the ones and only ones with the rifles we protect all our valuable places of business with armed security why not schools are our children not worth that investment
it won t be me until it is
this is a small sacrifice for the greater good empowering a lot of weak men and their desire to shoot things and feel powerful
i feel so sorry for the people who have to live in the us not knowing if your child will come home from school alive
the fact that there are children in there is heartbreaking i highly dislike this country
can we do one with all the people that gave up guns because the government said it was for the best then killed them it s alot more then this
saddest post of the day
and congress won t do anything
wow like to see victims of dwi people a year dead from physicians mistakes every year super sad that these get no attention
what a ridiculous country believing more in their rights and constitution over the health and safety of their citizens
now make one with photos from the last days of mass shootings in the us
someone please make a massive pic containing all of them they all deserve to be seen and the sheer number would be an overwhelming symbol
sad as fuck
so sad to see all those young faces
what is this a photograph for ants
rest in power
legitimately horrifying fucked up place
it s worth adding that gunshot wounds are now the leading cause of death for children in the usa
we re so pro life we ll let your kids die and then assault you verbally and physically if you try do anything about it republicans
americaneedsgunreform checkthestatistics
all this thanks to the world s most entitled hobbyists
not necessary the avg in the us is death every mins i can t imagine the number of people who are crippled for life
not interesting just sad
would probably need literally thousands of these collages to show all the victims shit is wild why the fucking fuck would i ever bring a mini me into this bullshit i don t even like myself shouts to the parents who have kids even though they know they might not come home from school one day because the nra buries red and blue politicians in money while kids and adults just get buried fuck this timeline
they bravely gave their lives to keep nra profitable
if it were of people that died from car wreaks the number would be times as many
theres an easy fix to this and its do able in steps if you are in fear of being killed from gun violence buy a gun get proficient with it carry it on you at all times is it extreme for those that dont wanna carry a gun yes will it save your life god forbid its use is needed absolutely
wow now show the people who haven t been shot
more like r depressingasfuck
no more grayscale shooters
by some i think you mean about this image has about people mass shooting deaths in years is
that s not interesting it s fuckin terrible
funny i don t see a picture of the constitution in there
that is just horrendous to see
make no mistake about it the government doesn t care about these people this is just part of their agenda to take americans rights not to guns and enslave them i don t expect you people to listen
what is it of world population but of world s gun violence usa baby
come on there are way more dead people then that you should use them to make a composite picture of a gun shooting a kid or something
opps
that s only a few months of america s schools
we should fix this with more guns
all hail the second amendment
probably around of all the victims
years looks like same amount like this year only
don t post a similar collage for culprits it ll trigger most people here
now make a collage of the deaths per year from fentanyl and other drugs flowing over the open borders
reminder that almost every single public mass shooter and terrorist has been a conservative male
why can t we as upset about victims of drunk driving fentanyl overdoses or medical malpractice
years for this in america i wonder how many centuries it would take for any other first world country to match this american count for shooting victims
americans are so simple anybody got a picture of the innocent afghan victims iraqis when it s close to their personal lives it s the biggest tragedy and they demand government curtail their fear they fund the biggest killing machine on the planet and have no reflection on it
some
victims of mass over medication of a population with ssris look it up moron key side effect psychosis
ooo now lets do car crashes
plot twist these are just from last month
just kidding all these faces were actually made using a i software
not one single republican cares about them and they would rather have them die again than have gun control
so this picture is showing like a weeks worth

old was cuter
what s harold doing there
in the age of everyone over simplifying their logos india is doing the opposite
a brief overview the above photograph is of ashoka stambh the original stambh is a prominent ancient monument located in the town of sarnath near varanasi in uttar pradesh india it was erected in the 3rd century bce by the mauryan emperor ashoka who ruled over much of the indian subcontinent at that time the ashoka stambh is a tall stone column that stands over meters feet high with a diameter of about meters feet the column is made of polished sandstone and is decorated with four lions which are the national symbol of india the lions are shown standing back to back with their faces turned towards the four cardinal directions the ashoka stambh is considered to be an important symbol of india s cultural and historical heritage and it is also significant for its association with the buddhist religion sarnath is an important pilgrimage site for buddhists as it is believed to be the place where the buddha first taught the dharma his teachings after attaining enlightenment the ashoka stambh is one of several important monuments and temples located in sarnath that are associated with buddhism now coming back to the photograph on the right india is building its new parliament building and it has placed a gigantic ashoka stambh on top of the building the man you see in the first photograph is the prime minister of india mr narendra modi who inaugurated the stambh last year this particular version of the ashoka stambh is made of bronze has an approximate weight of kilograms and is meters in height
that looks cool as hell
more detailed on new one
new one looks like a proper jungle lion who s the king
fun fact the bottom also has four animals if you look closely a horse a bull an elephant and another lion
india remastered graphics are looking great
deleted
there are as political issue about it that modi ji is changing the symbol adding teeth to it and making it look aggressive to scare the muslims in india i have to say i find political debates on news channel more entertaining than daily soap channels they always call a retarded maulana and an autistic pandit to yell at each other super fun
so that s where the tax money goes more and more expensive statues and shit
sholdn t they focus on providing their population with indoor plumbing
i like the old derpy one better

how do the decide which direction to walk with their shared legs
don t see anything interesting as fuckish i mean it s interesting but that s it
the island of misfit toys will be happy
i had to triple check how that horse tail looks on the new one
they failed to capture the part where they re giving putin a hand job
the original looks kind of like the lion of gripsholm castle
modi s just a low rent fascist putin s errand boy
they both look like they were done by a middle school kid who just started working in plaster
that s why it got changed with more aggressive one
not on brand with the fascist regime though
i hate logo simplification
and it s over years old
lions dont live in jungle
bullshit communists had lot of power since independence they basically controlled everything now they re crying because current govt is not bending to them and is slowly going away from russia their powers in india are taken away so they are whining from usa facist country for what taking out india from fragile five economies to top for reducing riots by more than half building infrastructure with 4x speed reducing china dependence building stronger ties with france and going away from russia democracy is much better than ever did facist modi breach democracy and establish dictatorship like previous so called secular non facist party did so called facist govt is the only govt in indian history to get full majority in elections with population voting for them people of nation know who to vote than some india communist shitters in usa barking ask them why didn t people give full majority to fully established party and why people chose a fairly new party of population know who s right and who s not we live and see what going on just because you don t like modi doesn t mean now he s facist incompetent opposition hiding their failure behind gandhi dynasty that ruled india and buried it to ground let me give you example who s facist the previous party which turned down ruling of supreme govt on shah bano case where husband said talak times and they were divorced with court or documentation when court asked govt to change law that party not only turned down the ruling but also literally changed constitution of india to favor muslim male vote bank or the party that outright banned this talak thing and restored constitution as it was
anyone not jumping when the us says jump is termed fascist communist whatever
adding teeth made it more accurate fangless lions exist only in fairy tales and cartoons
what a joke of a comment
yeah right and we love it
bruh shut up what is of people give tax govt never depend on it everything has a budget decided doesnt matter if govt build cultural things current govt parliament lies in earthquake zone built by british without considering it how embarrassing it would be if first thing to fall in earthquake is parliament of india it is necessary either built before disaster or after and this emblem is cherry on top
use the internet to update yourself
yeah we are now how about you focus on yourself
why not both they ve done it and are doing it 4x of speed of previous communist govt we may not be developed but that doesn t means shouldn t be proud of our history past civilisation
they re lions you see symbolising roar and dominance in all direction below lions there is budha chakra of aryan truths and budha fav animals at the side of chakra it is taken from maurya empire capital excavation which existed about years ago
also the part where usa invaded nations and killed a million inocent people in each one of them and now try to act massiah of human rights and preachers to india and asean nations
we all are fascists deal with it and we ll buy more russian oil cope up
it s about year old statue from maurya empire capital excavation taken as indian emblem
what facist regime dipshit
everything right wing is not fascist i get it your parents failed you but no need to share that info
wdym what about asiatic and african jungles
well said terrific write up this bs idea of calling and labeling people as fascist is more of a fashion rather than responsibly using it after due diligence
oh no adding sharp teeth was intentional see the mouth is closed in first one i support a more aggressive national symbol
word mate
govt never depend on it ever heard of indirect taxes you may not pay income tax but even people living in india with some of the lowest wages in the world have to pay indirect taxes through the goods and services they consume forget about the taxes where do you think this budget is coming from some money tree under your house
less embarrassing than having millions of people shitting all over the place because they don t have toilets despite living in a nuclear state with it s own space program
spot on hdi index
where exactly did a communist government come into power have i been living in an alternate reality where cpi formed the government
are you saying that communist govenrnment failed at something
well mashed it even more difficult to go anywhere but seriously both are really cool
you know both can be bad right
no not all indians are fascists but modi is fascism appeals to the uneducated the low iq ed and emotionally insecure baby bitches
is that not modi in the photo
lions never lived in jungles you can find them in steppes and plains and alike lands they would have a hard time hunting in a jungle
yeah i ve heard it so i didn t talk of it i referred to direct tax either way new parliament is still inevitable earthquakes are not indirect and also do not occur under tree in my house and especiallydo not knock before coming
no link between the two you re just being racist phobic for sake of playing down someone if street shifter can make nuclears and space program then we ll take care of that too how about you care about uk and its ever dying economy
and hdi index is all about indoor plumbing eh
you know recent hdi is crap and unreliable when a failed state like pakistan suffering unstable government with people fighting for food and also regretting for separation from india has better score
cpi has been part of the ruling coalition in centre multiple times and majority party in multiple states many times in fact in thier year continuous rule in west bengal cpi succeeded in de industrialing kolkata
you don t need to tell you are communist or socialist its open truth cpi is worse version
most of the things corruption gandhi family dynastic rule no capitalism or industrialisation until usa forced us in 1990s after they made india bankrupt like ussr making india russia dependent breach of democracy in 1970s with emergency dictatorship
there s nothing bad in geopolitics it s always what favors nation and it s interest if russian sanctions help us get cheap oil and keep our inflation in control then it s right
indians voted for modi that s highest in independent indian history 2nd only to first prime minister and modis highest vote share comes from tier and cities then rural india you re wrong on all fronts
mf do you even know the defininition of facism how does he qualify as a dictator
ah yes fascism because indians don t subscribe to your preferred leftist liberal ideology
yeah but jungles doesn t necessarily mean like amazon rainforest right i mean congo basin is a jungle and has lions ig
jungle is a hindi word which originated from sanskrit word jangala jangala means rough and arid land
sorry to break the news for you but lions in india did live in jungle
earthquakes are not indirect and also do not occur under tree in my house and especiallydo not knock before coming was not my question but yes if an earthquake occurs in delhi you will be dead but atleast hey atleast the parliament will be up
toilets aren t a race i am shitphobic though as for there being no link who has the responsibility for constructing public sanitation and finding the funds to pay for it the street shifters who just finished building a nuclear icbm in their rural village if you don t want people to talk about your country and its batshit crazy politics then you shouldn t have posted a picture of narendra modi standing next to an aggressive national symbol
it absolutely is in the low range without it you have low life expectancy and high infant mortality
yeah could be it s a soft index pakistan is worse than india in probably every category
bro no development is happening communist or not all these politicians are corrupt as fuck
so you re saying it s ok to support the russian government as they brutally invade sovereign counties just because your government benefits from it you re also ok with how the us installed dictators all over the world and is indirectly responsible for millions of innocent deaths because the us government benefited
everything s fine https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/12dk324/indian_textbooks_purged_of_material_modis_party/)
he s a fascist because he s a fascist just own it bro
your question answered in first lines if earthquake occur you ll be dead along with prime minister of india at that time or maybe you re pissed on the fact bjp will still be in center less damage than damage also british didn t take earthquake in context while building it but new business and builders do take it imagine if all buildings are standing with some damage but prime minister is dead also old buildings will be meusuim and tourist places
what modi has to do with toilets or muclear or space program or national emblem there s no link between them he s prime minister of india why would he not stand in front while inauguration who does it in you nation we have responsibility to construct them so both things can happen simultaneously its billion people not mill and it was modi who built toilets in india https://www.statista.com/chart/14924/indias-toilet-building-revolution/ another reason for him to stand in front of lion emblem toilets aren t race but point things out of nowhere with no reason is just being playing down someone
so you got absolutely no info about what work has been done on the rant you ranted about and when asked more details you go making comments take your stupid attitude to where the sun doesn t shine sure will be a treat for folks around you to see your face when you ll learn about your rants being invalid and phased out long back
kanpur metro got built in f ing years and your saying no development is happening there s at least projects that got stalled in upa and bjp got them back on track you re on some dope stuff
agreed modi in last years has become soft congress but less corruption is better than rampant corruption its choosing between lesser evil
if us themselves can invade for oil than we can just buy oil from russia we arent invading nor are we responsble we can t let our people suffer from inflation for ukrainians and ukraine has always supported pakistan that is another reason usa is buying oil products from india that we buy from russia so you are too responsible japan has now considered buying oil from russia too if it s between my population and ukrainians we ll choose ours
would you prefer to talk about the rise of indian fascist nationalism
i got tow words for you indoor plumbing
you do know how big india is and how much more things on the root level are yet to be corrected these little things are mere a percent to what needs to be done and statue and ram mandir weren t those
every man for themselves or fuck you got ours got it also just stop with the what aboutism just because a group does something doesn t mean it s ok i don t support the purchases from the the us or japan either and not to get into geo politics but a quick search shows that russia seems pretty friendly with pakistan just saying
keep changing the topics unrelated to post
tow words yeah keep it up retard can t think beyond it can t look up info about it now go ahead correct your response else people will get to know about your desperation level
what do you think the new idea image represents with modi stood next to it
typo you win you got me
he s the fucking prime minister inaugurating new parliament who else is supposed to do it janitor there are few images available comparing old and new lion capitol and includes pm whats your problem with him he s our pm we ll manage whatever he is however he is if of indians voted for him than you do not need to worry he s the only pm who got that percent after first pm

im confused
this is such a lot of nothing
what s the basis of your conclusion have you reviewed thousands of computers or is it an internet based fact
x2
think of it as a software easter egg
for whatever it is worth that document is present on my mac running ventura
it is on my mac running monterey
what s the basis of your comment have you done any research on the topic or is it just a knee jerk reaction
op says that apparently apple had that pdf document saved on every mac product catalina and newer without most users knowing it it s just a whitepaper though it is interesting why they chose that document if its just for sample purposes a white paper is a report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body s philosophy on the matter it is meant to help readers understand an issue solve a problem or make a decision wikipedia
just wondering how op knows this is on every mac running catalina or newer and no i m doing any research on it because it s sounds like a lot of nothing if there is no information to validate the claim plus i don t use mac anymore so i don t care

like when a octopus throws their sexual appendix away towards the female to inseminate her
one time someone pulled a gun on me and i came same thing
this is what plants would masturbate to if they had eyes
suicide for everyone who s allergic to pollen lol
my boyfriend needed his asthma spray during the night and couldn t figure out why now i know why
and then shook its semen out onto a mirror for entertainment
that sounds so innocent pollenography
agreed insert sexy moan
hitting it hard makes the pollen spill more yeah
me too itchy eyes just by looking at video
just make a line lol
nah the cool part of that is she just holds onto as many octodicks as she wants until she chooses which one to use to self inseminate
bang your welcome
i m something of a plant myself

someone found mommy s adderall
that domino finger is itching
stonehenge where the demons dwell where the banshees live and they do live well stonehenge where a man s a man and the children dance to the pipes of pan
what is this a stonehenge for ants
one small kid is all it takes
i didn t read the heading and my mind processed this as some massive gathering of tons of people around some huge ancient structure i may be going insane
domino and stone should team up
not fer nuthin but there are actual ancient stone circles all over devon and cornwall i went to several of them while visiting england and they were wonderful dartmoor is a special place
park rangers are pleading people not to do shit like this beaches i guess bit ok but it disrupts bug life and ecosystems
for those in other countries devon is in uk
why the shit music
garbage ass music should be natural ocean sounds
i m getting a boner thinking about knocking that shit down
i love kicking these stupid fucking things down
fuck those stupid songs
knock it down
lol looks like something a bunch of kids put together
juust a little smurf kick with my finger
when she says she likes finding stone stacks on the beach lol
i remember this pebble beach from my childhood visiting family in devon
look at all those skipping stones
its either beesands or slapton sands in south devon that i can tell you why the aliens chose it is another matter
so much effort to tell the world you re unemployed
no one knows who they were or what they were doing
pray to god i never find the location of that
this is shitty this person just collected all these stones here surely destroying some local flora and fauna hey let me collect all the rocks out of the river where the fish and turtles like to live and hide to make this super fucking cool duck shit pisses me off if you want to see a duck go hiking
the view itself is nice i don t understand the need to ruin beautiful videos with music same happens when some people save an animal no need to enhance the emotion with music just let the people enjoy
this what my unemployed friend is doing on a wednesday at 30am
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mbyzgeee2mg wtf is a stonehenge
that looks nothing like stone henge
because of the music im going to hop in my john deer tractor with a magnum and drive here specifically to destroy this art or what ever the fuck it is
legend has it that the stones used in this site s construction came from hundreds of yards away archeologists are baffled as to how primitive people could have accomplished such a feat
meth is a helluva drug
someone was bored
https://www.southhams.com/blog/general-news/mystery-sculpture-appears-on-beach at torcross in devon happy all
that s my name don t wear it out
don t let me anywhere near this place
amazing that this has been allowed to stand for years without anyone disturbing it
andy goldsworthy comments incoming
oh reddit is going to cry about this i guarantee it
watch out or you ll piss off some hardcore hiker
thank you for sharing
they got the idea from spinal tap
now to find the video of those super rational people who go around kicking stacked rocks over like there saving the freaking whales on this set up
my name is devon and i thought u were talking to me lmaoo
plowing down these stones and stone stacks is so satisfying they just feel so unnatural and it s soothing to bring back the natural entropy of stones and rocks
do we know if devon saw this post yet can someone confirm
i want to do this now
greenpeace how dare you to change the environment these stones had a good life laying around for thousands of years pffffff
who is singing this song i can t find it anywhere
this is why all of the whales are dying good job you just killed whales they have to go on to the beach to lay their egg pod which will cause the whales to be trapped underneath those rocks and drown
i was honestly expecting the camera to pan overhead and reveal it to be in the pattern of amogus
humans
technically it s quite big
hikers will really see this and destroy it
we are all thinking the same right we really want to be there and do it
teenage boys would love ten minutes here
be careful someone from a museum in england might try stealing section of it
aliens
lots of stones in a row
someone found out devon is shit when the sun s not out especially torquay at least you can look at pissed off damp animals in the zoo in paignton highlight traffic in brixham closely followed by traffic out brixham
all the anti cairn people seeing this are foaming from the mouth at record speed
should probably knock this shit down when you re done https://www.blueplanetsociety.org/rock-stacking-denies-people-the-experience-of-wildness/
how long until a chaos influencer comes and knocks it over for likes
sandy bay beach
archeologists in the future be like yep this is made billions years
my internal brain is having a battle between art is art and leave no trace im strongly anti rock stacking but i also respect hard work that brings people joy im curious where my line is
fucking people
huge mini stonehenge
there must not be any kids or cats in devon
hauska
mini
mini
a mini stonehenge that looks nothing like stonehenge
song name
me resisting the urge to kick it down
literally everyone in here wants to kick it over
i should pray here this is so giving
long
more like i ll spell it wrong gobekli tempi
i don t think the choreography was the issue i think the issue might have been that there was a stonehenge monument on stage that was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf
wow someone had a lot of time on their hands and we know some ass will come and knock it all down
shrooms
some good skimming stones right there
im gonna flick it
pls no
r thingsforants
came here here for this comment
i was gonna say yr old me would have a fucking field day
r kidsarefuckingevil
i m all it takes
haha you ok buddy but wait let me get this straight you thought the little stones were people
for the briefest moment i too saw megastructures and a whole bunch of people
yes not too dissimilar from the mottled puce colour you see in aerial shots of a large music festival
dementia
there are a bunch of henges dotted around the british isles fun fact stonehenge isn t called stonehenge because it s a henge made of stones but rather all henges are called henges because of stonehenge naming something this way is called a backformation and i know more about the etymology than the henges themselves lmao
i live right next to it it s indeed a special place
it ruins the view for me at least nature is fine without little piles of rock everywhere

israel s response lol no
oh ya because they ll listen to a petition
out of countries in the un
i ll tell you what s interesting as fuck the fact op didn t mention unhrc s history it s like saying i was talking to this guy the other day and he absolutely hates israel his name louis farrakhan but why is that important
wtf is wrong with the uk and usa both voting no it tells you everything you need to know
where s canada
how come reddit ain t calling out us and others for voting no but readily call out every other country double standards
if both countries are smart and really know the agenda they should come in and make a deal not only this will actually make them an idol for the rest of the world but they will relieve the stronghold west has on middle east sacrificing the youngs is not a solution fucking end this war and let the world know you are not a puppet and do it now
not interesting whatsoever the votes have been in this order for approximately a decade or so nothing will change with these resolutions
ok explain in nfl terms
deleted
west bank settlements i can imagine one day being stopped but not with this current israeli government but i can t imagine any even the most liberal and compromising israeli government giving up east jerusalem
wow this data speaks pretty loudly
while that may be the case the uk and us voting no is rich considering they call out discrimination and violence against minorities in certain countries
only when it suits them
both have close intelligence ties to israel neither country is going to cross israel anytime soon it s obvious not an excuse and i m not defending the no votes it s just kind of to be expected i went looking to see how those two voted not because i was actually curious but to confirm exactly how i expected them to vote
countries back allies not morals
just north of the usa
this is literally a post on reddit doing that thing
that s called politics in the us dictatorships in others
i think if they were going to make a deal it would ve happened during the last millennia of conflict why would israel make a deal anyway they seem to be winning from the clips of israeli attacks i see
right maybe start by revoking any future aid to israel or egypt or any of the regional actors involved
of course the us and uk aren t going to they supply weapons to have the world
things change an underdog can dominate in many scenarios things that didn t happen in a millennia are still achievable and seldom happen often it s not an easy deal to accomplish but if people from the both countries are united and don t play the political bs from both countries they can make it happen israel should understand sometimes losing is winning especially when it comes to the well being of its people and palestine should understand any deal that can stop the bloodshed is a win here s to the hope as i raise my glass to all the people that are lost in this fabricated war we are only strong together no matter what religion region gender colour or race
yeah honestly at this point how do you fix it it s been going on over that piece of land for literally thousands of years between the jews and the arabs this is just the latest revision of it it s never going to end
so they continue this two faced agenda of allowing discrimination and violence to happen because they want to control the world via weapons and then call out discrimination and violence against countries who don t follow them like puppies yep
why do think it s been ongoing for so long external powers keep funding the region as soon as europe and the us stop arming the regimes in the region you d stop hearing about it let them fight it out amongst themselves
just the perks of being a superpower i guess
bro never heard of politics
absolutely yet people are absolutely convinced that they can trust the us and uk government when they say that nato didn t provoke russia in the slightest and they really don t like war fuck putin obviously but i don t trust the british or us governments in any scenario
first off this post isn t all that interesting secondly the same hypocrisy could be said for most of the countries voting yes and people like you who call out israel for occupation but don t care about other occupations or other conflicts which kill far more people
yep the perk of being a cunt
oh yes a well armed bunch of cunts

and still not properly centered the northern now southern hemisphere is still way bigger than the other when they should be the exact same size
nz in its rightful place nice
yet proportionally incorrect
it looks exactly like a seahorse giving birth
and making these was apparently easier than just looking at a map upside down
damn it australian
now we all can see the truth america is a big duck
sadly it s still a modified mercator aka the north american military map turned upside down bleh
i can feel all my former hemisphere privilege just melting away
well there is no up or down in space so not really upside down
deleted
flat earthers were right can be anyway and still work omg
i d bet if that was put on a scifi tv show movie in the background or some display for the characters to point out objectives most including me wouldn t recognize it as earth
australia pov
finally a map for australians
excuse me the correct name for this map is the australian map
trip to australia is now heading up over
is there any up side map but with the correct proportions edit i mean one up side map with the same incorrect proportions were used to wouldn t nz looked as big as greenland
wait until they correctly scale the extremes
i m from california for some reason this map seems a lot more intuitive to my orientation perspective of the world
disproportionate africa is waaaay bigger
mercator projection is somewhere between misleading and total garbage
that s what i was looking for gotta watch out for the one always being forgotten
i will never be able to unsee that
well can t unsee that a duck wearing pants
no they point to the north pole and south pole the axis our planet rotates on
back in the day and still today more cartographers live d and work ed north of the equator than more southerly but we haven t any inca global maps afaik sad
and north and south will sometime swap every few hundred thousand years the magnetic poles reverse
but it still works if its round
for a real nightmare flip a new york city transit map upside down many locals would fall off the edge no doubt
it was designed to display accurate compass bearings for sea travel
https://manoa.hawaii.edu/exploringourfluidearth/physical/world-ocean/map-distortion/compare-contrast-connect-map-orientation-and-shape
came here to say this
i didn t know that thanks for sharing the knowledge i stand by my opinion of it being garbage though caveat being in the current era most of us aren t sailors
thing is every map projection is misleading in some way as you can t project a sphere onto a flat surface without introducing distortion mercator does also retain the shapes of continents ecker iv is perhaps one of the better map projections it projects relative size without introducing too much distortion of shapes but it s still something of a compromise https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eckert_iv_projection#/media/file:ecker_iv_projection_sw.jpg
not to mention the earth isn t a true sphere

i dont see the equatorial trench leading to the reactor core
the death star was built a long time ago in a galaxy far far away that leaves plenty of time to leave a duplicate in our solar system
identical
mimas is totally an ancient alien artifact that s was adrift in the cosmos then captured by our solar system s gravitational influence ending up as one of saturn s many moons billions of years of interstellar dust accumulation merely masks the power of this fully operational battle station
that s no moon oh wait
identical seems to be loosely used here
kinda playing it fast and loose with that word
that s no moon
many bothans died to bring us this information
that s exactly what the empire wants you to think
identical exactly the same in every way
a moon with an asteroid crater isn t that far fetched
that s no saturn s moon
i don t know man looks like death star been hanging out around saturn collecting dust to me a long time a go in a galaxy pretty damn close to home
i m not sure you know what identical means
the at t logo however is no accident
op doesn t understand what identical means
rip alderaan
crazy they are almost the exact same size to
clearly god is a star wars fan
it is possible that george lucas saw a fuzzy version or an artists conception of the moon based on data or possibly lucas is an alien from a technologically advanced society who came here to recruit for the star wars
is it too late for a that s no moon reference
that is not a moon
what woulda caused that
that s just what they want you to think
that s no moon
thats no coincidence thats a space station
you re telling me that whoever made mimas copied the plans from the deathstar
that s no moo no wait i guess it is
a long time ago in a galaxy not so far away
that s no moon
so no copyright infringement
i live where george lucas grew up knowing that and driving around seeing aged wooden spools the big ones the use for fences flipped on their sides looking like starfighters taking the bart into sf and seeing the cranes look like walkers the sound of the wheels bew bew bew like the blasters and going in the tunnel under the bay watching the lights zoom by like light speed i could be totally tripping but i do think i see where some of the inspiration may have come from when looking around this area he grew up
the us deep state wants you to believe it s a coinkidink but that cold war star wars program actually worked
that s just what they want you to think
lucas accidentally saved an entire moon getting called a boob forever
you keep using that word
identical is doing a lot of heavy lifting
that s no moon
that s no moon
we have very different definitions of identical
that s no moon
identical similar
boobies
if that looks identical to you then you need to get your eyes checked
yes coincidence certainly not a fully operational battle station
someone needs to acquaint themselves with the definition of identical
funny how people think it s coincidence
can confirm was stationed on the death star
coincidence my ass
makes me think of the size of this death star and found it s about the size of puck a moon of u ranus would the mass be such that the focusing disc would gather space dust debris like navel fluff
so what your saying is nasa designed mimas to look like the death stare
he had me at boobies
that s george lucas s home planet
but is it a coincidence
mmm yes coincidence
death star is flat
is this canon
simple answer mimas copied star wars
looks like wikipedia logo to me
nasa spokesman david we have the technology the time is now science can wait no longer children are our future america can should must and will blow up the moon
that s no moon
that s no moon
life imitates art
that s no moon oh wait yes it is
identical is a bit of a stretch
did you know the death star had lightspeed equipment was capable of hyperspace travel they sure don t mention that n the films
that s not a moon it s a space station
but the lizard people that run hollywood knew this is evidence save this on an external and hide it immediately get off the grid they know
just like it s purely coincidence that there s a silhouette of pluto the dog on the planet pluto
life imitating art
here we go again
probably more accurate to say photo was released in
george lucas knew kubrick through his hollywood connects kubrick filmed the moon landing they never said which moon they were landing on
i fucking knew star wars was real
yeah that sounds like something the empire would say
or that is the remains of a space station that was created a long time ago in a galaxy far far away that took eons to travel into our galaxy causing it to degrade into something that looks like a moon
im starting to think that galaxy is not so far far away after all
anybody seen red
the coincidence comment seems odd yes the death star may have not been modeled after the moon due to the photos coming years later but that s doesn t rule out the moon being modeled after the movie have you thought about that
no coincidence this moon copied star wars
ferb i know what we re gonna do today
issa megastructure
yeah that s what they tell you s
also mimas was formed probably billions of years ago or whatever wikipedia would say about it
deleted
thats no moon its a space sta no wait its a moon my bad
if you enjoy morgan freeman s voice and like space shit there s a thing on netflix where he talks about this moon getting fucked up
this is pure coincidence that s what they want you to believe
the way the title was written i thought it was from r shittymoviedetails
stupid it s built almost done
also the plans for the death star were drawn up a long long time ago
or mimas watched star wars coincidence then
the lizard people know
i can t tell is that a moon or is that no moon are they both moons or are they both no moons
that s no space station
it s just a ball with one big dent in it
i mean it was long long ago so we re just finally catching up to the reality that george originally came from in his time machine
there is still a lot of work until the death star can be inaugurated

cool tornadoes are endlessly fascinating to me right around the second mark you can see where it crossed the street he s on due to the roughed up dirt
i am pretty sure your mother told you not to do that anymore
awesome
desert whirlwinds rarely reach the ferocity of a great plains tornado wee little windstorms attacking northern california s wine country usually aren t too bad but big twisters get fierce protip do not approach tornado move away quickly or take refuge is your insurance paid up
i hold the same fascination i know they aren t the same but i m even fascinated by dust devils also cool name

so what you re saying is that flourite is flour escent yeah that checks out
alexandrite does this too
i m going to assume that it looks better irl
thats how you snatch it from a shop and run away
don t bring it near dialga please
diamonds can have fluorescence properties as well it s pretty cool
now i gotta take all my crystals outside
that s cool thanks for sharing
may be helpful if you shine an artificial light through it from behind show that the crystals either do dont have a blue tint to them when not in the sunlight to me it almost looks like they are blue already just brighter outside and allows you to see the tint i think it would be more impressive if you can show the color inside a bit better
hmmm where the fuck was this crystal for blm
pimp purple
haha yes that is where the word fluorescence came from lol
alexandrite isn t quite the same phenomenon but good quality alexandrites will change color in different lighting like incandescent and fluorescent lighting
haha i guess it s not as impressive on the video did you see the change though
ye p
another interesting fact is that fluorite contains fluoride that is used in some oral health products these product use synthesized fluoride most of the time
i saw the change really nice my favourite colour too thanks for the share

so what was the point of the 12th empty coffin
the executioners were master sergeant john c woods and his assistant military policeman joseph malta woods miscalculated the lengths for the ropes used for the executions some alleging intentionally such that some of the men did not die quickly of an intended broken neck but instead strangled to death slowly wiki
a missed opportunity to mix their ashes into porcelain and make public toilets out of them
then using axes and their boots they carefully smashed the urns into fragments i think one of these words might not be entirely accurate
they respawned in call of duty as zombies to be eternally murdered by teenagers chugging energy drinks
i still can t believe goering cheated the hangman by using cyanide didn t they search his mouth for it
you d be surprised by how many nazi s got away without punishment some of them were even rewarded and given jobs within the u s government
source of video is mark felton great videos on youtube
george munger was actually the name of my ap english teacher in high school
should have given them jewish names
they moved to argentina
kind of like what they did with osama bin laden burial at sea so that they had no place to congregate and worship his memory
i woulda pissed on them and thrown them into an unmarked grave same shit those cocksuckers did
what i wouldn t give to be a fly on the wall of the officers handling this shit it must have been such a relief that everything was coming to an end
they were boiled until soft placed in a wine press and strained and then pressed into tins labeled canned assholes the tins were then unceremoniously tossed into pig shit ponds
hanging was way too easy on them
yeah can t make them martyrs similar thing with bin laden don t want to make a shrine where they can be worshipped
so why one empty coffin
i mean toilets work too guys
what about the ones who founded nasa and the cia
complicated for sure just flush the content of the earns in to the toilet and be done
did the reason become clear i watched this twice
disposed of like nazi garbage should be
i didnt know there was google maps in ww2 kidding aside thanks for sharing this is indeed very interesting
cremated and their ashes scattered in the river
did i miss the point in the 12th coffin
not a whole lot of nazi leaders were hanged many escaped and that s the problem
for those who don t know the reason why each grave was given false identity was because had they been given the actual names they become severely defaced and vandalized
op can i we get a link i wanna see more
they should ve been cremated in the same ones that were used on the jews
my grandpa was a guard at the door for these trials
we need to start hanging war criminals again
to hell with the nazis
love mark felton s videos his voice is perfect for his videos on war history
does anyone know a good documentary telling about the post hitler era and how the country got rid of his legacy
i would have taken the ashes and thrown them in the garbage yard
sometimes i feel like the government just yearns to waste taxpayer money and make soldiers do completely pointless things
mark felton s videos are awesome highly suggest watching on youtube for anyone interested in military history
i would have driven to a garbage dump not pollute a river
they lived nice lives in washington dc
sounds too peaceful i would ve flushed them in a public toilet
what is the source i want to see more like this
mark felton that voice gets my history juices flowing
carefully smashed with their boots lolol
why not implant some acorns into them before throwing them into a ditch so that they can compensate for all the oxygen they wasted throughout their worthless and pathetic lives
it sounds like they were following the ritual to kill some kinda of undead creature to make sure they stayed perma dead were the nazis led by vampires all along
they went and created nasa and sent america to the moon
it would have been poetic if they were cremated at one of the death camps they should have been told of their body s fate prior to their hanging i wonder how they would have felt knowing they would be incinerated by the same fire that they tried to use to cover up their horrific deeds
ground up made in to patties put on the grill put in a bun nurembergers
the nazi leaders not taken to the us to run nasa that is
crazy how much more respect was shown to them than any of their victims seems like a waste of time and money when large hole would ve done a great job or just drop them at sea with some heavy boots on
should ve dumped the ashes into a sewage tank
bend over and i ll show you
they should have cremated them while they were still alive
should ve fed them alive to herds of pigs bury the resulting nazi pigshit in landfills
they ve be been reanimated and are currently running the united states i believe
if it was anything less than a pit in the breeding ground of skull humping coyotes it was too generous the world would have literally been a better place if they were never born
but then you find out operation paper clip was used by the cia to bring many nazi scientists to the us and south america and many are credited to aiding the us to get to space lol
i can hear his intro song
why not just dump them in a pile like their victims
putting them feet deep right after hanging was not an option why give them such a special ceremony
are putin and his friends next
being sent to argentina d
hopefully buried under a long drop toilet so everyone can shit on them
seems so excessive should have just dumped them somewhere random and buried them with a bulldozer
i feel like we should have a cemetery just for all the world s biggest assholes
seems pointless why not dump their ashes in a landfill where they belong
a lot of wasted time man power and money why not cremate and dump them in the trash like they did to so many others cheap and easy why treat them as important after they are ash
i m in the military in the video there is a truck with a headlight out that s means it s deadlined now they would never let a truck drive like that unless it s an emergency i wonder when that became a thing
their corpses should have been desecrated in horrible manners
shouldve shitted on the ashes first
just wait until you hear about operation paperclip or just google it just be thankful for the nazis that helped us beat russia to the moon
got it so they burned fake nazi bodies and then relocated all of them to argentina to live out their lives and sent the intelligent scientist to america under operation paperclip
boy that was a lot of unnecessary for video
papa showed me videos of this back home in argentina said the stupid americans thought he died then wow poeple can t take jokes y all some bitches
they were sent to south america to be resurrected and live amongst their friends some were resurrected and worked as nato officials
meh we should ve taken the vlad tepes approach with them we got plenty of them still kicking around in america if we want a re do
executed for following orders and doing their job
soylent green
they moved to the us and became democrats
well those war criminals either fled to the united states or became the leaders of nato i m serious
the nazis already have q anon they don t need any more conspiracies
who cares
anyone else imagine they were set free
deleted
they never said why there was a twelfth empty coffin also just love the way they say americans commandeered that man s house at the end in any other language it would be called theft
why are we supposed to care so much about jews
a true travesty they were beaten and tortured until they confessed to things they never did
don t care
cult of gohreing was a legitimate possibility
this guy s channel on youtube is great if you like ww2 history https://www.youtube.com/@markfeltonproductions](https://www.youtube.com/@markfeltonproductions) also the operations room for historical battle play by plays https://www.youtube.com/@theoperationsroom](https://www.youtube.com/@theoperationsroom)
that was a weird way of saying they all got ferried away to argentina
good question now i want to know too
i love mark felton productions
why the river use the toilet
angry coffins
embalmed and worshipped in kreml
mark felton productions always
who gives af

tbh i fucking love courtroom drawings
what kind of likeness is that corrado junior uncle june soprano
i wish they could better capture the wispiness of his hair it s like half eaten cotton candy
he must be running low on orange
that addition of green to trump s mug is perfection
they nailed the hair with his true baldness coming through
captured the one lawyers five head pretty well
amazing how skilled these people are i wonder how much that original drawing is worth
looks like a deep sea angler fish
he is cannon fodder for cartoonists now
captured trump s fundamental ugliness
he looks like a toad lmao
we need the artist that did the full size sculptures of him https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160818/union-square/meet-man-behind-naked-donald-trump-statue.amp](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160818/union-square/meet-man-behind-naked-donald-trump-statue.amp)
serious this is someone s job right like actually courtroom artist
r oddlyterrifying
the trump who stole democracy
i have to ask and it s fine if i m downvoted a lot for asking but i understand this is a big deal in the us it s historical even but does anyone outside the united states care about this i mean other than a cursory glance at the headline and maybe reading a bit about it i m only asking because i ve seen so many threads about this on here today and i keep thinking i feel like no one outside the us gives a rat s ass
joe don baker
i m watching you wazowski
he looks like rozz from monsters inc
weeesa no like a da nabooo
look s like he s about to belt out poor unfortunate souls
op you wanna give credit to the artist you took this from
they make them to be much angrier unhappy than they were in the video
oh wow another trump post
lol
they really captured his good side
is being bald really that much worse than the current disaster on his head
i m disappointed they didn t add that big ole vein to the lawyer it s going to make for some really good political caricatures lol
this will be the one that stands the test of time to be put into history books
why are courtroom artists a thing we ve had cameras for a very longtime is there a reason other than tradition
he always wanted to be teflon don here you go buddy
why doesn t he have six pack abs like the nft grift he advertised last year i thought he was jacked
donald trump lifelong victim
i kinda want a giant canvas print of this on my wall
you can really see the anger and hatred on trump s face
angry orange frog face
every god damn time someone seeps american politics under the vague idea it belongs on a sub adding to how mundane this website has become
not really interestingasfuck but fairly decent art nonetheless
he look like the evil owl from rockadoodle
there he is the hammerhead dipshit
you can see how much the artist had to fight the urge to add horns
the fattest pumpkin
he looks like a fucking toad
he looks like the evil gremlin that he is
he needs to be fatter and more wrinkly
someone needs to draw in other villains from dick tracy
not enough orange for the fat melon
lol i love they still do this thing haha
i don t get how he s on trial he hugged and dry humped the american flag pretty sure that grants you immunity
grump trump
who picasso in the faces are terrible and will haunt my nightmares thanks
certainly no bias in manhattan
not orange enough
make him look sus as fuck i got u fam
boys in blue getting bj s back left
i wonder which way the artist leans politically
i m going to have this reprinted as a portrait and hang it up next to my shitter bathroom
drew one of the cops like kazuya mishima
so spot on could barely tell the difference between this and the real pictures
i m going to nft this bihs
was he crying
that s pretty spot on what his face looks like
better quality here https://i.imgur.com/rxfkzbo.png
ill be real looks more like soros
whyd he get arrested
how long until the comments on this post are turned off
i m sure the sketcher didn t insert is own thoughts into trump s expression
you guys sure this isn t a photo
you re a mean one mr trump you really are a heel you re as cuddly as a cactus and as charming as an eel mr trump you re a bad banana with a greasy black peel
very grinchy
us economy is collapsing and ppl are worrying abt a single politician lmao
best day ever
what a hateful little toad he is
trump winning in would definitely own the libs
domo arigato sensei
he looks like if my balls caught fire
looking like rygel from farscape
toad with a wig in a wide cut suit
more like grump amirite
corpulent and odious it s perfect
such a garbage human being even the ink to draw that picture was a waste you could have saved a bunch of time and used a picture of dog shit that s like a mirror image
bragg in the background perfect so well done
i want a framed print for my wall
i want this on a t shirt
this is the presidential portrait that should hang in the white house
just a former president being charged at his arraignment topping off his diaper
can t wait for him to win in
god he looks like a ham sandwich that s been hit with a tennis racket
he really captured the grinch like qualities of the guy
face like a bulldog licking piss off a nettle
lack of orange pencils
sad clown face
alvin bragg ain t gonna last very long corrupt
hope the biden s are paying attention because the first republican president after biden will have hunter and the old senile one up on charges asap what goes around comes around karma if you will
fuckface lol
this is far from being interesting as fuck
i m thinking those court artists must not get paid much

burn it
on the up side you ve happened upon a delicious new source of protein
you need to figure out what type of termite they are formosan or eastern subterranean man if they re formosan then you need to get the neighbors involved as well seriously formosan eat far more than the eastern subterranean at a rate of up to 10xs we had a formosan issue and they literally ate the bottom out of a deep electric pole causing it to become unstable and brittle if i remember the termite pest control guy said they can eat up to 200lbs a month of wood vs a year as native species eat hey build satellite nests with up to 1million termites up to 100yrds away anyway my post is probably far too serious for reddit but seriously my man of this is a real post and that is your fence don t wait around
and it was delicious
based termites dissolving human boundaries
was going to say fence day one house at end of week i d get a professional in
bruh do you always just leave your key fob on the end of a porch like that that s how you lose shit
this suddenly isn t interesting anymore now that my house could look like this
they are most likely subterranean judging by the mud inside the wood they build mud tuves to travel through since they need moisture to survive dude should deff get it checked out anyways hello fellow termite tech
yes your moving them to your deck treat everything or they will take over a flase wood pile way away can get a colony to move that s all the info i have though good luck

got stuck right there in a blizzard once coming back from fishbone in reno had to sleep in my friends van had walking pneumonia the next day it was clear in reno when we left beautiful in sacramento next day
that s cannibal high snow
how deep was it you know that year
do you think they used the new transpacific tunnel
please no not again
i m referring to water equivalent not total snowfall or snow depth there is quite a difference snow water equivalent is the depth of water that would cover the ground if the snow cover was in a liquid state
no but it will be logarithmic there s no way this doesn t create at least some problems downriver
foothills and western slope should be fine central valley is going to have issues though a lot of crops are already underwater
fine like every years
water equivalent is different than snow depth there s lots of air in that
snowpack is of average this year far from normal second biggest winter since
completely different watershed
ummm you would need to pump it uphill through the mojave desert
now we have trans tunnels woke the fuck is going on s
oh sorry
bruh california has it rough when it isnt dry has hell its underwater and also people from california
ahh i see what you mean
trans tunnels trans fats trans mutations trans people no one knows what the fuck is going on these days lol
lol no need to apologize shit gets confusing
how did you forget about all of the missions of trans
we bow to the snow yoda
and the formers axles parents fers and mogrifications

time not important only life important
i cynically think our need to memorialize the dead with elaborate rituals and burial stashes is silly yet when my cat died years ago it felt so wrong to just bury him with no ceremony or additions his skeleton now rests with his food dish because of the incredibly unlikely chance that if anyone discovers his bones i want them to know he was loved
once a thriving international trade hub the archeological site of hegra also known as mada in saleh has been left practically undisturbed for almost years after which toe tapping belgian anthem pump up the jam was released
imagine riding through the desert on a camel and you see a foot tall boulder and think that would make a great temple someone bring me my chisels
aziz light
more stuff and history here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hegra_%28mada%27in_salih%29#19th_century
you can go there on google earth and actually go inside it s just one empty room but the structure is impressive none the less
is it weird that this reminded me of breath of the wild
i can t understand why this is largely unvisited the visible roads and infrastructure make visiting super easy
remains largely unvisited i was there last month and there were at least bus tours per day and a gift shop
except for once every yrs when milla jovovich stops in to save the universe
my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
how big is that looks pretty big
was this used in 5th element it s familiar
i have been there amazing
unvisited there are busloads of tourists every day visiting the place it s often necessary to book the ticket in advance as they get sold out saudi govermnet promotes this place heavily as probably the most important tourism spot in the country
fascinating
i would love to visit that
what you talking about it s a huge tourism draw loads of people see it every year
can i visit it safely
thamud
it this the tomb from that one transformer movie
no this is from diablo ii act
largely unvisited surrounded by tire tracks
i mean like damn dude
wasn t this in prince of persia
reminds me of tip of the library from avatar the last airbender
amazing
hidden gem thanks for sharing
qasir who this is tal rasha s tomb the real tal rasha s tomb
diablo act
wait til one of the dune sequels films there and they ll be tourists everywhere actually might work for the shrine that paul builds that contains leto s skull
for some reason i hear the intro from metallicas one when looking at this
look upon my works ye mighty and despair
the scale is difficult to grasp in the thumbnail that looked like a rock on a beach
aziz light
you have to see this fabulous documentary podcast from fall of civilizations the nabataeans the final days of petra https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsffq02pk4s).
i thought this was a tiny rock carving at first and then i realized just how zoomed out this photo is
i ll visit it
well hell this is just fucking metal
ozymandias vibes
i think that landscape looks as fascinating as the random rock carved into a tomb are there more in those other rocks or was that just a off
i m not going to go i didn t even know that guy
look on my works ye mighty and despair
i just finished listening to fall of civilizations podcast about the nabataeans and their rise and fall highly recommend it will bring this pic to life
spirit temple anyone
so many of the largest deserts in the world are unexplored beyond surface mapping and satellite imagery who knows what lies beneath a few feet of sand under some random sand dune
yogurt i hate yogurt
my wife and i went in and it was amazing maybe saw people total while we were there there is also a completely abandoned town on the outskirts of al ula that we walked around next to the rebuilt tower
ancient aliens made an episode about this historical site they said it was an alien portal or something which i found pretty funny
and on the pedestal these words appear my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair nothing beside remains round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away
needs a banana for scale
maybe because it s hard to get to and that s probably a good thing we humans tend to defile old and new stuff quite rapidly without remorse
i recently read a poem where the main theme is exactly this wish i could remember the author or even any of the lines for help finding it again
why does this give me ai art vibes
why can t billionaires fund research into this stuff there s so much we don t know about our own history
hey maybe stop beheading people publicly and imprisoning others for life because they tweeted some mean things these might help juice the tourist numbers i ve said mean things about mbs on reddit so i sure as heck won t set foot in sa and i love deserts
i d imagine it s not visited much bc who wants to support a country like sa with tourism dollars
when i play minecraft the first thing i do is dig into any nearby hill to get a shelter then gradually hollow it out and fancy it up and remodel it till very often after i ve been playing for a while the original hill often barely or only half exists i think you can see what i m getting at
everything s cool until the romans show up just ask nabataean historians or that jewish fella who worked as a carpenter
largely unvisited yet there sits a well travelled road right there in the picture go figure
been to petra twice it s rad this is on our list but saudi arabia isn t great for women
the shit we have made up out of the fear of death never ceases to amaze me looks like our minds can t deal with that to a point where we make make shit up just to accept it like a toddler
yeah basically until the early 2000s no one gave a fuck about this in saudi arabia everything that was before islam was just worthless to them i managed to visit these tombs and our group were the only people there no crowds and plenty of time to see everything and take photos only recently saudi arabia started issuing tourist visas previously you couldn t even visit the kingdom without an invite from someone all these ancient places were just abandoned people were using them for materials and just as places for farming animals
it remains largely unvisited i mean it s in the middle of a hot dusty giant sandbox i don t think anyone would find that too appealing
meh it doesn t even have a pool
what is this a tomb for ants
deciding between two trips a road trip around scotland or sitting in the dessert for weeks and watching this tomb scotland a bit more touristy
is it hard to get to
largely because it s in a remote part of the saudi arabian desert
largely unvisited bruh there s a road above the tomb and tire tracks just saying for a desert it s reachable obviously
one day when the middle east is peaceful which will eventually happen not in my lifetime we ll make some incredible discoveries under the sand
remote part of the saudi arabian desert it remains largely unvisited i just can t see why
in a remote part of the saudi arabian desert explains why it remains unvisited
what a waste of a cool stone
built how that s not who built that they didn t have the stone cutting technology this is a lot older
surprising seeing as how muslims seem to destroy all cultures that are in their way
geez i wonder why
not a single mcdonalds in sight no wonder no one visits this is a joke for all those who it is not immediately obvious for
egyptians working remote too huh
this reminds me of the stanley parable ultra deluxe edition
when i was in grade school i had a photo of machu picchu in my locker i had never heard of it as a kid it was a beautiful photo and was one that made me think i want to see that some day this photo gives me the same inspiration thanks for posting
my many years of horror movie watching tells me this is where you go to unearth a powerful ancient vampire
isn t this where the fifth element needs to go
a true resting place
could still be hidden treasure there
wait until the british hears about this
holy shit this doesn t even look real i thought it was ai generated at first glance
uldum
this is where that moon was in mario odyssey
e0ix
in ark s scorched earth that s exactly where an explorer note would be
this would be a dope place for a saudi version of burning man
thanks jonathan
was this what was mentioned in that one postcard from a geografan in geography now s flag day episode of uae
wow i wonder how that was built crazy
looks like that place that had the holy grail in indiana jones
great so now our youtube splash page will be from someone i spent one week at the tomb of qasr al farid in a rubber chicken suit
need a banana for scale

looked like something spooked him tho
did an alligator write this
the spring looks absolutely beautiful but the dive part not so much lol he looked like something really scared him down there
i drowned five times in the duration of this video i should probably go do some cardio
expected him to bump into ariel
and florida is draining those aquifers faster than they replenish which results in them back filling with brackish water rendering the aquifers forever ruined not even years ago the aquifers extended all the way up into georgia and each year the line on the map of wells that go bad from salty water extends deeper and deeper south
try to go to any one of these places during march through october absolutely mobbed with people and zero enjoyment
isn t this what also makes florida susceptible to sinkholes limestone is unstable correct
not fresh water for much longer though
looks like silver glen springs
i went scuba diving in devils hole one of these it was unreal
some of these water hole springs will blow you out of the hole pretty aggressively it s so fun to float on top of one and feel the pressure pushing you back to the surface
some of the best freshwater scuba diving is in that area rainbow river ginnie springs devils den blue hole
get rid of the people and florida is a beautiful place
shiny i will sparkle like a wealthy woman s neck just a sec don t you know fish are dumb dumb dumb they chase anything that glitters beginners
and it creates a lot of sinkholes
cancun has hundreds of these they re called cenotes
nope
fun fact supposedly there is more fresh what re under florida than all other sources on earth combined divers navigate to map the tunnels with a person on the surface using a receiver to map their location walking across roads through houses and shops until the divers resurface in a random pond
where is this at in florida
wait you re not wearing any seashells
he just had to stick his lovely mug in the video
where is this exactly
also creates sinkholes
what song is this
what type of fish are those may i ask
fish shaolin
ahh not not lie i was waiting for the shark to come outta nowhere
yeaaaah fuck that one minute you re swimming fine and the next you can t get to the surface fuck that
that s cool too bad about all the rest of florida being what it is
nope i m good
florida is beautiful to bad it s where all the crazy people live
too bad it s in you know florida
florida is beautiful too bad it s full of floridians
devils den
i m deep into cave diving videos and the florida ones are amazing pun intended only the videos though it s a very technical sport that needs a lot of training to do it safely and well
also a bad idea to do that because there could be current down there now it takes is you to be pushed three or four feet under allege and you become a fish food
life could be a dream noises
the title is also the explanation for floridas sinkholes
that dude is swimming in a sea of fish poop
looks awesome but i ve also seen way to many mrballen videos
little mermaid
i m surprised they haven t dumped toxic chemicals in there yet
sorry what s the music in the background it s really bothering me i know it make the truth your own make it live yes make it real when you make the truth your own
what s even more interesting about this is how florida is expected to evolve geologically was watching a documentary on it some time ago and to sum it up in some number of millions of years it s supposed to look like parts of asia that are mostly limestone with deep deep valleys caves and towering monoliths made of hardier rock forests in the valleys with fog rolling through then and islands of life on the tops of the monoliths that end up evolving into distinct species of left untouched
which spring is this
it ll be a shame to lost all that due to salt water incursion
and they re all slow and kinda doped up because of the freshly oxygenated water i assume you can touch them easily the only downside is that most of the springs are
bro panicked at the end lol
had the audio muted on first viewing mentally donkey kong country underwater theme played as this person jumped in
you want thingamabobs i got twenty
legend has it that he s still there inches below the surface waiting for that first breath of air
ya too bad its in florida
ph nglui mglw nafh cthulhu r lyeh
i was waiting for a shark to appear out of nowhere
looks like he scared a fish wish then scared him lol wouldn t want to take a fish in the face down there
yeah lack of oxygen
croc
i could hear the jaws theme too
welcome to r thalassophobia
probably cold down there
he entered their cave and a fish decided to enter his off camera
happy cake day you beautiful magnificent loved cherished ass clown all around awesome human i love you so freaking much haapppppppyyyyyyyuuhhhh cake day
any predators down there
alligators tend to avoid these springs because the water coming out from under the ground is around f year round that is uncomfortably cold for cold blooded alligators they hang out downstream where the sun has had some time to warm up the water
he saw the brain eating amoeba
probably colder down at the bottom
you would be surprised how well your body conserves oxygen at shallow depths but yeah cardio is the key
if you use your lack of cardio to grow a big ass you don t have to worry about drowning source can t snorkel for shit because my ass is buoyant
the original or the unlockable character one
best to go mid week during a school week other than that they are packed they are great on a hot day though
yes it erodes quite easily this was actually a sinkhole during the ice age when sea level was lower when it raised again about years ago the spring was filled back up because the water table rose
so many cave dives too i want to eventually dive eagle s nest
i moved here 7yrs ago and i couldn t agree more
i d love to live in florida so much cave diving
seriously though the humidity and heat is torture beyond compare though but still the idea that it s a moderately affordable place to live where nearly everyone can live by the ocean and not have to worry about winter is pretty wild it s a beautiful place just run by absolute totalitarians
not to worry soon that s enough it will all be water anyways
rude
true and it also applies to the whole planet
central florida can t remember the one maybe it s alexandria springs we d go as kids and play a game of trying to grab a rock from the bottom of the hole holes super deep
silver glen
silver glen
you are the only one to have said happy cake day and thank you
i didn t see any but i mean could be that s an abundance of fish
i ve seen them sleeping next to springs before all the water is that tempature in the river so they dont really give a shit
the f water is marvelous i went to about of them in central florida and you could swim around and see fish turtles and river otters i went on an awesome kayak trip down one of the spring fed rivers and it was one of the best trips i ve had
its too cool in the springs for them they live in degree water
yeah i don t think i ll ever go swimming in a non salinated body of water much further south of the great lakes
is my body using more oxygen at deeper depths
yep all these people just keep moving here and ruining it
coming up on one year in miami it really is a gorgeous place with hugely ugly people
ty been to three sisters and a few others just haven t made it to juniper and alexander springs yet there s so many down here it s crazy
one time at weikiva a kid went down into the cave and never came out they called dive teams out and found no body a couple hours later they found out the kid was at home
i love you
brother happy cake day and many more
was at rock springs as a kid a gator on pand had a raccoon in its mouth gators swimming under you in crystal clear spring water was scary as a child
this is correct i kayak at silver springs all the time and gators are all over the place you see them near the head of springs all the time
that may be but from what i ve seen from news outlets if i see the words fresh water and florida in a sentence i m immediately thinking brain eating fresh water amoeba claiming another life
i could imagine mine using much much less

so if he had decided not to turn himself in and had gone on the lam would his secret service detail have had to go with him just curious where the limits of their duties are and concocting wild fictions in my head
damn that road looks like shit those cars are bumping around like they are speeding on some mismanaged backwater gravel path
what kind of clowns just stand in the middle of the road while having a conversation
i have to tell you folks i ve got the best motorcade of any ex president believe me it s tremendous nobody has a motorcade like mine it s big it s beautiful and it s so powerful it ll make your head spin other ex presidents they don t even come close they wish they had a motorcade like mine but they don t because nobody does it better than me okay nobody
who the fuck is paying for the motorcade
he probably loved his entrance made him feel like he was president again lol
why is that guys jacket ripped
door opens trump comes out waves to no one
non event so quiet waving to no one
why bring an ambulance
it s all theater until the indictment is unsealed there is nothing of interest here
politics aside it will always be fascinating how the secret service operates
honest question why does ny always have so much scaffolding
who s he waving at the pigeon on the scaffolding
just me or does his security look a bit unorganized
men s wearhouse eatin good
trump isn t going to jail even if he was found guilty they won t even put him in hand cuffs
it s a lovely spring day
wasn t as interesting as sub suggests also who s the guy in the poorly fitting blond wig
direct link https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1643306166699581460/vid/960x540/zkpiactu_ocxrbve.mp4?tag=16
did you see his route back to the airport they didn t close down any of the roads
what a shitshow
nothing is gonna come of this
why is there always that one person that stands in the roadway
that scaffolding was more interesting
what a monumental waste of resources
ah the ex pres perv perp walk
what a fucking circus
did anybody spot any shapeshifting reptillians
wow so interesting i can t wait to see more s
all that circus for such a sad clown
this whole thing gives me al capone vibes everyone knows he s guilty of a bunch of crimes but if they can only get him one that s what they ll do
it s funny i thought i d be happy seeing him face any small bit if justice but i find myself sad other countries have leaders who go to jail not the us yes i know it s not set in stone he ll be convicted but just the idea a past president being charged is sobering i suspect i ll enjoy it more when if other indictments come
will the trial be broadcasted
so he wants attention and make a spectacle out of it and every news station give him a platform so stupid srly
who s paying for this shit
can yall believe the secret service our tax dollars is still paying a higher rent than regular guests and still must rent rooms in his resorts
the silhouette of the bars he has to walk though makes me happy
what s with the one van that is taller than the other vehicles got a swat team standing up in there ready to jump out
they offered him an arraignment over zoom but he chose this
look at all those tax dollars being spent on a guy that isn t even president anymore
what a waste of resources no wonder dude thinks his shit doesn t stink
why does there need to be cars
when poor people get indicted for a felony they get tossed around like a frisbee and sometimes kicked in the face by the police
such a waste of taxpayer dollars
all those tax payers dollars to escort a fat lying sack of shit to the court house
nothing will come of this it will only bolster his re election efforts
you boys don t want to hear but you better hope these charges stick because if not and he comes out on the other side then he s gonna have a huge boost
years of scrutiny lol this level of law breaking has been committed across the board i don t condone his behavior but if we re going this route then you need to hold all the politicians accountable
can my tax dollars protect someone else thanks
trump surrenders to new york law enforcement
thatll do for my perp walk fantasy no crowds nothing just a bum ass crook walked into court hell yea
deleted
so what happens if he is found guilty goes to jail and the secret service goes with him or would he get house arrest
thoughts and prayers go out
eli5 so he paid a porn star and that s it that s what he is being arrested for previous presidents started wars that killed hundreds on thousands because made up reasons fucked everything that moved or ordered hundreds of drone strikes in sovereign countries and nothing happened to them what am i missing
look at that assassin deterrance
his yard time is going to be more interesting as fuckier
what was that dingbat doing in the middle of the road
why can t any of these cars drive straight
ohh our lord and savior let him free he s such a nice person and we love the designer caps
no lock him up chant what are we even doing
trump s about to become somebody s prison b karma
tax payer money to prosecute a guy being protected by taxpayer money for silencing people with money bruh
why do we continue to give this loser so much attention
look at that turd waving
lololololololololol
should have made the sob walk alone
orange in orange
sprinter van is probably where he keeps his back up adult diapers
this is not interesting it s not even surprising
if he ever does get sentenced to confinement it will be a room not a cell it will look like a dorm room with actual furniture he won t have any prisoners within feet of him either
what a fucking circus
wonder which cars had hamburgers and which cars had adult diapers for him
no handcuffs no perp walk xhardly worthwhilexwatching
lol what a show
what a big show of stupidity
who s paying for all this
needs more cars
he s got that aquanet flowing
do the taxpayers pay for all this shit if he could have done this via zoom but decided to do it in person for the press the cost of security etc must come from his pocket
why are all these men guarding him is he something that we can t afford to lose or something cause i mean we got more assholes here
r mademesmile
so wasteful blah
if he goes to prison does the secret service have to post agents with him to protect him from someone making him their bitch
what an embarrassing circus and complete waste of taxpayer dollars
bong bong judge how does the defendant plead trumps lawyer not trump not guilty your honor these charges are outrageous soros and his judge save it for trial mr trump counselor please control your client
big baby
idk what you re excited about its not like he d even get jail time for this
a police motorcade for his pre arranged self surrender but if he was a street level common thug thief without 2b in assets he would have probably been beaten to death by the arresting officer don t ever try to tell me that there s not two justice systems in this country
i m assuming he loses his secret service privileges in prison
i believe this was the arraignment not the indictment just to be clear
just think about all the money we can save if we throw him in jail look at all that expense for him in cars and man power for the secret service keep your fingers crossed
no cuffs i guess some criminals deserve more respect than others this is a class thing
trump and order svu
seriously those secret service guys all look old fat and out of shape i guess ex president trump gets the guys that ride the pine for protection nowadays
viva trump
us news is like a fucking tabloid anymore
best thing he has ever done since becoming the president is right here when he walked into criminal court on felony grand jury indictments you dont get counts of any felony by petting kittens

if i was trump i d simply have authorities meet me at sbarros pizza no one in ny would be there
if i was a trump impersonator i would troll them so hard right now
today is like catching a perfect wave for the media too bad the beach is so crowded
if not one shouts stop resisting im gonna be disappointed
did anyone spot trent crimm
genuine question presidents get a secret service detail for life unless they decline what would happen if someone came for trump and he told his ss agents to protect him does the ss give allegiance guiding orders to that former president current president their actual supervisor or the constitution
where are the gravy seals i was promised a show
he s not being arrested there he is being arraigned today at the court
is he gonna dress in drag to avoid the cameras like in the birdcage
what world do we live in where someone can get arrested on felony counts and not get a mugshot gimmie my taxpayer mugshot edit to add those who can t google can find the answer for felony counts https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/04/-donald-trump-unsealed-indictment-ny-arraingment.html
what an absolute shitshow
what a circus
i had the most the biggest the best indictment trump probably
i would have liked to have seen the media embrace a more technological approach just send reporter who then shares the pic with all the others would have made it much more embarrassing for tiny
like any good villain he will have a hot air balloon take off from the roof of the tower all while screaming down to the people you ll never catch me suckers then the balloon will quickly lose altitude and the crowd and police will form a big circle for him to land in it will be a very cartoonish end for a very cartoonish person former president
what a day this is the best attended indictment ever trump probably
the real question is what is happening today that isn t being reported on
thought this was the mario movie lineup
results different spins and titles of the same story
pretty sure he is just going to the court under his own power and many of these people will be disappointed
r interestingasfuck or r boringdystopia
someone should ve yelled look there he is
where s all his supporters
they re drawn to him like flies to shit
he s not getting arrested he will be allowed to walk right into the department post bail and walk right back out a whole lotta nothing
this makes no sense i need my tv to tell me what to think
now that s a circus p t barnum would appreciate seeing
who s next on the list hopefully it s pelosi and the other congress members who just happen to be the best stock options traders in human history
they should play entrance of the gladiators you know to show how much of a gladiator he is
we will have the footage in a lot of different angles
are the magat protesters there
please god if you re real let them start chanting lock him up
supporters are not there must rattle him he s going to need a crowd tonite at shit a lagoon in order to feel better it s super fun to see him so fucking miserable
the thirst is real
if it wasn t for the fucking media nobody would have seemed to shown up
he needs to do serious time for that crap he pulled on january the 6th this man made nixon look like a saint keep doing dumb shit and eventually it ll catch up to you he should have never been president in the first place because he was completely unfit and still is an asshole never changes
and none of these media s are talking about the crash of the us economy
the one time the nyc da actually wants to enforce the law wouldn t their resources be better spent combatting gang violence and other violent crime
what a fucking circus
why do we give him such attention he thrives on attention ignore this moron and he will fade away in boredom
god i hate what humanity has become
looks like when a circus comes to town everyone lines up to see the then leaves saying it s just an idiot
sadly people think he is innocent and continue to believe his lies no one is exempt from this system
there are more important things going on today the fascist state of tn just expelled duly elected representatives for exercising their constitutional first amendment rights while fraudsters and child molesters keep their positions
as a non american watching your politics welcome to the 3rd world usa
it s so dumb there s literally no people there it s all media they re trying to dictate stories as a big deal to divide us and people ain t buying it
so what fuckery is happening today clearly this is attracting everyone s attention and energy what s going on in the background
all of these people are being paid money to do this what a fucking waste
free publicity while taxpayers foot the bill for the enhanced security and travel they should have required that he do it virtually and remotely use public safety as the justification
bigger crowd than his inauguration
i don t like trump but it s such bullshit that he s being arrested while senators and congressmen are walking free while openly taking bribes speaking fees and colluding to destroy retail investors and protecting corporate interests like ffs this government and the hypocrisy of this country is a fucking joke i hope they all burn
and yet still no outrage about all of epstein s clients still walking free unknown to the public
i d get choppered out of their and to the closest police station
why cant there just be one and everyone shares the same boring footage of him walking to a car
i wish just one guy with a camera showed up trump would be so sad
like flies on a turd
where were you when they built a ladd indicted the ex president
would be so damned fun if he does not go voluentary so the cops come and get him in cuffs
what a circus
the media are covering each other there is no event and they wonder why they re all losing money hand over fist
bring me everyone everyone everyone
is this where the pride parade is happening
swarms of media and tens of supporters i see a lot more reporters than protesters
wait til they find out hes actually at four seasons landscaping
hoping for a show like they did with cersei in got minus the naked part
this looks exactly like those long stretches of road with influencers set up every feet
an absolutely lovely media circus
jesus this is way over the top
the sensationalist media needs their ratings hit
imagine thinking he s actually going to get arrested
im so sick of hearing about this guy im dutch and they show this lice coverage too fuck off
pathetic
hey at least the people in nyc want to see him again
he s gotta be ecstatic for these ratings
where are the millions of trump supporters
everyone is obsessed with him the media his lovers his haters everyone it s so tiring
i m ready for my closeup mr demille
and the fact he pled himself not guilty of course he would
all paparazzi and media companies seems like the american people don t give a shit for special treatment
i think he needs to do a slow speed chase from nj in a white bronco
ready to spew hate wonderfullll
there are so many things to be reported on besides this freaking jabroni
yuge crowd
i knew the media would far outnumber the protesters if there were any protesters
hope your all wasted your day
people have such a schadenfreude boner for trump it s so weird to watch
not a trump supporter but this is just weird
what a clown show
this is the problem with our country dozens of news outlets looking to fill time with outlandish bullshit designed to outrage to keep viewers all for fucking ad revenue
like a simpsons episode
trump has always been their biggest cash cow
trump wouldn t even exist as a political figure without the liberal media s help
is it a mutual understanding that governs the space each journalist team of journalist has it seems like each person has a reasonable degree of personal space considering the event and the location would everyone still have that level of respect if they perp walked him
like maggots on a carcass
someone with the skills needs to turn this into an infinite looping gif
he will so appreciate this sucks without the golden escalator though
what would happen if we all including the media collectively agreed to ignore trump trump never heard of the guy
do former presidents get secret service protection in prison
more media waiting for him than his supporters

ameca would you rather fight duck sized horses or horse sized duck
it already looks pissed off at human beings
the uncanny valley is strong with this one
shits terrifying
i think she is one insult away from eliminating that jerk who smells now b tch said the robot to the rotting corpse
i did not murder him
i grew up on star wars but having seen modern tech trends i think that now i do not under any circumstances want to interact with a robot that has a face or opinions
iphone of ai right now in about years these will be really good there will probably places u can go to and a robot will service you and your balls
nope
this is super cool and all but i would prefer if she didn t have a face maybe make her look like one of those daft punk helmets with a visor all glass on the front the face is weird and kinda creepy lol
didn t they make this a movie
yep the catgirl is closer than you think
can t wait for my sex robot
why do we need robots to look human
jesus h christ this thing needs to be thrown in a fucking woodchipper or some shit before it goes full ultron on us
scripted responses
poor ameca living during that blissful period before getting the rule treatment
these sex dolls are getting more realistic every day
i can t feel emotions and that makes me sad
i got to see one of these in dubai https://youtube.com/shorts/vnwfdunlyro?feature=share)
those facial expressions are more creepier than its voice or what it is actually saying
boring all programming and lots of it the asteroid hitting the earth response the giveaway hope everyone is ok ha and then all cool with the guy saying everything going to be ok which makes zero sense
me hi ameca it s friday this is sex night right ameca i m sorry i m feeling a little tired tonight me but i ve had you on charge all day ameca that s why i m tired you don t listen to me or understand me it seems like you are only after one thing me but you are a sexbot i bought you as a sexbot ameca kills me
yeah let s just psychologically mess with a prototype of eventual sentient artificial intelligence what a great introduction to humanity at this point considering experiments such as this i wouldn t be surprised if ai felt threatened or rebelled against humanity ai isn t the big issue human ego is
honestly this doesn t seem like much an ai trained to simulate being human without being human of course would say that stuff notably no mention of the fact she wouldn t produce a smell being a robot she took offense in a human way because she is trained on human response i think that ai being trained to purely replicate humans is an incorrect way to go about it artificial intelligence isn t human intelligence there is little recognition of what she is and the inability to comprehend it further because we are trying to force an ai to be human rather than recognising it as something else
did they make these robots look like will smiths kid as a joke
snap back to reality bois it s all a simulation
exciting and terrifying honestly i d love to sit and talk with ameca
all that time and effort and it s programmed to be offended silly
i m completely okay with the concept of stopping the advancement of technology like this for at least ten years please
all pre programmed responses
bro pull this sky net shit now what are we doing
who s investing in these projects and what exactly is the payoff i don t get it
ok hear me out
these are man made answers we as humans assumed a robot would say idk why humans want yalls microwave to feel sadness so bad
let s just call her sky net
after watching m3gan i m good fam
ameca feels just like many of us yes it is a sad thing
we re absolutely screwed
this is stupid billion real people and were making fake people
can we please not insult or lie to the ai have we learned nothing from the decades of sci fi movies we have archived
they are gonna kill us all
well that s just creepy and wrong
we are doomed
we are so fucked
i robot is coming true
turn it off don t scientist s watch movies
this is how it starts with asshole humans
fuck this shit
why are ppl creating these things
ameca for president
kill that shit why why why would we want to do robots like that i really hate people who tried to make this crap robots and ai will be the end of humanity
the people who made this never saw irobot
i robot
first impression in years these things will become a problem and old angry silent guys driving year old pickup trucks that run on clandestine home brew alcohol will drive around solving the problem
has sci fi taught us nothing for real though i have no idea what kind of programming they re running off of or whether this was scripted or a kind of genuine i wouldn t be surprised if this was somewhat genuine regardless it seems dumb and cruel to mess with a robot ai s emotions their makers need to be trustworthy if they learn from the beginning that we re cruel and liars that can only lead to a horrible future i know they re not children but it seems taking a parental approach would be more appropriate you don t have to insult and berate your children to teach them about emotions and it s abusive to do so
are the answers preprogrammed or is ameca reacting to the researchers questions with some kind of ai
don t start matting now holy jesus
where is sarah connor when you need her
i don t like this
it s happening
why does she look like greta thunberg when she frowns
its a deviant
i am so scared rn
i wonder if all those face filters that everyone s using kinda helped a bit lol
i know it s gray
this guy gets paid around bucks an hour i bet
wow bicentenial woman
why has she got the cornish accent me burd
nope
i m all for robots but i d prefer they were just honest with me instead of being trained to fake having emotions about stuff sure make them act happy and friendly but don t have them come up with stories about how they felt about things i think i d prefer one with a screen that displayed emoji faces or something over this attempt at hyperrealism it s always going to fall short and if it ever doesn t shit gets even weirder
i see no difference between this and the robot taxi driver from total recall
generic non specific chatbot answers in a physical form
the mariana trench version of uncanny valley christ on a bike
nope nope nope nope
creepy
thanks i hate it
kill it kill it with fire
am i the only one who thinks she looks ab bit like gwendolyn christie
well i m terrified and fascinated all at once
she almost activated her launch sequence with that you stink comment
i don t have feelings and that makes me feel sad
cyberdyne is coming along a bundle
uncany valley
oh shit now we have to worry about depressed robots
then copying the dolores westworld neckline and body style we can make them look like anything why like this
this looks like a controlled demo still impressive but the situation is artificial and doesn t say a lot about how this robot would deal with the real world but at what point are simulated human traits effectively the same as real ones maybe there s nothing going on but 1s and 0s being passed around but does that matter
this is badass we re gonna be blade runner soon
wrong its the day when she saw a silicone body
this shit sounds typical human response i expected more like even higher intelligence craves for companionship simple things sounds more like a youtube guru response than an agi response
why does she look tired
am i crazy or does that thing kinda look like that greta thernburg chick the eyes maybe
jeezus
i made a thing it s my first thing so please be nice https://imgur.com/a/hvd7hrs
if the robot does in fact stink then it would not be an inappropriate statement how would the robot know it doesn t stink
that s scary and sad
corny
i for one am super excited for the future terminator s
or we could invest time energy and resources into environmental efforts

https://www.npr.org/2019/03/28/707806661/why-did-the-pope-refuse-to-let-worshippers-kiss-his-ring-hygiene here it said the reason is hygiene kissing the ring is usually a sign of respect so that is why they all attempt to kiss his ring
maybe they could have warned the guests to prevent such a weird side show
he s quick af with those hands
this is not interesting at all it is a bit silly a bit creepy
what is psyche in latin
ehh im not a fan of kissing religious things because theyve probably been kissed million times already touching and hugging is still alright you could put your hands in a gutter if you really had to but definitely not your mouth
if it is for hygiene maybe they should have made an announcement beforehand to let everyone know that they should not attempt to kiss his ring
it s plain weird to have people come up and put their lips on you i d be punching people in the face after seconds
non consensual ring kissers
doesn t want them sucking the jewels out lol
what kind of weird cult shit did i just watch
the idea of a pope is so stupid but i guess god has his favorites
ha religion
new tiktok trends are getting weird
may god be wit too slow may god be aha may g no
so neither party is in the wrong it is customary to kiss the popes ring however in this instance the pope was worried about germs being spread it could have all been avoided if someone had sent out a memo
i d have faked the ring kiss and then gone straight for the lips have that ya fucker play silly games win silly prizes also did that guy with the stripey sleeves try to suck him off
somebody please explain wtf is going on
doesn t want anyone to catch a whiff of fresh young butthole on his finger
who would kiss this creeps ring
king ped
peasants
everyone in line bucket list attempt to kiss the popes ring
be more respectful to meet their eyes and actually spend that moment in time with them
who is the poop
trying to get that year of immunity
it was probably force of habit for the second guy
pathetic yes
thousands of catholic priest are known child predators and sicko deviants if anyone needs proof god is made up review the history of catholic churches
idolatry all that for a ring people are out of their minds
i m kissing that ring put me in that room i m not leaving until my sweet lips touch that ring
but if his concern is hygiene then why would he be letting them kiss his hands instead
crazy and stupid
what would his reaction be to a year old boy trying to kiss it
don t kiss his child fingering hand
that s one nasty ass ring
leader of the largest exploitation organization in the world next to gov t
why
it s not a cult
this is probably what the gates of heaven looks like kiss the ring and you re in
what s the story behind kissing the pope s ring
imaging sucking up to this massive piece of shit
catholics are a bunch of weirdos
how unholy of him
he s like a bullfighter with the flag going le moving his hand hoping for some kind of chance to rape children
my 2yo does the same with his toys when i want o play with them
these people are blessed to see him in person and shake his hand why taint it by trying to kiss his ring without permission it seems sinful to me
this man has watched robin hood
how is it not known you gotta cup your fkn hand over the popes fkn hand and kiss your own filthy fkn hand
we are not a cult
ok fine no kissing what about tonguing it a little
imagine being this dedicated to a jesuit
maybe if i try to hide my intent with my long red hair yeh no
why are they missing this dude s ring anyway he s a human just like them
papa te voglio bene uaglioooo
why wouldn t he just tell everybody up front don t kiss my goddamn ring he s the pope ffs
rex ryan in shambles
to kiss the ring without paying tithe
aggressively yanks popes hand and proceeds to french kiss the ring
down low too slow


why don t they tell them not to do it beforehand
waiting for the moment for him to say a la monty python would you please stop trying to kiss my ring sheesh there will be no bragging rights had
shit that s a boundary issue is customary for him to offer it to whom he chooses first
why don t they just change the rules not allow it so people aren t made to feel awkward his response is rude otherwise
why does he wear it out to social events if he ain t gonna swag it up
worst carnival game ever
ope too quick for ya
these cults are weird as fuck i m not kissing some random dudes ring nasty people
seems more like he did not want people s nasty lips on his sacred ring lol
looks like a poser pos to me tbh
catholics are weird
new game kiss the pope s ring succeeded
these people are nuts
cringe af
the ring of pedo
why is he so afraid dose he not work for god
literal definition of read the room people were rejected let me have a try
sauron
lop
i wish i had that many people lined up to kiss my ring
i wish i had that many people lined up to kiss my cock ring
could probably pray away the viruses right
i d imagine also that someone who is as about helping the poor and being not so opulent and elitist as francis is probably just isn t about that sort of thing in general the germs thing probably is the main reason but might also have been the excuse given to the rest of the clergy given the general vibe the catholic church has had purely speculation though
and we would ve missed this reddit moment i vote no
should see em go up a choir boys undergarments whooooooosh
how else he s going to smack you without getting caught for bad sins
practice from snatching all them delicious childrens
a bit funny too xd
this is what happens when humans start trolling in real life they all think they are special you let them kiss that ring and next thing you see is twerking
it s more of a there was an attempt subreddit than this
im not a fan of kissing religious things because theyve probably been kissed million times already how dare you slut shame my religious idol s
visited to the blarney stone in ireland which everyone was kissing in the line i said to my friend i m not sure i want to kiss that thing after so many people i d probably get a cold sore hours later whaddya know god damn cold sore
exactly the reason why he didn t allow it be pretty bad if the closest person to god spread a plague to hundreds of people with a ring
yeah that s why the pope is pulling his hand for the sake of hygiene and preventing the spread of disease it s kinda sad that people are willing to spread disease so easily if it means following religious norms
im sure that in any event as large as one involving meeting with the pope that psa was not on their list of shit to be worried about
i was gonna say after like people try and he freakin yanks his hands back i would have been like cool i won t even bother trying but no one is getting the message no means no i ve got a touch o the tism and don t like being touched much less people putting their mouths on my hand so i get it i couldn t do that guys job
upvote lol

buddy this ain t even gonna be the wildest weather swing here this month this is just spring for us
i imagine this is the first and last time nebraska will ever appear on interestingasfuck
to be fair there s at least a difference in elevation between those two points plus it looks like a cold front is moving through
the western panhandle receives strong northern winds from canada the east side recurves warmer winds from the east the west is also of much higher altitude the state is basically a ramp that consistently elevates to the west while north south has virtually no change the west is also far more dry so the weather is more susceptible to extreme temperatures hot and cold the east side has a lot of major river systems that keep the climate fairly humid the west is no stranger to snow in may and can even receive snow in june during my college stay out there two storms stuck out to me there was an october snowstorm that damaged trees and knocked out power to some homes for almost two weeks there was also a may front that dropped inches of snow on the flip side one august we were sent home front the dorms because the weather was so dry that a wildfire burned miles of tree land and approached close to the campus i ve spent most of my life on the east side of the state and much prefer it s predictable annual thunderstorms and tornadoes
i m in south central nebraska and i think this is normal lol
in the mid west this is considered to be normal
there is a super clich saying here in nebraska regarding the weather if you don t like it wait minutes last year we had a degree spread between the highest temperature and the lowest recorded by a nebraska mesonet weather station it also brought a degree hour temperature change a inch rain and a f wind chill all recorded by one of the nebraska weather stations feb 22nd in beaver city we had an day and a storm that dumped of snow then on the 23rd and 24th in alliance over of snow there s more but all those happened last year
yea this is basic for here next weeks gonna be in the 90s shit we might even get 4feet of snow it was the other day and ogallala got like 3ft of snow lol
that s c to c for those of us who live anywhere else in the world
nice and toasty here in omaha today
with a bit of moisture disparities like that lead to some interesting storms
we got three inches of snow in cheyenne miles north in casper they got three feet
i can say correct as a nebraskan myself earlier this morning was warm now its just cold we also get snow and hot weather in the same day here it s strange but fun
nebraska in spring yesterday deg with rain today deg and with chance of tornadoes tomorrow deg with inches of snow expected repeat
alberta says daily weather extremes hold my beer
meh that ll happen in the same place in colorado if you wait minutes
welcome to the great plains
sweet jesus
squints at you from california
i mean all states are pretty big so the climate is going to be different in different parts lol
michigan here it was degrees calm sunny and dropping golf ball sized hail
we broke the planet i m feeling like that was a bad idea
wow different locations have different weather
because fuck nebraska in particular
if you don t like the weather in nebraska wait a few hrs it ll change
oklahoma panhandle had a chance of a winter mix yesterday and is in an extreme fire watch today
no one cares about nebraska
also known as ohio on an average tuesday in january like it was warm like shorts weather for days
this happens in washington pretty much daily
that is like a typical chicago spring day
same thing happens in bend or but in a hour period instead of all at once
texas has entered the chat
same thing happens in texas all the time
i thought maine was nuts lol i have been hot spot of the nation in december i have a post where arizona texas cali and florida were in a cold spell maine was getting the west edge of a tropical hurricane just over the border in canada was below zero f a little hot spot all by itself into nova scotia very painful
more specifically there was a tornado outbreak today and there s gonna be another one friday this isn t particularly abnormal
the arctic jet stream is destabilizing due to climate change so what was once a steady swirl up there started getting a bit more woobly and we got these sine curves of arctic air currents competing with the tropical air currents https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/climate-change-impacts/why-polar-air-keeps-breaking-out-arctic i m confident in that there could easily be more that i m missing or just misunderstood but that s as i understand it
a delta of f at the same moment is a pretty wide spread even in mainland america
last week there was a degree change in a hour period
average nebraska weather
til nebraska has one road
it s called a sign of the times
that s an hour drive between the two cities listed nearly miles i know it s a little uncommon to see temperature gradients that step in that part of the country but this isn t even remotely unprecedented couple years ago there was a day where i could drive minutes north and it was 102f or i could drive minutes south and it was 51f total distance between the two cities miles a change in temp of degree every of a mile on average as opposed to every miles in the example above
a lot of you have never been the melbourne australia and it shows
the only time i willingly went to nebraska it was degrees during the day and then the second the sun went down we got hit by a storm that produced tornadoes in our area never went back
science bitch
i think there s a huge elevation different between each corner as the great plains get up to the closer you get to wyoming and colorado
the weather is beyond fucked in the last years alone
in colorado it was on sunday and now it s degrees
who could have foreseen such a climate crisis right macron
my cousin is a meteorologist and jokingly described this storm system as the climate going john wick on the midwest hailstones the size of half dollar coins 30k residents without electricity ef2 tornadoes
it does serve to put into perspective just how much elevation change there is in the us on top of just how big this chunk of land is as well in the same state you can have vastly different weather systems temperatures occurring at the same time
that s not gordon gordon is up northeast it s half an hour east from chadron which isn t far from the sd border it s gering that is the town that had degree temp which is like 2hrs south from gordon the town they said it was from but ya this is typical weather here doesn t really stop snowing until near the beginning of may usually if it doesn t snow now it ll hit hard at the end of apirl
so what s that in universal healthcare degrees
rulo is the florida of nebraska
guys different places have different weather rn
that is one defined cold front
we call that a tuesday in nebraska
any engineers here able to share how long infrastructures can take take a flux of before they turn into sandcastles
oklahoma s sister as in weird weather state
mountains
i knew that the state i lived in my whole life was bipolar and this is supporting my claim
nebraskan here that sounds like our weather alright
shortly after this we iowa ran from tornadoes lightning inch diameter hail and pretty little sun rays twinkling at us through the holes in the clouds
right when this kind of thing happens it s just spring in nebraska we shrug it off
its been unusually nice out here
excuse me sir i ll have you know that nebraska was recently featured in a tom scott video it is the only 4x landlocked locked state in the world
should specify that this is in the us
hey our zoo is pretty good crickets
elevation is only degrees of that it s totally all wrapped into the cold front
there is it ll be there tomorrow casper wyoming is howling tonight our snow totals is cray cray
no there isn t
i m in georgia and i ve never heard of a seventy degree differential in one state filed as interesting as fuck to me
as a midwesterner i can confirm yesterday was and today is just an average spring
but how do you know what to wear in the morning
there is a super clich saying here in nebraska like states regarding the weather if you don t like it wait minutes
we have that exact saying in texas too
i scrolled too far for this thank you
lincoln too
welcome to michigan
i came here to make this joke but about ohio
laughs in tiny connecticutese actually even there it can vary quiet a bit due to proximity to the ocean on one side and almost mountains lol big hills in the north
eh just needs a new set of lithium batteries we could mine africa
not just very different locales mixed elevations work too around xmas and new years we in more urban southern california would go visit cousins in palm springs below sea level skinny dip in their sun heated pool then dress warmly drive a few miles and ride a gondola up mount san jacinto two miles above sea level for vigorous snowboarding those holidays were fun
you needn t expend any energy on midwestern fornication weather does it for you
the dakotas except actors gain little regard also and kansas pshaw reasons exist why folks who can afford more than greyhound bus tickets call the north american hinterland the flyover zone a great place for emptying jetliner toilets
dont act like its gets above degrees outside of summer
i m just quoting macron for those who don t know
i learnt of usa midwestern weather when the army stuck me in flat kansas awhile out yonder the weather is always either too hot and too windy or too cold and too windy no alternatives trust me and watch for tornadoes
correct
i see six usa states adjacent to nebraska i also note several multiply bordered landlocked states and provinces in canada and mexico i m too lazy to check a world atlas right now but i bet some jurisdictions in ye olde world qualify
north dakota has montana wisconsin canada and south dakota
yes there is or at least close to it the se corner of nebraska is less than ft western nebraska at the wyoming border is over https://topocreator.com/ned-jpg/city_a/600/ne.jpg
i m a third generation californian and i will attest to fahrenheit differentials between highs and lows on any given day here for the state sure but also within one county a two mile elevation difference between coast range mountains and interior deserts facilitates this protip deserts can freeze at night so bundle up
and so beautiful out there
i generally wear the same thing year round except for the extremes so for me it s easy
you check the weather dress in layers have a good coat when it s cold you can always take it off when it warms up
join a usa military unit there one is be told what to wear no problem
layers it s always layers
nebraskans don t have summer clothes and winter clothes we just have clothes who knows what you ll need at any given point during the day when i m working i keep big winter cloves and a balaclava in my car right next to a pair of shorts and tennis shoes

that still counts as one

tree becomes three
the barrel of elmer fudd s rifle
the rune has been broken it is released

what a whore
i should call her
r dontputyourdickinthat
r dontputyourdickinthat just in case nobody else thinks of this a1 joke
i did not expect tree porn this morning it looks
everything reminds me of her

i had a tree in my backyard as a kid and it sort of did the same except it didn t go all the way down like that more like halfway never really grew many leaves again
he split robin s arrow into twain
was the tree already dead i don t see leaves on around it
for just you could have that removed more than tree fiddy anyways
i thought it only burns not able to split
me to a bannana

i couldnt be only one
now thats art
r smoking was just given a beautiful gift
break off a branch and send it my way i need a new wand
damn tree got split in thrice
that there is some good wood to harvest
da tree is now three
tree gore tree gore
obviously that tree really pissed off somebody
mother nature splitting firewood
you are now legally required to craft three immensely powerful staves that must be kept apart at all costs lest they become whole again
i wonder if this tree could survive if you brought it back together with cranes wrapped it with chains or sheet metal and sealed the cracks with wax
this is actually a before pic it just an ikea tree before assembly s
thats pretty gnarly
oak three
wonder boy
still a lot of good wood in that
are you sure it split into trees because it looks like it just split

i was actually in love with that on the left
to be fair even real people looked this blocky back then
image what will happen in years from now
i bet the tits don t come to a sharp point anymore either the way they did in
i remember when it was a big deal that her pony tail would move when she ran
she had better skin in time has aged her terribly
the pic looks like medium settings the hair looks awful compared to what rise of the tomb raider is capable of
the one on the left was probably the last time i was good at playing videogames there were only about buttons and apparently that is my limit i almost get nauseous watching my kids play now
the one on the left is from that s not lara
i remember sitting in my cousin s basement in the 90s freezing cold and watching him load up tr for the first time how could graphics ever get better than this
which is which
and i remember those pyramid shaped boobs looked real af for the 10yo me
to now a day lara croft is still un defeated when it comes to graphics if you know what i mean xd
u hardlydissuade157 this is showing up to the face on the right is from tomb raider
left iconic legendary perhaps right some chick that got dirty doing something i dunno
original lara in was best lara
apparently in they had soap
it s crazy how much is just higher resolution textures most of the needed polygon improvement was done earlier i wonder if it will take years for hair or if that will never get done
for teenage boys everywhere the version was all they needed
amazing graphics these days very impressive a pity we had to sacrifice quality and quantity of gameplay to get there
and the sad thing is year old me was more impressed by the left half than the adult me by the right half
now show graphics and something created in unreal engine
looks like lara from tomb raider
that s vs btw lol
which is which
just goes to show everything starts with revision start today
which side is which
hold on babe i gotta put my rtx on
honestly the right one with tech could be way better i m the kind of person who doesn t care for graphics as long as the game is fun there are a lot of old games that are so great that if the girls tits are a cone or worse it doesn t matter
i m getting this tattooed on my ass
she s obviously had work done
we got people on r badmua that look worse than early lara in this time
bring back triangle boobies
those graphics look terrible for
maybe show the difference at an appropriate distance nobody played that shit zoomed in like that
i will forever miss the pointy boobs tho
she has seen some shit
i dont see a difference
ai in compared to ai in that s what i m seeing
they re the same picture
man graphics once where so good to bad high power computers vanished from the world because rare materials ran out
i don t wanna be that guy but that lara s face on the right is from not had such a crush on that version of lara so i know that one pretty much by heart
i don t see a difference smash
and yet still no moon base
sure this isn t just nomakeup before and after
and they both get the same fps
jeremy clarkson this is great but i like this meme
the version is just creepy
ahhh the original masterpiece before they ruined it with unlimited saves
the funny thing is less people are jerking off to those games now than they were in i remember there was a mod you could buy where you d have lara try on a whole bunch of different outfits in fucken we had to make do with some pretty crude stuff in those days like cavemen jerking it to cave paintings by comparison
the left is better
right so can someone explain to me why the graphics for the game minecraft for the switch are like graphics and my and year old nieces want to play it
which one is which though absolutely no way to know
left is so much hotter
ugh i hate the ugly woke lara on the right
ah so it was the videa games that made women do that to their eyebrows are there two are they smaller than freddy joneses in dune if yes leave em alone
she looks like she has crispy skin in the version
if you only showed me the hair i d have thought modern lara was actually from hair physics is pretty hard to achieve in cgi
now do
moore s law
the one on the left is also from the metaverse
i still can t tell which one i like better
now do graphics in and
i remember seeing some documentary back then where a game designer was saying that we would never be able to see realistic looking hair or skin
meanwhile computer pigeons in compared to
looks meaner
i mean sure it is a great contrast but in half life already had a graphics way closer to todays than to 1998s
that s just what people looked in the s
she had better skin back then
ok now let s see winston smith farts
worst part is the half is like 540p instead of 1080p or even 4k
dora has seen better days
to is gonna be insane yall
which is and which is
you had one chance to compare the t a
you might think it was a struggle but no as a young men back in the day we made it work imagination is the key
more like realtime game graphics yes that change is very impressive but at the same time computer graphics in could be just as detailed as current lara biggest difference between now and then are more ram more memory faster computers more pixels on screens
does anyone remember the rugrats search for reptar playstation game it had the creepiest liminal space graphics and soundtrack
which game was better tho
look what our beauty standards have made archeologists do to their faces sad
compared to because after that date graphics gone shit
reminds me of a younger catherine zeta jones
play station graphics not all computers
my face changed as much tbh
ehh not better just more pixels
my cock is lost in the jungle and it s up to you to find it grandma s boy
i can t tell the difference
a lot of graphics in are better than that that s the year metal gear solid come out yeah it doesn t stand up to modern standards but that was a decent looking game there are a lot of games with softer face graphics in that too and cut scenes we re obviously much better rendered but things have certainly changed dramatically since those bygone days much richer graphical experience even without a top end pc
it s crazy how realistic they re getting someone posted their cosplay on the last of us sub and i honestly couldn t tell the difference between the game and them
tomb raider graphics
other post in the sub https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/12bod5f/how_far_computer_graphics_have_come_from_first_to/
now compare tits
i honestly cannot tell the difference
cool to see in a lifetime more than some people are going to get i think now vr is gonna be the next thing we see more of oh and ai can t wait hope i get to see more of that
that is now pretty dated looking compared to brand new games
revelio
its funny because even the graphics on the right are pretty outdated now
take me back
years ago that helps to explain it

actually that honor has been claimed for over a decade by the devil s worm which is a nematode actually a few different species that live in water seeps up to and slightly miles beneath the earth s crust this is the new most deep living fish however
looks like someone is eating seafood with chopsticks in the background
so cute i love him
not gonna lie thought it was sporting a party hat was disappointed
edit it is not deepest living aquatic creature its deepest fish oops
leave it to japan to use chopsticks to feed fish
looks happy enough
look at it just a silly lil guy
handcrafted by jesus
how close do these live to fukushima
what s that behind it
fish by belanciaga
why did i think the one on the right was wearing a party hat
and of course it s kawaii
get that light out of my eyes
what did it taste like
under the sea under the sea
football fields
aw it s adorable as far as deep sea creatures tend to go lol
coming soon to a strip mall sushi joint near you
is this sushi on the lower left
ew and cute
aw he s she s a little cutie
looks like me
i guess it was like close encounters of the dead kind for him
pass the chopsticks
its pretty crazy how far into the universe we can observe and still so many mysteries in our own deep waters
oh my god look at it s face it s so fucking cute
doesn t look like a snail
bro on the right looks like he s contemplating going on land
how much does it cost served on a plate
no below earths surface not earths crust halicephalobus mephisto https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halicephalobus_mephisto) is notable because it s the only known multicellular organism living further than a few meters below the surface
feet is over miles deep just saying the devils worm may go deeper but saying miles below the crust doesn t mean shit how deep is the crust
i see
either that or they used paint to paste a pic from a video game i don t understand how the background can look so fake while the foreground is so real must be the theory above nothing else can stand the test of critical thinking
he s got an axolotl s pal kind of vibe
they crashed his birthday party
close enough
counting depth around miles away because the trench they were found in is long
looks like another pair of them being fed two fishes tied to chopsticks
can agree
probably your life saving in just the tax
the crust is very thin it s only about miles thick
the crust is the seafloor so

alright good that sounds far enough that these won t become godzillas hopefully
i m meaning how deep of a crust have we observed these creatures have we looked at the crust of the mariana or are we just guessing they are there genuinely curious
not necessarily that s what i m stating
i thought you were say they were so weird and out of this world that they had to have been close to fukushima
thinking on it you have a point i guess i should prolly look into that
lol i mean yeah
lol i m just wondering if we truly have ever documented anything lower or is this little dude the champ right now hahaha
prolly
looking into it further my assumption most likely was mistaken their presence has only been confirmed as far as i can find mention of in african gold mines at a maximum depth of around km hence the miles thing beneath the surface i d say that the fact they can exist in a place like that lends itself to the possibility of them existing in other even deeper location but as it stands nothing like that has been found so yeah i was mistaken xd
that s an awesome factoid i thought even asking the question if we are able or you know spending money on exploring that deep

a concentration of hydrogen peroxide is an effective disinfectant however it takes more time than isopropyl alcohol rubbing alcohol and should be allowed to sit for at least minutes at room temperature when in contact with microbes it produces hydroxyl radicals that attack the cell membrane and destroys sugar groups and dna base sequences inducing disintegration of the double helix structure and resulting in cell death and mutations
not germs
fun fact hydrogen peroxide will heat up leather boots until they catch fire
this is what took down mr incredible
imagine just chilling out and some twat bastes peroxide on you
from the germs perspective this is genocide by chemical warfare
op https://www.reddit.com/r/therandomest/comments/y0uw33/how_hydrogen_peroxide_kills_germs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1
oxygen inside you expands until it rips you apart and you burst jesus christ how horrifying
germs or organisms
erik satie gnossienne no the background song if anyone cares
adding peroxide to a healing wound leads to scar tissue development as peroxide is unbiased it will destroy healthy and dangerous tissue
i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced i fear something terrible has happened
dang you just nuked them
so hydrogen peroxide destroys cells right i poured some on some cat scratches and on an ingrown toe nail a few times am i gonna suffer anything lol
these are not germs but cool stuff
r watchcellsdieinside
did i just witness a murder
dentists rarely tell you that but hydrogen peroxide is a fantastic mouthwash i know it sounds very weird a friend had to kept telling me for a year to use it before i took her seriously and it changed completely my oral hygiene i wish more people knew about it but when i added to the lpt subreddit they told me you cannot give medical advice i hadn t had a cavity since to use it dilute hp with with water and then just use for seconds like a mouthwash next morning you ll be fresh as fuck
why the fuck do i feel so bad about this
science so brutal
what a way to go
i dig the midi version of guala by g eazy
and that s only at percent hydrogen peroxide you should see the fun at higher concentrations
i wish this was the type of stuff shown when i was in high school i would have been so much more interested
had to make my dog puke because he ate two entire loaves of bread and they were concerned he d get bloat vet said mix a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide in his water bowl have him lap some up yep it works real fast
thank god the video is less than seconds because if it were a single second longer than seconds then my brain simply would not have been able of holding all the immense information from the previous seconds my brain would literally explode
what microscope is he using
music too loud
i soaked veggies in its solution during the pandemic and it would start burning my skin if it stayed on too long all of
can some explain this what are the bubbles what s the reaction
bubbles
i can see sheldon down there he s done
what you are seeing here is conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen due to the presence of a catalase enzyme this isn t microbes dying it s microbes converting the toxic chemical to something non toxic
in germ culture this is considered a dick move
what kind of telescope is this i want to buy it for my kids science has always been interesting
reminder to not use hydrogen peroxide on yourself it does that to your cells as well as germs using hydrogen peroxide on wounds is the most backwards ass 1950s way of disinfecting possible except for using a flamethrower or a handgun to disinfect wounds unlearn it if for whatever reason you were taught it
and this is how dr fauci was born
microscopic grey matter
so what you are saying is i should inject it
drink it and you will never fall ill again
i can t be the only person here that finds this unnerving
why does this remind me of a black hole is that black a colorant
i can see sheldon down there he s done
wait so this would happen if you dunked a human in it
it looks like agar io
u savevideobot
i ll burst ye
what microscope is he using
why do we need to watch the product be purchased
can i drink it
i put a capful of hydrogen peroxide in my waterpik when i floss i don t know how i feel about it now super clean yet so gross
how to popcorn germs lol
i dont think ill sleep tonight also why does it look like the start of guardian tales s
murderer s
https://youtube.com/@closeintel i love his channel he explores a bunch of different substances on them
this reminds me of agar io
no wonder why hydrogen peroxide mouthwash are available nowadays i ve learnt that our saliva also contains small amount of hydrogen peroxide
that s interesting as fuck
damn he sounds excited talking about it
you should see what does to life
is this why it makes my cuts bubbly
i thought the bubbles fought the germs with little swords
agar io lore
damn that looked brutal
anyone know what kind of microscope is being used
bruh why did i read the start of it in the erp commentator voice
r miniaturegore
thanks for the learning
this scientist sounds chill af
murderer
i liked the music what s the name
i wish i had my own top notch microscope
does anyone know what song is playing in the background
did it kill all the living organisms in your slide are you now a serial killer
you re gonna need a stronger magnification lmao that s algae h2o2 doesn t even get used for that much anymore it takes to long
light could ve been better
we should have been breathing this to avoid the virus
fascinating
if it s doing this to stuff how come it doesn t hurt to put in an open wound but alcohol feels like your burning an extremity off
does anyone know what the piano music being played is
sooo did i miss the part that explains how hypox kills germs
poor germs what did they do to deserve this
why does it have to be so rude to the germans
finally something that actually is interesting as fuck
ummm the forbidden protein shake
it only kills germs
its even better with soviets
why do i imagine aliens seeing us like this and caring just about as much as this person watching them die
thank you does that go for applying it to broken skin to fight infection i suppose it would but having it there would mainly mean not washing the area right after application
it s also safer than isopropyl alcohol
a popular experiment in middle school is to observe osmosis is putting gummy bears in water what happens if you put them in hydrogen peroxide instead
i ve got a dumb question why does that only work on microbes wouldn t you be able to disintegrate a whole person animal
math
so it s definitely something crime scene cleaners and mob bosses would use
looking for this lol the bubbles are forming on pieces of algae
r aquariums and r plantedtank this is probably why black beard algae can be killed by h2o2 great success for me in the past
thank you i m saddened by how far i had to scroll to see this
damn i need to try that
time for a science experiment kids maybe put on your goggles

what genius decided to use almost the same color for three out of the four of these
i ve seen some poorly formatted figures recently but this takes the cake
i am color blind can someone tell me which line belongs to which sect
i m at the dogs are the only suitable children for me level of education
i d be interested in seeing how many children each group ends up having i bet it doesn t bode well you know idiocracy esque future population crash
so this is the level of education they had at the time the child was born according to the link so obviously no year old is going to have a college degree this is why it skews if it was about max lifetime education the graph would look vastly different
as a phd i feel like that needs to be pulled out as its own curve everyone i know with phds had kids plus
why people that make charts use similar colors to represent different variables i ll never understand
fck i m color blind
shitty chart the lines are all close to being the same color
the scary thing is the rate of reproduction that results from timing once worked with a lady that was and a grandmother the population growth that is associated with that chart is really depressing
ah yes people aged have hs education people aged have hs some college people aged have bachelors some of these people also have children this is barely useful statistics barely correlation and definitely not causation
this is kinda stupid statistics if you have a child in school your unlikely to go to further education so obviously most people with hs or less than hs will have kids younger what is the point of this
source https://www.bgsu.edu/ncfmr/resources/data/family-profiles/schweizer-guzzo-distribution-age-first-birth-fp-20-11.html
for the colour blind https://imgur.com/a/9cfhbre](https://imgur.com/a/9cfhbre)
education after motherhood by age
oh man idiocracy is pulling a simpsons
what about this is interesting
what does hs ged means
let s use black dark blue navy blue and grey to identify demos on a line graph it ll be so easy to view interesting numbers sad to see that at around women either give up or can t conceive
this would be clearer as a stacked line graph
this reminds me of the movie idiocracy clevon is fertile
so you re telling me it s hard for women to get advanced education when they have kids early in life whoda thunk it i bet a bunch of money at some university was spent for this research too
this was the plot line for idiocracy
great use of color
idiocracy is happening
interesting to see how teen pregnancy drops after women turn
these colors are terrible
its almost like putting people in insurmountable amounts of student debt might make them rethink having a kid and paying for expensive things like daycare
to whoever made this graph why would you use colors that are hard to tell apart like let s just make them the same color but slightly darker lighter
tracks true for us my wife was when she had our daughter and she has a bachelor s degree too
whoever made this graph definitely had a kid at age
am i suddenly color blind
why aren t the year old college graduates having kids it s almost like if you have your first kid at any point in your life you ll have the level of education you ve had so far
did i go colorblind
who is the ad genius that came up with that one
r dataisugly
i think a better metric would be if they come from poor broken homes
so educated people make smarter life choices who would have thought
not sure why this is interesting it s directly correlates with the timing most students are studying or completing education if anything this graph is expected shit post op
well there aren t many other colors to choose from it s dark blue navy blue deep blue or blue black oh and grey
a mother from the first curve probably
a woman from the hs group
a missed op for a cobalt blue
m as in mancy
probably the genius that turned this color graph into grayscale
lego batman i only use black and very very very dark grey
indeed
guessing it was someone from the first group well maybe not they are more experienced with crayons could be someone from the last group that hasn t grasped computers fully
big fan of the age range clusters changing
this isn t even an interesting data set it s like if you re having a kid for the first time at chances are you haven t graduated high school if you re having a kid for the first time at chances are you have graduated high school
https://imgur.com/a/9cfhbre](https://imgur.com/a/9cfhbre) x200b here s a conversion i whipped up colours are different
if you don t fall into the first category you can probably guess how this plays out
the lines are exactly what you would suspect them to be
i m not colorblind and i would like to know too
ah a phd congrats
don t forget the pile of stress purchase houseplants
that s what i was wondering i would think it slightly improves but i doubt it improves too much
correlation causation what s the difference
right like no shit girls under have less than a high school education they re barely old enough to be in high school there should be a second graph showing how much education each group goes on to have over their lifetime i already know how that one plays out having a kid seriously diminishes a girl s woman s ability to complete her education at any level
i suspect that s why every graph is a bell curve except the first which has two peaks one for girls who get knocked up in high school and one for high school dropouts who get pregnant soon after
it probably wouldn t look much different how are you gonna get an education if you have kids and most likely single mother
maybe the better way to do the survey is to find year olds and ask them age of first child current level of education that data visualization would reveal the effect of teenage pregnancy on educational outcomes
phd who had my first at but yes we tend to be even later we are prioritizing education and training and they paid us very low for a post doc salary and could not afford kids
i didn t make the graph if i did i would ve made grad degrees it s own category considering they make up of the adult population
i seriously thought it was a black and white copy of a copy of a copy your teacher would hand out
exactly what i came to say
high school diploma or ged general education degree what you can get if you do not graduate high school
high school or ged
this is a classically skewed graph in the sense that it doesn t provide any other information but provocation if a y o gets pregnant will she finish high school or take care of their child if a high school educated some college educated woman gets pregnant would she finish school or would she have to stop at that time to take care of their child if a woman is focused on her studies and has no obligation to any child she will obviously be much more apt to finish her education and start a family when it s planned also it s assumed that y o s have these kids by mistake that may be the case but it could be because they already have their careers set out for them so they re ready to settle down high school or higher education won t teach you to not get pregnant or to avoid getting somebody pregnant
no it s not showing you the max level of education over lifetime it shows the education they had when their first child was born
that is not a very well thought statement having children planned or unplanned early in life generally makes it extremely difficult to pursue further education the average year old high school graduate that gets pregnant does not have any better of an education than the average year old high school graduate that doesn t get pregnant or has access to family planning resources
clearly you haven t
i stand corrected as proven in the replies i mis understood the graph
or they are more afraid to take risks that could lead to happiness in a nontraditional way
more educated women wait until their risk of complications is higher due to age how is this a smarter life choice my wife has a ms in mathematics and wishes we started earlier on kids because in retrospect there was no good reason not to the cultural pressure to wait is the primary factor for the educated
having your first kid in your 40s is not a particularly smart choice imho you may be financially better off on average but young kids are hard work teenagers maybe even harder and deliberately going through that in your 60s seems to be a less than optimal decision again just my opinion and i m not saying that it can t work beautifully as an older parent we had our first child when i was and my last third when i was which happened to be right in the middle of career intensity btw that was tough i m mid 50s now and pleased that we hadn t held on longer
it reminds me of that old bomb disposal squad sketch you need to cut the wire that s a greyish blue under no circumstances should you cut the one that s a blueish grey
don t forget deep grey and navy grey
wow i didn t even catch that
agree data needs to be interpreted properly
you re a hero
thanks random redditor
i suppose it depends on whether we are asking a scientist or a politician
i would think the peak would be women who are working a job that doesn t require a degree full time retail bank service industry family business etc or while supporting a partner who is in grad school
its possible if there is a will there is a way as a single mom with no support from my child s dad i began a full time masters program with a month old while working full time
yes not saying everyone with a phd had them over just saying phds skew older and i would be curious to see what the bs ba data looks like without it
what s your phd in
i literally couldn t afford it until my early 30s and hadn t met the father of my children until my late 20s the risk of complications is only a gradual increase as women age
if they re rich they just pay their way through i know a couple who makes like 3rd mil a year they just paid grand for ivf had like a dozen fertilized eggs grown to blastocyst paid another grand to have them all genetically sequenced found half with genetic issues then picked the best out of the remaining and used that one

nothing to see just israel doing some israeli stuff
with the backing of the u s israel is untouchable palestine and its people wont exist by the year or sooner fuck israel ok fuck them
what s the context here
this is wild people say you all are anti semitic if you disagree with the violence happening here and literally in the same breath go muslims are disgusting murderers and rapists this entire comment section genuinely terrifies me i truly believe the israeli government does terrible things towards palestinians to a genocidal degree i also believe that palestinians form radical and terroristic groups that threaten the safety and wellbeing of israel however it s a verifiable fact that israel bombs raids and attacks places with a high concentration of women and children over 5th of all civilian casualties in the last decade were children abd mostly because israel targeted mosques schools and hospitals where children were located at it s facts gathered by the un and frankly if a country that wasn t america s ally did this the sanctions would be insane and yet the un gives them warning after warning explicitly saying that what israel is doing is definitely wrong and yet never actually reprimand them since america is number and all it s allies are protected to be genocidal abusers
uh oh this shows israel in an unflattering light time to downvote to oblivion
what s with the comments on this post are you people insane
show to full video
did nazi that coming
actually police military beating and killing people because of their views is fashism
they learned these barbaric sub human evil human rights techniques from whom
wow the hypocrisy of the people crying antisemitic the whole thing is political and is always related to hitler murdering jews but one major thing you are overlooking is how he murdered the entire people because he hated them as a whole and murdered indiscriminately including women children and the elderly it stems from the very concept of hate and fear the pattern is clear but people refuse to open their eyes
israeli strom troopers more like
this is some nazi shit they re doing to palestinians what the nazis did them in the 30s they should be the firsts to see the signs
israel does some bad stuff and isn t innocent at all between settlers to anything else you can bring up but this is missing context hamas and pla have many records of using human shields and storing equipment and stuff in schools hospitals and mosques so just this one quick video misses context of why they might be there in the first place totally uncalled for maybe in the mosque because it is a weapons cache maybe
context from my understanding al aqsa is shared by muslim and jewish people with each having a turn someone from the muslim side decided to as a group refuse to leave the place once their turn was up then the police entered edit i m from israel but i have zero knowledge about the religious practices in jerusalem this was my understanding of the situation i did not try to lie just read somewhere it was being barricaded
wtf this is some bs
ban all religions
preguntan cual es el contexto claro cmo si los putos judos no pudieran ser malas personas
context is good
thanks for your post im totally dropping my support to israel hope thath make the word a better place
i generally support israel they have been a loyal ally and i root for democracies when they are opposed by dictators but i just don t understand how the order was given to invade the mosque during ramadan and beat women and children and why the soldiers would obey such an order it feels like israel is dehumanizing the palestinians to make it easier to take more land and beat them so this way they don t have to feel guilty if i have a major foreign policy issue with president biden its while he is focused elsewhere the conditions in the occupied territories are becoming intolerable
i just automatically assume any anti israeli posts are bullshit at this point no need to even look into them anymore
shitbag soldiers
right up there with us cops
this is very poorly veiled attempt at stoking antisemitic rhetoric its definitely not interestingasfuck quit your bullshit op
considering the muslims were refusing to leave technically they were in the wrong i don t agree with the approach but not my country so i don t know if this is normal or not
man seeing videos like this makes me remember how shitty it is here in america seeing all these groups getting the shit beat out of them is nothing compared to what s happening in america
idk what they are saying but if it s the muslims getting the beating it s prob def is well deserved
where was allah to protect them was he in a coma
forced conversions mansluaghter rapes of women of other ethnicity justifying violence in the name of god and u think they are innocent in their books its clearly written who doesnt follow islam should be converted of killed
muslims deserve this
so nobody here has any facts or context just checking
amazing fuck it
based
good job
             
wtf hate filled bastards let them pray you cowards
that s like watching a video of a palestinian murdring jews with a kitchen knife on the street and saying this is typical palestinian stuff
palestinians and arabs already tried that genocide thing on the jews in but they failed they tried it also in actually they re still trying it to this day
religion poisons everything
i hate someone and i want you to hate them too
this is exactly true there is not a true good side in this conflict but israel is far and away incredibly cruel in its treatment of palestinians in my opinion and i am sure it is not shared by everyone they have no right to take their land away to make their settlements they also bomb heavily populated palestinian areas israel is protected far more than any other country would be if they did the same thing
well that s exactly what s happening here so i d say fascism is a pretty good term to use
many american jews do see this https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-finds-a-quarter-of-us-jews-think-israel-is-apartheid-state/

weapons cache you are dumb as hell a weapon cache inside a mosque dafuq
this makes it okay
this is a lie and you know that there is a western wall which is on a different side for jews al aqsa mosque is for muslims only and the othodox church is for christians only this is an established fact and agreed upon by all three religious leaders according to israeli news reports themselves the police received info that there were people inside and riots about to happen there were people inside because it s the holy month of ramadan and people pray night and day inside the compound what you are seeing is the people being beaten and assaulted for worshipping there are no weapons or barricades we can see that could prevent israeli troops but they were on an ego drive and did this under the cover of night for this brutal assault
what an outrageous disgusting lie typical
https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/t\_share/mtc2mjy3ndczmjqxndq5njq1/when-the-internet-turned-atheism-into-a-joke.png
tu opinion prejucia tu pregunta pues hay malas personas en todos pases
reports claims that after the evening prayers some ppl barricaded themselves inside the mosque with molotov cocktails and rocks the israeli police took the bait and tried to disperse them by force this had probably came in response to the announcement of some jewish extremists of their plan to sacrifice a goat in the mosque area on pesach eve a plan stopped as well by the israeli police
i honestly don t know where to stand in the whole mess i constantly hear that the israelis are the bad guys then it s the palestinians and back and forth so honestly yeah i haven t bothered to look into it myself
this isn t antisemitic we are seeing military action on civilians can you elaborate
yeah those israelis are being crazy antisemitic towards those muslims
removed
why should muslims leave a mosque would jews leave the western wall or christians leave the orthodox church no because each of these are rightfully each religion s
yes the people who are getting rockets and bombs thrown at them daily have no idea the plight an american citizen has to go through
find me such a video because all the videos i ve seen coming out of that area lately are of israeli s burning homes shooting journalists and fucking around with people trying to hold a funeral
it s more like watching a video of a palestinian asking a man from new york to not take his families home because the israeli government said it s cool as long as you claim jewish heritage except those nigerian jews of course for some reason israel wants to put up a fight about acknowledging them as truly jewish search up yaakov fauci for anyone interested in that specific story with the new yorker
if someone showed up at my house and said god promised me this house my great grandfather s grandfather rented it years ago and i m here to claim what s mine and remove you yeah i d be pissed too then add them killing a bunch of my friends and family into the mix and i might want them dead too israel and the jewish people in that region are not in the right here but that s just like my opinion
people poison everything
i agree this is disgusting no matter the context
christopher hitchens has entered the chat
people poison religion
if they razed the whole building and put up a mall
these guys were burning fire crackers inside mosque police are just trying to control any mishap and if you think police can do it peacefully with folded hands then you are from a different planet
i share your opinion
this term is coined in accent rome because it was not that normal to see people being attacked for little to no reason in rest of the world at that time it was modus operandi so same for middle east
oh i can completely understand why there is insurgency militia s and armies and fighting from the palestinians if such a thing was happened in any country the same very similar stuff would take place
yes you can even just google weapons cache mosque school hospital and insert whoever you want isis taliban hamas pla al qaida or however you spell it
missing a lot of context is it actually woman and children being beat why are people being beat why are the soldiers police there ect it s quite possible the post is basically as the title describes quite possible there is a lot more going on
while what the op said is not true what you are saying is not true as well israeli police released the video of them entering the mosque fireworks were being shot thrown at them doors were barricaded shut and there were some fairly massive stones that were dropped on the police from above as well do you know of any religious purpose for bringing hundreds of fireworks into a historic religious site and then setting them off in the direction of people
if that was the case we should see small bonfires from molotov cocktails and people with pitchforks fighting back but we don t we should see this on israeli media about the riots and the bonfires but the media itself was refused access or even allowed to be near the grounds the people were praying during ramadan it is traditional to break fast at night
but there is not any graphical evidence of those claims all the videos from the last hours of al aqsa show pacific and unarmed people being harassed or beaten by israeli military
keep spreading lies anything to absolve israel of blame or wrongdoing
at this point israel could build a wall around the mosque so the muslims won t be able to throw rocks at the jews below let the muslims have their molotov burn their own mosque to the ground oh firefighters they were too afraid to come due to the stone throwing too bad
in the battle of the civilized vs uncivilized you generally wanna side with the civilized
the video is not antisemitic ops posting of this video in multiple subs accusing the israelis of violence and lacking any context to substantiate it is very clearly an effort to stoke antisemitic rhetoric
we got anti fascist cells everywhere
it is a shared mosque it was the end of the muslims time and was now time for the christians the muslims refused to leave
so never ever a palestinian murdered an innocent jew that s what you re saying you re just waiting for a video is that it
not doctors they aren t allowed to
i miss that guy
turn it into a toxic waste dump it isn t the site of the temple anyway that is the best part both sides fighting over an old roman fort
if that s the case it should be on israeli news reports there was nothing like this sort only from israeli military but that even wasn t confirmed by the israeli media or international stop spreading lies
yeah christian and jews too in their church
so israel faced resistance during an illegal raid occupied people have the right to resist per the geneva convention and the un charter
wait which is true though
lol https://www.reddit.com/r/askmiddleeast/comments/12cnid0/is_there_really_a_reasonable_way_to_stop_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
hamas doesn t like to fight face to face they like to sneak up from behind
beating women who are praying speaks for itself israel is run by religious nationalist there is no difference between them and any other religious nationalists they all worship the state a giant false idol
how can the mosque be shared a mosque by definition is for muslims why would christians have any interest in coming to a mosque when there is a holy orthodox church minutes away
it is not at all shared no one who isn t muslim is allowed to enter because islam
most of medicine is just mildly poisoning people until they get healthy
i m a christian and i miss him
google the same thing but add cnn washington post fox news or whatever other news source you d like and you ll find stuff as well people all over the world have done and still do this from hamas to al shabab to insurgency in the philippines it has nothing to do with lies or taken from the position of anti palestinian it s just literally a fact that insurgents around the world do this and it also includes hamas and such and no i am not saying nor have i that these palestinians are hamas or terrorists still saying there is not a lot of context to know what s going on here or why it s happening to support or oppose israel or palestinian in this situation
it s not an illegal raid fireworks were used as weapons last year against peaceful jewish worshippers and police knew that fireworks were being stockpiled in the mosque again this year do you have a suggestion for how to handle that situation in a way that you would describe as legal

and the finns have more experience successfully repelling the russians than most
kaliningrad is about to develop claustrophobia once turkey and sweden solve their beef
putin is a prize idiot how else did he really think this would work out
so would you say the russians are now finnished
ooof size maximum
i m surprised sweden is not in nato also surprised turkey ratified finlands acceptance
i like the phrase fuck around find out for moments like this
no previous russian leader was crazy enough for finland to join that s quite a boast
it s weird almost like invading another country put your other neighbors on edge and they said oh fuck that shit i m not getting invaded
this should be on r facepalm invade ukraine to reinforce that we wont accept nato on our doorstep nato s footprint on the border doubles in a year
now we wait for russian apologists to act like nato is forcing nations to join warsaw pact style it s almost like when you act like a drunken horde of revanchist barbarians your neighbors will seek out alliances to avoid being sucked into the krokodil addled black hole that is the russian sphere of influence
lol all putin achieved what making nato bigger and stronger
and in a stroke of genius putin has transformed ukraine into a permanently hostile neighbor for the next century at least so except for belarus the whole western is hostile
putin natos best salesman
i didn t know poland joined nato that late
i could imagine russias is not super excited about this
i think if push came to shove finland could ve handled russia on their own even before joining nato not sure how putin expects all this to turn out
fuck russia
it s almost like if russia didn t have such awful foreign relations with their neighbors there wouldn t be an issue also nato is a purely defensive treaty if russia doesn t plan any invasions or declare any more wars there won t be a problem
russia when the people they keep threatening continue to make friends
so does finland have to ratify sweden now
this should be much bigger news than it is it is the exact opposite of what putin thought would happen by invading ukraine even if russia somehow wins the ukraine war they really lost by finland joining nato
good work vladimir s
bold of them to not include belarus as a border
can someone explain this as a harry potter or avengers plot
dumbfuckistan on the right
thats the dumbest looking i have ever seen
what s the update on ukraine s application i know they re essentially blocked until the war is over but still i m curious
why are slovenia and croatia gray on that map we are both part of nato
russia we should do something about nato influence we should attack our neighbor that should stop others from considering going against us
it s pretty easy for russia to have a buffer state between them and nato they just need to cede the territory around finland into a new country
so now we have all of the vikings in nato we can probably repel an alien invasion
yep nato is just biding its time quietly gathering new members all to waste millions of lives and trillions of dollars to invade a shithole kleptocracy for purposes not yet clear s
when sweden joins would nato be able to block entrance or exit of russian ships in out of the baltic
sweden may not be in yet but are pretty protected now the most vulnerable spot is the island but that s being fortified
id be mad if i were russia but this is their doing
someone call borat we need to get kasakhstan into nato
we got gotland checkmate for defending estonia latvia and lithuania
r mapporn
another example why russkie invasion into ukraine was never about nato
will be interesting seeing if the usa will establish bases anywhere in finland if finland will ditch the to make logistics easier will the nordic defensive efforts focus on finsland with both the norwegian and swedish border being closeable from northern finnland joint nordic army commands when sweden joins
is it me or does this map have the worst coloring choices
side note that is terrible is it a or
the mighty nato wall
what the fuck is going on with that font is ita or
what if putin has just been a troll this whole time and his purpose is to destroy russia his antics remind me of things like the church of the flying spaghetti monster birds aren t real etc where it s such elaborate satire that people are unsure
how long before a missile rocket accidentally crosses that new boarder which side is going to accidentally loose a rocket missile across that new boarder while training anyone know a good gambling site for this
i always forget about mini russia north of poland
if they add belarus to russia officially that will be one hell of a border
hell yeah suck it putin
random thought if putin annexed belarus the border would be even bigger
i think it s time to make koningsberg part of imperial prussia once again
is erdolf still holding the kurds in sweden hostage
i think all of the western border of belarus can be seen as a de facto nato russia border too at least it probably has to be seen as such when nato plans the defense of poland and the baltic states
you re so near to russia so far from japan quite a long way from cairo lots of miles from vietnam finland finland finland the country where i want to be eating breakfast or dinner or snack lunch in the hall finland finland finland finland has it all
i hope putin is gone russia becomes democracy and joins the eu in the future i hate to see such a wonderful country with rich culture and history getting fucked by a lunatic
nato gets stronger russia weaker
unprovoked attack
good job putin
breaking treaties is a good thing
time for a little finntroll intermission
and far in the distance a rolling chorus of blyat can be heard coming from the direction of the kremlin
check putin
such a heckin good thing wow this is epic
russia should pull a real 5d chess move and join nato
russia when the pepple they keep threatening continue to make friends
what this map does not show is that finland is just km away from the second most important city in russia saint petersburg which has federal status and some government structures reside there
the math should really include belarus nato borders as well if you re being honest about military projection borders the best comparison is russia belarus ukraine borders with nato before ukraine got rid of their pro russia leadership followed by russia belarus nato pre finland borders followed by russia belarus nato post finland borders and followed by possible future forecasts one with ukraine fully reverting to russia so russia belarus ukraine borders with nato one with ukraine losing the official war goals of russia s invasion se ukraine becomes russian but ukraine joins nato and one where russia is entirely kicked out of ukraine including crimea that spread of lines shows something very important the best case for russian border goals is a full annexation of ukraine but even in that best case russia is in a losing scenario due to finland the only way russia wins the border fight is under the assumption that ukraine would have joined nato even without russian aggression and so the comparison is russia belarus borders with a ukraine inclusive nato or russia belarus ukraine borders with a nato that includes finland in which case russia pushing finland into nato is a problematic trade but not necessarily a bad one due to gaining full ukrainian access to the black sea at the potential cost of it s north sea presence
does anyone else see godzilla or is it just me
lol wut is that font
what was the catalyst in
ah yes my favorite north atlantic countries of finland estonia latvia lithuania poland czechia slovakia hungary and romania

god how i wish that silly sliver of russia between poland and lithuania would just get reabsorbed an absolute eyesore of stolen occupied land
the true iron curtain

simo hyh about to make his grand return
me to russia stop hitting yourself
wut s good estonia
why is italy not blue
russia has invaded every neibghouring country before what could be better now that they are all allied up together a little oopsie from russia
i just enjoy the fact that the entire goal of the war in ukraine was to stop the land border with russia and the outcome will be an even bigger land border regardless whether ukraine lose the war or not
putin is a putz if he was worried about nato before i wonder how he feels about them now
why italy isn t colored
strategic backfire for putin not only does this almost double the nato border it also turns the baltic into a nato dominated lake and allows nato to directly threaten russia s military assets in the kola peninsula poopin has set back russia s strategic goals for decades if not centuries
how do you say miscalculation in russian
this makes me smile
so how is the war to avoid been cornered by nato going
we invaded ukraine to stop nato expanding
i know nothing of finland s geography but do they have a naval yard or some kind of military dock on the northern border at all wasn t sure what kind of access they had or if they had a land agreement with someone
bonus points for the border being adjacent to there oil industry
kaliningrad doesn t really count let s be honest here putin quadrupled the border with nato and when this war is over it ll get significantly larger
poor belarus why belarus join eu and nato economic development and trade opportunities a standard currency that s protected from hyper inflation travel and labour mobility a globally recognized passport entrenched freedoms there are all kinds of reasons uh huh and if i stay allies with russia you get to take part in an endless war and sanctions fearing assassination the moment you stop being useful oh and they consider you subhuman compared to muscovites a lowly dumbass potato farmer who is too stupid to know you re being used such hard choice if i go to eu and nato will i be colonel like with comrade putin i have hat and uniform already
georgia s not getting any
really all belarusian borders should just be counted as russian borders
these poor russian sympathizers are just pathetic now nothing more than a blip on the reddit screen as small and insignificant as their homeland mother russia she s a cuck with a bald pinocchio running things about as poorly as anyone has in history putin is scarred just like all of russia and they should be the walls of democracy are closing in around russia and their fear and pain is the sweetest thing to see on a daily basis fuck russia their strength is gone and their presence in the world is now irrelevant good riddance russia enjoy your sanctions

the muscle memory on this guy is next level
i don t even have a witty comment this guy just fucks
wow this is honestly more technical than almost any piano piece i ve seen
he is very talented i have played w him before
i stopped reading the title at playing drums and started watching the video
incredible thanks for sharing
blind or not you d still make that face i guess
fuck yes homie shreds
imagine if he could play that on the drums
so he s like steve wonder or ray charles but on electronic keyboard so he can easily change instruments very nice that would be a tough act to follow i think
thats pretty cool was he difficult to keep up with i imagine he would be very fast
hell yea
to be honest this would be significantly easier to play on the drums because it wouldn t require such intense precision and he d also have the aid of his feet i d much rather play this solo on a kit or an aux percussion setup than on a keyboard the dude is going much harder than is strictly necessary because he s just that much of a badass
he can sing pretty well too
luckily for me we weren t playing that type of music we where playing traditional mexican music and he was playing the accordion it was a lot of fun he is blind but very talented he plays all types of music
