i suspect a marine borer
dusty old bones full of green dust
in what country do you live in
thats kief sprinkle it on your bowl and strap in
what color is the underlayment of your laminate flooring
soylent green
taste it
pollen … looks like it’s blowing into the space from the balcony and settling onto the floor
my guess is maybe above the door frame and it’s just falling down you see it on the ledge too you will need to look up and inspect there pest theory fits
sniff it and find out
it’s bad and really should completely be redone but if that’s not an option you might be able to remove all of the white trim around the treads and risers remove the gold metal bullnose replace the bullnose with a wood bullnose  i think you can get fabricated bullnose at the home improvement stores but it will still take some carpentry skills and then carpet the treads and risers
when in doubt add more quarter round id start by removing all the extra trim and see what type actually working with
if you aren’t going to replace the treads and risers i’d replace the metal with a wood stair nosing and remove the quarter round and replace it with cove moulding id also consider painting the risers white to match the mouldings
til you can pimp your stairs
this is a total tear out and start from scratch some of the poorest workmanship i’ve ever seen i’m speechless
retrim that out of your life…
holy quarter round
hopefully you can source the flooring or find something that matches anyway tear it up and order the proper treads and risers that goes with flooring also with the way the steps extend further than the white diagonals there’s probably old flooring stacked up under there which also raises a concern for me maybe there’s some bad wood under it all that was fixed by piling on more i hope i’m wrong but i would keep tearing it apart until i knew the stringers are good one more thing i’d redo all that baseboard trim so it has all the proper cutsangles why is there baseboard on the top right but quarter round on the top left then what is going on in the lower right you got this
this is where i am currently at i think it’s looking better
rip it out  start over fix the skirtboard  baseboards find a stairnose to match the flooring on top white riser stain oak treads
either borrowbuyrent sawzall and cut the legs off at the concrete if youre worried about it falling on you while cutting hook a rope to the top of it and your car and just give it a little tug to pull it over first before cutting
offer it up for free on the internet bet someone would remove it for the scrap value
why not park your cars under it instead of letting them bake in the sun the heat and uv rays will accelerate paintinterior deterioration
dont remove carport remove metal panels paint structure reinstall new panels
i sure wouldnt trust some scrapper come to take it down id call then after it is down to come get it
yeah i would but i drive a suv that barely fits and my gf can’t park to save her life it just seems to be in the way more than anything plus it looks like ass lol
i wouldnt think twice about it someone may want it as a car port also
if it is water damage best to cut a strip point a fan in the hole and dry it out to prevent mold then repair with standard dry wall methods if the water damage is slight and you are sure there is no more water prime with killz all drywall mud sand and paint
play inagaddadavida every time you open your garage and pretend it’s supposed to happen
resolved bad bulb thanks all yes im an idiot
have you replaced the bulb i’ve had several led bulbs fail like this in other applications eg bathroom fixtures some intermittently
safety reversing sensors misaligned
dance party flash dance time lol i see you solved it
see above where i said i checked everything well that everything except the bulb big thanks to you
no i checked everything the small led that blinks a code just stays steady green this light bulb flashing is intermittent too happens for a few days then works as it should for months
does the main button have a lock button next to it
it does a sliding switch its off whats odd is the same model installed on the nd door the same day has a light on the wall switch that goes out when its locked but is otherwise always on
you get her a kennel and a whole bunch of chew toys you kennel her when youre not home and when you are  you watch her and tell her no when she starts to destroy and give her something to chew on look for chew toys that are designed for heavy chewers so it will keep her busy for longer
a lot more exercise too tired to destroy anything bicycle or a skateboard are good options
bored dogs chew are you walking your dog daily or doing enrichment dogs need stimulation and exercise chewing and ripping things are usually signs of boredom or under stimulation
training
if you want your dog to be calm you have to train with calmness you can also train them to use a crate i suggest you look up some training techniques on youtube they are incredibily helpful even if you are an experienced owner it really doesnt matter that the dogs a  pit bull im  german but i dont goose step everywhere
you’re asking the wrong sub… there’s got to be lots of dog training subs i bet you’d be much better off asking there
they make a bar to attach to bike and dog so it keeps you and them safe from them getting caught up in the spinning tires i don’t currently use one as we’re in the middle of moving but my dog took a few slow rides to get used to how far to keep her distance and for me to get used to how to give her moreless space more easily as we ride she loves “bike”
its probably your make up feed valve leaking by
i assume theres some kind of float valve like in a toilet that may be stuck and is letting the water fill up too high
dirty water or a high ph level can cause this issue get someone to look at it
obviously there’s a lot it could be but i had this same issue with the boiler in my last house our burner did both the radiant heat and our hot water inside the boiler there is a tankless hot water coil and that had a small leak so it was constantly leaking fresh water into the closed loop heating system it started out slow so it would take a few weeks before the pressure really built up then over time it progressed to a few days i would just relieve pressure from the system from the relief valve to keep it in line most of the cost of the replacement was in the labor since our system was rather old and corroded and they have to take it all apart if i remember right it was about  to replace the coil  years ago
this is a steam boiler there will be no tankless coil that is a sight glass for water level
