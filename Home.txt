i live in denmark and trying to achieve this look in my garden with plants that can actually survive here üòÇ
your dream home seems to be two homes with two front doors
if you cant get the flowers you want to grow in a box consider artificial plants some of them are indistinguishable from real plants and theyll last multiple years with very little care
i suspect a marine borer
dusty old bones full of green dust
what color is the underlayment of your laminate flooring
in what country do you live in
thats kief sprinkle it on your bowl and strap in
pollen ‚Ä¶ looks like its blowing into the space from the balcony and settling onto the floor
taste it
id suspect some sort of insect activity
soylent green
my guess is maybe above the door frame and its just falling down you see it on the ledge too you will need to look up and inspect there pest theory fits
termites we get little round brown wood balls as remnants
sniff it and find out
might be termites
termites
whats above this spot same explanation as the floor but above
near a doorwindowcrack possibly pollen
pollen
try to smoke it
termites
dust of the underlayment of the laminate flooring
alien cocaine
collect it and sell as rapture powder to dispensationalists
hulk scratching his back on your wall corner
i vote gnomes
may have been the location of the cutsaw where the dust wasnt properly vacuumed after the install gathering behind baseboard trim and under first row of sheetrock
i suspected the underlayment is breaking down
pollen
looks like ectoplasm condensate id call ghostbusters
i have some blue dust in my kitchen that looks like its the same consistency as yours mine comes up around the corners especially the outside corners you know that corners that protrude into the rest of the room i have a blue underlayer on the cheap fauxlaminate flooring so i think like someone else mentioned its the grinding and blowing that cause it to appear
im certain its pollen
look up filtration soils
near a door to the outside‚Ä¶ pollen its spring
does walter white live nearby
pollen
looks like old padding from the lvp turned to dust and surfaced it would make sense in a door way too since i mostly see this in high traffic areas that have been wet a few times it just degrades as it dries each time until its dust then it finds its way up to the surface with vibration and airflow
soylent green
is that carpet on the other side could it be the padding breaking down there were a ton of comments maybe someone already said this
pollen
clean it up then put a dry towel over that corner including the trim if it gathers on top or bottom will tell you where to look next
sorry english is not my first language and this translates into nonsense in my language do you mean insects like termites or something
hes your bully hank
üòÇüòÇ
i was hoping to see this üòÇ
now that you say it when i moved in years ago they had to repair parts of the floor and there was green dust everywhere but it doesnt explain why it keeps coming back in this particular spot i was just curious might not investigate further since im moving out tomorrow
my guess as well
yup pollen is my guess too
its people
always boof before smoking an unknown substance safety first bro
edge of mounding looks like wood rot‚Ä¶
yes insect
you can look up the words as an english google search and then either look at the images which show an insect and the damage they do or the more in depth descriptions which should translate better
i hate that kid so much i skip the episode lol
just saw that episode yesterday lol
you said its next to the door maybe closing the door vibrates the ground a little around the frame causing it to grind up then drafts from the outside blow it up to the surface
you either have termites or a mouse eating through the flooring i had dust like this in a closet emptied the closet to find several little holes in the wall and floor that a mouse was chewing through
wait what
i have seen it before when there is a bunch of dust under a floor like that there are small air pocket under the floor so as you walk on it the air blows out somewhere usually near a wall or in this case a door and with that air you get some of the dust underneath coming out as well you might be able to see it if you clean it up then walk from the other side of the room toward that spot
the fact that people are downvoting you is so stupid my girlfriends first language isnt english so i have her spell it to me in her language and then i look it up and times that works when google translate fails
so do i those parents are insufferable and the kid is obnoxious
i just fast forward to when bobby reluctantly becomes a bully back lol
worst episode of the series by far
this happens to me at my place and i live in kc mo
this is my thought as well except instead of vibrating it looks to me like the corner of that section in left edge of photo is getting smashed when door opens looks like the hinge could be on that inside corner then wind is blowing thru cracks in door onto that smashed edge freeing the dust to land on floor in that pattern
yeah could be that or i was thinking that closing the door could form a small vacuum in a cavitycrack in the floor pulling out enderlayment dust that was ground up from vibrationpressure of walking or door vibration
just ask yourself ‚Äúwhat is the function of this device‚Äù and go from there
i like to fix stuff myself whenever possible and dont have access to a welder if it were me this is what id do looks to be hollow and cracked all the way through so id take out the bolt underneath the rail to separate the two pieces shave down a piece of wood so that it slides into each opening snugly think like a large rectangle dowel spread a glue on it that is capable of bonding to both materials construction adhesivegorilla glue tap it into the corner side so its seated against the end then slide on the rail reattach the screw when done if needed for looks sand the crack and touch up with paint
is it aluminum if it is maybe jb weld it
super glue and a bottle of jack and you wont notice a thing
yes the material is thin and will be hard to weld as is you might have to put a plate on the side and weld that to the banister aluminum or steel
yes it needs to be welded to do it correctly
braze it
this approach sounds nice and robust if the metal were thick enough looking again i suspect not might even add a pair of countersunk screws into the wood dowel one on each side of the crack do it properly so the screws are flush and then just fill inpaint the the screws so theyre invisible
jb weld would probably hold up better than gorilla glue and you can shape it to look like weld
good advice but use jb weld vs gorilla glue
wrestle a hungry polar bear and your bannister problem is solved forever
its bad and really should completely be redone but if thats not an option you might be able to remove all of the white trim around the treads and risers remove the gold metal bullnose replace the bullnose with a wood bullnose i think you can get fabricated bullnose at the home improvement stores but it will still take some carpentry skills and then carpet the treads and risers
when in doubt add more quarter round id start by removing all the extra trim and see what type actually working with
if you arent going to replace the treads and risers id replace the metal with a wood stair nosing and remove the quarter round and replace it with cove moulding id also consider painting the risers white to match the mouldings
til you can pimp your stairs
this is a total tear out and start from scratch some of the poorest workmanship ive ever seen im speechless
retrim that out of your life‚Ä¶
holy quarter round
hopefully you can source the flooring or find something that matches anyway tear it up and order the proper treads and risers that goes with flooring also with the way the steps extend further than the white diagonals theres probably old flooring stacked up under there which also raises a concern for me maybe theres some bad wood under it all that was fixed by piling on more i hope im wrong but i would keep tearing it apart until i knew the stringers are good one more thing id redo all that baseboard trim so it has all the proper cutsangles why is there baseboard on the top right but quarter round on the top left then what is going on in the lower right you got this
this is where i am currently at i think its looking better
rip it out start over fix the skirtboard baseboards find a stairnose to match the flooring on top white riser stain oak treads
wtf remove everything that will come off and carpetrugrunner
a nifty trick is to use the click flooring right over existing wood
oh man thats a good one haha this is something my dad would do in his home vs a home owners house that would drive me nuts
buy finished treads and risers paint or stain
what happened in the first place
trim on the bottom right lookin like a snuffed out cigarette
man that is something id pull it all and do it from scratch it looks like lock boxes stacked on each other
with all that decorative wood work theres got to be a decent subframe removeredo redo the wallstring and match w the risers simple oak treads white risers will look great
good luck op next project level out those cabinet and drawer pulls it maybe an optical illusion but they look crooked af to me
i recommend polishing them up with glossy wood oil and then adding a spitsworth of fire do you have insurance
i actually like the parquet for risers‚Ä¶ never seen it before and it has awoken something‚Ä¶ the quarter round need to come off the brass too put down now treads leave the parquet maybe its just because im a celtics fan
what about putting in a runner as well
priceless‚Ä¶
the grain is going the wrong way on the treads üòÇ and is that parquet on the risers just wow my recommendation add gasoline burn rebuild
remove the toe trim on eat step
they sell matching bull nose and quarter round for that wood color some pvc some actual wood id remove the gold bull nose amd white quarter round and replace with matching wood color trim thats a start awfully orange
quarter round is the hallmark of ignorance others have given you good advice im just here to gawk
i stubbed my toe and twisted my ankle falling forward just looking at these
ya wow that is really bad
what in the absolute slumlord rental property is this
putting the ‚Äúno‚Äù in nose molding
the huge issue is the side baseboards use x or x on the sides and get rid of that round stuff baseboards get painted white and all that half round paint a brown if you have to keep it or replace with oak x trim stained to match the metal bull nose pull off and paint paint it a full iron color or something‚Ä¶replace it if you can
rip out put in an elevator
if you end up painting and want to get contractor pricing at any sherwin williams let me know no catch just happy to let you use our acct same goes for anyone else in here
theres lots of wack here
i saw your updated pics looks awesome great job had to comment on the trim on the bottom step looks so redic
id remove literally all trim thats around the stairs the baseboards and quarter round pieces‚Äîall of it it just looks really bad home depot sells small sized dowels in different shapes in the lumber section id get some small enough where you can fill in the gaps glue them or nail them in place and then try to match the stain as best as i could the vertical to horizontal step transitions can probably be filled in with some type of wood putty and then stained this all depends on how big the gaps are id love to see another photo of the steps sans trim bits
i wish i could look at this and say only the trim looked bad to me way too much textures colors materials etc
paint them dark brown
inexpensivedecent fix pop off all the white trim and gold tread go to lowes and find x sticky floor tiles they have a great variety run the sticky tiles on tops and backs of stairs theyre easy to cut and easy to line up and surprisingly durable while at lowes get thin angled wood strips to replace the gold treads stain them whatever color you choose and repaint stair edges that meet the wall you can do all of this for under and hours including dry time
this picture makes me feel a whole lot better about the look of the stairs i just finished you need to name and shame the previous owner if youre also redoing the floor above check out the readymade vinyl stair treads you can usually get them to match most flooring i wish i had gone that route
ffs this thing sucks im sorry you had to inherit such dogshit work the casing on the door is wrong it should have either hit the floor flush or on top of a plinth block the base on the wall should die into the casing or into the plinth at the top of the stairs it should transition correctly with the correct angle into the run if base that trims out the walls above the top landing the shoe is‚Ä¶ utter dog shit rip all of that garbage out of there get rid of that brass nose and see whats under there if its just a square machine edge you could leave it or round it over with a router you will need to use a file to round the remainder close to the walls because the router baseplate will stop you from going all the way a quick fix for the patchwork riser would be to skin it with ‚Äù plywood and paint it white
hire a professional that is cray
if you are handy with a skill saw or saw of your choice you could cut a custom stringer for each side of the existing stringers remove all the quarter round and install your new stringers sand patch and paint i think there are videos on this lmk if you would like a link
remove the treads and install solid oak treads the nosing s look like shit
plywood and turn it into a ramp if anyone is over lbs then use plywood
yeah thats so bad whoever did that was a hack have to remove the molding and see what you have to work with maybe you can just caulk the cracks
carpet
take the trim off and do caulking or carpet its hideous or paint it all
good god it got worse every time i looked at it again looks like the previous owner or handyman was the adventurous type but also possessed the good enough trait seen in all those diwhy videos id tear everything out and completely restart you couldnt do any worse
omg my eyes
you could just remove the trim exposing the cracks but then again crack is wack
yeah thats a real busy mess quarter round is probably hiding the edges of the wood flooring so removing it will expose them requiring pulling the whole mess off its gotta go man no repairs replace
the longer you look the worse it gets
whoever set those stairs and had it trimmed like that needs to be executed looks like shit
remove white trim
paint the riser
paint the vertical parquet white might be a quick fix until you can do something more permanent
its just the molding for me i bet if you found something less distracting and put a nice dark stain on that wood it would look really good maybe match the tone of the cabinets
if you have a router you could make some small trim to be installed in place of the white trim if you stain it to a similar shade as the steps they will be about invisible
wow op what a diy nightmare ive seen your recent photos and its a better you did good now your problem is the messy door frame and haphazard molding i think youre doing great eta wth do people not build steps with equivalent risers ive got two sets in my house
finished edge technology az
carpet runners
easy mode is paint the trim to something darker buy some sticky tab vinyl flooring of your choosing to replace pave over the flooring id probably cut some new trimming to get rid of that gap lol
rip out and add oak treads and new risers
new oak treads
yes get actual hardwood stair treads it looks like these were covered in leftover flooring material
burn it
colour it all white‚Ä¶ then put a dark colour carpet at the centre
yeahhh thats bad sand and stain and for the love of god get rid of the qr
wood bull nose and white risers would help after you remove the existing molding
just rip it all out and redo it its only three steps
hand grenade
looks like it took more time and effort than if they just replaced treads and risers
hammer
thank you and i completely agree its such an eyesore im slowly working on redoing this entryway id love to remove the vinyl flooring on top of the steps and hope for the best underneath them but i might have a hard time convincing my husband to let me do this lol
i suspect its ugly if you remove the quarter round prepare to remove all of the flooring on the steps
well i started tearing it all up haha üòÇ the flooring underneath is alright definitely needs some sanding and replacement but it already looks so such better
yo dawg we heard you like bullnose so we put bullnose on your bullnose
that is the plan lol currently tearing it up as i type
its difficult to believe someone covered up beautiful parquet flooring with that hot mess not everyone is a fan of parquet‚Ä¶ but sanded stained and finished properly those will looks beautiful what an awesome find under there you can absolutely make them shine even if you eventually replace them great job even as is it is infinitely better i agree with the other poster that you could stain them to match the cabinets and it blend well with the aesthetic üòä
this our entryway so i really dont wanna do rug i plan on doing that for the other set of stairs tho lol but yes definitely wtf haha
yuck
its been driving me nuts since we moved in
no clue we bought the house in september theres a lot of odd things in the house i dont think its been given a lot of love over the years lol
lmfao ü´£üòÇ
thank you oh they are all crooked every single one of them ü´† like every other thing in this house lol its on my todo
what hahah like light it on fire or am i dumb lmao yes we do hahga
i like the parquet too heres an update image from a few minutes ago
weve stubbed our toes many times lol
thank you thats very kind of you
this what im currently working with im going to sand and stain the stairs and repair the one nose for now
ohh thats a good idea im going to try to refinish the original flooring and see how that goes if it fails i may end up doing this
hahah we do plan on redoing all the flooring on this level at some point and hiring a professional for that i just need a temporary improvement for my sanity
the thought behind the is was they are hiding something with the quarter round on the sides
yes id totally love a link thank you
yeah its a very unique diy lol thank you the flooring was very easy to take up thankfully yes the door frame is sad no idea how imma go about fixing that
in addition to what the poster said above i would make the risers white which is a really common look with woodfloored stairs the contrasting wood styles is not a good look you might be able to put a thin veneer piece over them that is white if you cant remove and replace the riser part with sold wood
better to ask forgiveness than permission
share pics
oscillating multitool
razor knife the painted joints then use a sharp trim bar put a shim or thin piece of scrap at the fulcrum point of the trom bar to prevent denting the adjacent trim
start at the end not the middle
offer it up for free on the internet bet someone would remove it for the scrap value
dont remove carport remove metal panels paint structure reinstall new panels
put a outdoor table and chairs a cooler of your favorite beverages and a grill then enjoy
why not park your cars under it instead of letting them bake in the sun the heat and uv rays will accelerate paintinterior deterioration
either borrowbuyrent sawzall and cut the legs off at the concrete if youre worried about it falling on you while cutting hook a rope to the top of it and your car and just give it a little tug to pull it over first before cutting
if you have zero experience i would just do what another commenter said and put it online for free even if they do a shit job removing it for free itll be easier to clean it up with a tool rental or cheap harbor freight type tool
i sure wouldnt trust some scrapper come to take it down id call then after it is down to come get it
yeah i would but i drive a suv that barely fits and my gf cant park to save her life it just seems to be in the way more than anything plus it looks like ass lol
i wouldnt think twice about it someone may want it as a car port also
if it is water damage best to cut a strip point a fan in the hole and dry it out to prevent mold then repair with standard dry wall methods if the water damage is slight and you are sure there is no more water prime with killz all drywall mud sand and paint
is this on the ceiling then you might want to go in the attic and pull back the insulation and see if the insulation and the drywall is wet you might have a leak somewhere if its in the wall cavity it might be a slow pipe leak mold can grow on drywall if left untreated you need to mitigate the situation first by cutting out the drywall locate the water source dry it out patch and paint
yup thats water sorry man but it least its a small leak
could you take a less helpful photo
bullet hole
looks like a burn almost anyone there smoke
yeah probably
what burn has fur
play inagaddadavida every time you open your garage and pretend its supposed to happen
resolved bad bulb thanks all yes im an idiot
have you replaced the bulb ive had several led bulbs fail like this in other applications eg bathroom fixtures some intermittently
safety reversing sensors misaligned
dance party flash dance time lol i see you solved it
some garage door openers say not to use led bulbs our old one said incandescent only
see above where i said i checked everything well that everything except the bulb big thanks to you
no i checked everything the small led that blinks a code just stays steady green this light bulb flashing is intermittent too happens for a few days then works as it should for months
does the main button have a lock button next to it
it does a sliding switch its off whats odd is the same model installed on the nd door the same day has a light on the wall switch that goes out when its locked but is otherwise always on
you get her a kennel and a whole bunch of chew toys you kennel her when youre not home and when you are you watch her and tell her no when she starts to destroy and give her something to chew on look for chew toys that are designed for heavy chewers so it will keep her busy for longer
a lot more exercise too tired to destroy anything bicycle or a skateboard are good options
bored dogs chew are you walking your dog daily or doing enrichment dogs need stimulation and exercise chewing and ripping things are usually signs of boredom or under stimulation
training
if you want your dog to be calm you have to train with calmness you can also train them to use a crate i suggest you look up some training techniques on youtube they are incredibily helpful even if you are an experienced owner it really doesnt matter that the dogs a pit bull im german but i dont goose step everywhere
youre asking the wrong sub‚Ä¶ theres got to be lots of dog training subs i bet youd be much better off asking there
they make a bar to attach to bike and dog so it keeps you and them safe from them getting caught up in the spinning tires i dont currently use one as were in the middle of moving but my dog took a few slow rides to get used to how far to keep her distance and for me to get used to how to give her moreless space more easily as we ride she loves ‚Äúbike‚Äù
its probably your make up feed valve leaking by
i assume theres some kind of float valve like in a toilet that may be stuck and is letting the water fill up too high
dirty water or a high ph level can cause this issue get someone to look at it
obviously theres a lot it could be but i had this same issue with the boiler in my last house our burner did both the radiant heat and our hot water inside the boiler there is a tankless hot water coil and that had a small leak so it was constantly leaking fresh water into the closed loop heating system it started out slow so it would take a few weeks before the pressure really built up then over time it progressed to a few days i would just relieve pressure from the system from the relief valve to keep it in line most of the cost of the replacement was in the labor since our system was rather old and corroded and they have to take it all apart if i remember right it was about to replace the coil years ago
this is a steam boiler there will be no tankless coil that is a sight glass for water level
because most airhandlers have a negative pressure drain basically if that p trap wasnt there the condensate would never be able to drain correctly due to the blower motor pulling air into the cabinet through the drain pipe
its for the condensate is it going to a sewer line
stops air leakage
so it doesnt blow conditioned air down the drain
thanks for the reply apparently the water that was trapped froze over winter and left me with a mess when turned on ac going to replace and insulate
ahhh sounds like your up north lol and heres a link if you want to learn more about condensate drains
kentucky but we had stupid cold temps last winter thanks for the info
it sure looks like it even if it aint mold it aint good
you could make an offer pending mold remediationand really do your homework and talk to the experts on how it needs to be done is it possible its just in the ducts could a whole house dehumidifier fix it
take it off and wipe it down and see how long it takes to return or if it returns
you will want to replace the ducts and plenum a few things could cause this undersized plenum hole in ducts wrong duct size so it all needs to be rebuilt to get rid of the mold but stop the cause as well
does it wash off
yes thats mold and yes its pushing it in the air at this point i bet the plenum isnt insulated and the humidity where this house is at is high search elsewhere for a home
i thought you said if it aint mold it aint gold
i was thinking the same thing which means that vent is just pushing black mold particles right on out
not sure we are thinking about buying this home to be honest this is the only ducts we saw it on
havent bought the house yet and im not buying a house that has the potential of mold spores flying around
it could be as simple as condensation from high humidity inside the house and may be limited to just the duct cover
naw its whats known as devils sperm just ignore it unless someone in the household starts floating out of their bed while screeching latin
i assume you would get a home inspection pending the sale im sure a good home inspector could tell you what the problem is id ask him to take a picture assuming it could be a compromised duct or insulation issue in the attic im dealing with an old slab home where the water supply has been repiped and there are many code violations with the electrical wiring im finding out the hard way that the plumbing gas and wiring were modified for speed not safety üò≥
looks like surface mold there are many varieties of mold in homes that arent deadly black mold remediatiors may tell you otherwise its hard to find a house that doesnt have mold somewhere crawlspace basements etc
just to set your expectations almost every house has mold in some shape or form that appears to be on the surface and is probably caused by condensation likely from a duct on an exterior wall and turning the humidifier up too high in the winter if you are in a cold environment the duct gets cold and water condenses on the duct cover the condensation supports mold growth either that or you are in a warm environment and your ac system isnt working well or is oversized so it isnt removing humidity from the house the humidity condenses on the cold duct and forms mold
that is true
thats rough yeah we are going to make an offer and have an inspector check it out if its too much money to fix the issue we just wont buy the home
i look on the bright side im learning new skills i now know how to solder copper pipe so far ive repiped feet lol
im sure theres a great chance its a oneoff issue that can be easily fixed i wish you the best
see the twisty thing above the float twist it
no need to replace anything the white plastic piece with the ‚Äúx‚Äù on it above the float turns its slotted for a phillips screwdriver you want to twist it to lower the float what is happening is that the water is not getting high enough to push the float up all the way to engage the shut off before it can fill that high it spills into the overflow in the center if you move the float down you can get it so it will shut off prior to reaching the overflow level quick way to check to see if this will solve it lift the float and see if the water stops if so adjust it
may have a water feed valve feeding the water close it so its not inline with pipe the trap valve is stuck open yank lever up and down should unstick
looks like the floater is not coming up all the way see if you can stop it manually let us know
your flapper might need replacing
buy a new valve body maybe yours is stuck its easy to change it close your water feed in the while
just replace the the valve that lifts the ball up
catch it
that filler line has a clip on the end that should be attached to that pipe piece poking up right now most of your water is going down that overflow instead of filling the reservoir
lift up the float maybe spend the putting in a new filler
ive had two things cause this one the flapper is old and needs to be replaced flappers will deform over time and not seal anymore letting water go down the drain constantly also flappers have hard water buildup that breaks the seal take it off and wipe it clean with clr flappers on my well water last about years second the float can get mineral buildup on it and now it weighs more and wont float properly clean it off so the float works as designed lastly the tank internals like the towerfloat i would replace after years not expensive that way you can work on the toilet when you want to rather than work on it when you have to edit one person household more people equals more flushes adjust accordingly
your float is stuck work it up and down and smile when you do this
this
the ole dick twist
this they do need to be replaced periodically if you have another toilet do that one at the same time do the smoke detectors too while youre at it those have a ten year lifespan and then need to be fully replaced
and tackle it to the ground
no foundation needs work
you need to fix the outside issue of water pressure against your house first
hard to tell for sure from just a picture looks like window is leaking the ground outside should be sloped away from the house downspouts should be checked to keep water away cant tell for sure from the pic but it looks like mortar mix was applied to the sill to have a pitch away from window and water is leaking through the bottom of patch see if some of the patch is loose remove loose mortar and repatch after stopping water issue
when it comes to water where it shows you in the home isnt necessarily where the water starts its infiltration you can chase the leak or just do a full depth repair
landscaping issues
im skeptical that this is a foundation issue looks to me that the glass block was set in a mortar bed on top of the foundation wall cut out and just sloped to finish against the wall its a fairly likely scenario if this is the case that the bond between the foundation and mortar has given way it shouldnt have been relied upon in the first place as a water stop but‚Ä¶ im also guessing this because thats a far to straight horizontal crack to be naturally occurring im not sure what your skill set is but id be fixing it by removing the whole block and installing a proper basement window and proper water proofing
is part of the glass block window below grade
much much much much bigger work
get in contact with a general contractor andor hardscaper theyll be able to look at the terrain outside of that spot and the general flow of water on your property and surrounding properties and give holistic solutions to the root cause of the problem believe me you dont want to sleep on this ive seen more than one cavedin basement wall because of water pressure against it im talking an entire foot section of the basement wall caved inwards they had leaking issues too but didnt address the root issue instead they just did a basement waterproofing treatment and it was in exactly the type of soil environment youre describing high clay content now im not saying that if you dont address this now your basement will implode what i am saying though is that you need to consult an expert in order to get an actual real idea of exactly how bad it is and how urgent any fix may or may not be
google penetron really helped me in similar situation
if the exterior of your house is brick or any other porous substrate it may need sealed again they do obviously weather away over the years but you can fill and seal the gap also in the mean time
you need to get the water away from the house that needs to be step check the gutters and the ground slope make sure water moves away from the foundation make sure the downspouts dont just dump the water at the outside wall could be as simple as adding dirt around the foundation to ge the water to move away hard to tell from the video
just looks to me like a bad mortar job when they installed the glass block window you can try to chip a bunch away and redo the glass block mortar check the outside of that window as well and be careful when chipping as the mortar is the only thing that holds that window in place
we had a similar issue that seemed keyed to rain but ultimately turned out to be due to a ruptured well water line near the foundation the split was maybe a half inch long if that but it was enough that it saturated the soil so bad that it seeped through the cinderblock foundation like a sponge made worse with a good soaking rain telltale sign for us was quickly dropping pressure in the well tank
‚Äúfoundation needs work‚Äù‚Ä¶wtf talk about scary words you have done issues here to deal with water is getting against your walls fix that first slope so the water flows away after it dries out you could do some repairs but honestly you could just leave it for now
bubble gum
ouch how can u tell its foundation vs an isolated issue under the window
thanks recommendation for that do i need to install ground gutters or a pump or something sorry im a noob with this stuff and just trying to get opinions before attempting to fix myself or spending loads of money on a contractor
yeah im not understanding why the cement is pitch away from the window appreciate the comment though not sure what you mean by low grade
appreciate your feedback my skill set is learn as i go üòÇ works well for simple jobs but with this im leaning towards getting someone out here to assess the problem then educating myself to either do the job or hire someone
great advice thank you this is also the room that i work in have all my music equipment in and is my man cave üòÖ looking and feeling more like a cave as the water comes in lol
nice ill check it out thanks
the giant crack that water is coming out of is kind of a dead giveaway
proper exterior drainage is a start but you need to see how the water is getting there first is there a window well there is that filling up and needs a drain or is it at ground level and the foundation needs proper slope away from the house
that is too big of a job that i am willing to tackle on my own so i dont have any recommendations on where to start except to get quotes from basement waterproofing companies in your area
get the water away from your foundation downspouts should be like feet minimum pointing away from the house if water flows back to the house probably is andor pools next to the house you need to grade the landscaping away from the foundation
if you do a vid of outside i may be able to tell you
the surface at the base of the window should have a slope so any moisture goes away from the window and doesnt sit there grade is the level of the ground outside of the house
ya i dont think youd want to take on this project though i dont think foundation problem its still a good amount of work to fix the window
haha you can feel like batman going ‚Äúspelunking‚Äù
stop i just had a root canal and i cant laugh this hard but yes op you need a lot of work on the outside of your house first then more work on the foundation
its just a bunch of little cracks that are connected should be fine after it stops raining
no window well ground level i live in an area with high clay content in the soil southeast michigan weather
im guessing youve also been hit with the recent storms ya the amount of rain is overstated the soil and your yard most yards dont have enough ground level drainage to move the water away from the foundation i dont think theres an easy fix for either problem though you could try expanding foundation foam the seal up the cracks would think it would come back though

im in the up we have a house built in a big crack in the basement wall under the same type window that leaks water like this every spring we are wanting to redo the basement but first we have to fix that it means that we have to have french drains set up all around the house to ensure the water is draining away and not directly into our basement then we can have the basement sealed but first the water must be dealt with
thanks for the input dude ill check out the french drain option as well best of luck on your house
hey pal im sorry youre having a hard time this is really the wrong sub for this i only say to let you know that youll probably get better support elsewhere this sub mainly concerns home repairs renovations etc i would really suggest that you talk to someone about your home life maybe theres a councillor at school while i dont necessarily disagree with your moms rule it sounds like the bigger issue is that youre losing an escape which can be important to have but it would be even better if you can talk through the things youre escaping from with someone that you feel safe with it wont change the landscape at home but youll feel more confident navigating it you sound like a good kid this probably seems like an overanalysis but limited screen time is a good problem to have in life if only it were the only big problem which it doesnt sound like it is im going to add that it is extremely important that the person you talk to isnt an internet stranger
im really sorry have you asked your mom why she limits you on your items when you have personally bought that stuff on your own can you ask for more time do more chores or i guess ask how you can earn more time on it like keep your grades up more chores etc see what she says
i was feeling for op until that last line if limited access to video games is causing you health problems you probably need to find something else to spend your time on your mother is right
i stfg if any of you go after this kid i will come unhinged
rlostredditors
you may have paid for the equipment but who pays for the power it uses the internet its connected to and the roof and walls that protect it
hey op i think radvice would be a great place to post this lots of good people looking to help out there
piggybacking off this comment to recommend you pop over to roffmychest for unloading stuff like this generally you can get some pretty solid advice rmenslib is also a good place for dudes to healthily discuss their mental health issues in a generally safe environment and get advice from other fellas on how deal with stuff
this is a great idea talk about it tell them you enjoy your time on it and you do take care of your responsibilities home work is done room is neat some choirs always help change the mood
also if you truly are you have great writing skills keep up the good work
in a vacuum i see your point however this is a much more complex conversation than what you are touching on besides this really isnt the sub to be attempting to help with the ops question though i genuinely hope she gets the needed support
possibly eventually looks like corrosion from pinhole leaks at the joints typically thats what the crusty part is some of the smoother discolored areas around joints could be excess flux that wasnt removed during the install the good thing is that typically the corrosion seals the leak just kind of feel around it and see if there is any signs of moisture if not i wouldnt be too concerned as its an old leak thats no longer active dont disturb it or try to clean it off with a wire brush since it would probably cause it to drip again
if pinhole leaks appear in visible pipes i would be concerned about the pipes you cant see
thank you so much
no problem i had the same concern in my last house that had a bunch of pipes like that i talked to a plumber about it when he was over fixing an issue with my well pump and that was essentially his response it looks worse than it actually is
gotcha i just moved into to this house and have no idea about the plumbing so this is very helpful thank you
you definitely want a bigger dehumidifier there are whole home dehumidifiers if you dont have ac or there are standalone units i use a pint toshiba tddpesc to dehumidify my sqft shop and it keeps up without it humidity can be up to in the spring with it it can keep it around i have it draining into a gallon barrel so i dont have to empty it daily for a small room a pint would do well
before everyone starts commenting on a typo i think you mean you bought a dehumidifier
use exhaust fans in problem rooms
if you have a crawlspace in your home consider encapsulating to help control the humidity in the home
oh thanks for letting me notice it the humidity and its result namely the worsening of the rhinitis is interfering with the normal functioning of my brain üòÇ
spray foam
this or similar
its sealing air leaks where the rim joist meets the rest of the platform framing
you got the right answer here its spray foam that said the joist appears to be wicking up water from somewhere keep a close eye on it and any others there may be an underlying issue here
its house cum basically the first cells that your house was grown from it you gather around pounds of it you can emulsify it and plant it centered in a concrete foundation the house should grow to the edge of the concrete and as high as the potenuse
why does that look like an air duct going no where
its some great stuff
not bubbly stuff thats some great stuff right there
what do you mean by wicking up water and how did you see that
that water spot to the left of and overlapped by the white circle it has a lighter center with a a dark border that doesnt match the wood grain
the discoloration and pattern on the floor joist can be seen from the rim joist to the sill plate and up towards the floor based on this pattern and discoloration it appears the joist has been wicking water up it may be related to the spray foam repair or some other water penetration it doesnt appear too bad or rotten but definitely something worth observing it looks like the joist may still have some moisture in it where its darker there are inexpensive moisture meters that can confirm the moisture content between various sections of the joist
clearly looks broken not picked lock looks like they hit it with a hammer and punch to split the cylinder
thank you im just nervous as we swapped insurance companies on renewal and their tcs state we have to have evidence of a crime proof it was forced the police officer said he thought it was picked glad i posted do you mind me asking how i would evidence in photos for the method youve said
well if you ever tire of your current vocation i predict youd have a killer locksmith youtube channel little side earner youve potentially provided more detail than ive ever received from an expert jack of all trades paid or otherwise hence me paying in compliments üò¨
well im not a lock expert or anything im an industrial mechanic but that makes me good at investigating mechanical damage it looks like the center of the key hole is indented in a round shape the top of the key hole is split apart note the large gap where the outside part of the cylinder is no longer intact it tells me that the keyhole was hit with a hardened punch and hammer to split the keyholecylinder in the lock again i admittedly dont know what im talking about it just certainly looks like what happened imo
looking at it more id say they stuck a flathead screwdriver in the key hole you can see the damage to the key hole and marks where a flat head was pounded into it either way a cop shouldve been able to deduce the lock was broken just by seeing the cylinder split at the top
im actually embarrassed i didnt notice the bloody piece missing at the top i must have spent hours accumulatively trying to assessgoogleyoutube their methods of getting in so much so im sure i could pick a lock now ü´£
no worries like i said i basically inspect mechanical equipment all day so finding that stuff is easier after years props to you for trying to educate yourself never know when you might need to bust one yourself in an emergency down the road the officer should be embarrassed but then again im sure lots of stuff isnt covered in months of training s
looks like standard checking which is normal for timbers that size should be fine
standard checking
no for context the top of the beam is under compression the bottom of the beam is under tension the center of the beam horizontally has to accommodate these opposing forces but is considered structurally neutral also called the neutral axis so checking in this zone is just separating the opposing forces as the neutral axis offers little to no structural support itself
watch them through the seasons the open and close it is interesting how the material works
im assuming none of the checks go through the beam how wide and or deep are they i know most people would say its standard checking and not to worry but shit like this always feels scary are any doors or windows sticking that didnt used to be any cracks or pops seen near where the beam terminates if all that is good its probably fine just stay aware and keep and eye out
not a lot goes on down the centerlinedepthwise of a beam top is in compression bottom in tension it flips in the center so technically theres a point where the fibres are neither in compression or tension
this is a normal process called checking nothing to fret about structurally and is considered by many to enhance aesthetics
nah
nope
no
no
thats not cracking woods just breathing
its insane to me how many people actually think this is a problem on here look at any timber framed house almost all of the beams look like this unless they are kiln dried and that is rare its how timbers dry
i actually chuckled at this post everyone has the same question the first time they see it
when it comes to lumber grading the beams thicknessdimension is selected to account for this type of normal checking to occur
all good coach
nope normal shrinking unless its something like of the total depth of the element or matching crack on the opposite side
not yet as long as the cracks are close to mid height which is the neutral fiber in a flexing beam they are inoffensive keep an eye on cracks close to the lower few inches that part is under tension
no its drying
you should be as worried about this as the crack in your butt
i have one that looks a lot like that in my house except mine is also twisting i have been here over years and havent noticed any change the house has been here over years
no
caulk iteasy peasy
fill it with wood putty never happened
fine but just for safety i would mix some epoxy and fill up the cracks this way the whole beam will maintain its elasticity and withstand the repetitive stress from people walking and jumping above
yes youre probably going to die tonight trust me im expert on the internet
the wood is fine structurally but if that beam supports a floor above it it should be covered with at least one half inch of gypsum board for fire protection in a garage
holy shit that does not look good
well im not worried
no theyre fine
no
youre good
no worry looks more decorative than structural to me even if not normal
have it checked by a professional pictures dont tell the whole story the beam across my carport looked the same noticed the door to the house wasnt latching well then the ceiling of the carport cracked and fell the roof had begun to sag due to that beam
no reason to be worried those have been the probably longer than you have been alive
do the cracks checking matter if its a column
yes
timber checking youre alright sorry if its already been posted
what about in windchill degree
if nobody said it if your still worried about it after the hearing its normal you could put plywood over it and nail the heck out of it what your watching for is sag in the middle or if walls start cracking upstairs then it would be sandwich between supported by s
its going down im yellin timberrrrrrrrrrrrr
those cracks appear to be superficial and normal per most of the earlier replies looks like a singlecar stall so that beam is spanning tops no evidence of sag in the adjacent ceiling if youre worried about that pull a chalk line or string tight across one face of the beam from the opposite lower corners ill bet you find none
inlay some bow ties then pour blue epoxy in the cracks to make it a river beam classic‚Ä¶
you could always put steel plates on both sides and bolt thru it
how does a horizontal beam provide a vertical support
mark the crack place a circle around it with a marker or something in area around a few of them on either side to see if they increase i have an old house with lots of cracks just like these i did have one bad winter with a bit off snowload and there was some interior change and thats when i used this tip
gives it character
no
no
nope
why would they put a panel so close to the garage door
yes youre all going to die
no
question since there already a post about it and im taking advantage of top comment my sister have these type of support beam with crack and she want to install an hammock chair on it would it be safe
looks good if you cant let it go you can put steel plate on each side and thru bolt it
correct
does that include no charge for overdrafts
wheres my free toaster
checking thatd be a shake in england
thank you for the explanation
what if its in column form no worries as its all compression
id only be worried if it cracks were vertical
your just listing other standard settling issues even if all these things were happening its not a direct indication of structural collapse the key to all these issues is of course excessive movement or gaps that get much worse much more quickly but normal door sticking drywall cracking or nail pops shouldnt be made to scare homeowners
you are shocked to see people online offering an opinion without any education training or experience to back it up
you mean you chuckled at this beam the post looks fine
the beans in year old buildings look like this dont mess with it
i dont see what filling the crack with epoxy does for safety at all theres no flex from people walking on something this large this beam is in very good condition look at the ends for signs of decay and monitor water infiltration the beam willgoon for hundreds of years
what
‚Äù nominal or greater lumber gives you a one hour fire rating
i think your meaning for fumeproofing im not aware of a residential code for full fire separation though apart from esthetics it wouldnt hurt
not much more then a tension or load bearing element
it depends on the weight of the person using the hammock chair do you have any pics of your sister full body is preferred dm me and i can give you my opinion im a wood expert
yes imo
here at wells fargo we aim to fuck you any way we can so no
youll have to visit one of the branch offices for that
hahaha
no but the second bag costs much more
as a canadian this is weird we spell it chequing account
with an attitude like that its going to be in your bathtub
toaster bonanza
i have same question somebody help us reddit comments are my only source of facts
exactly
cant upvote this hard enough
gotcha thanks
wasnt sure if they direction of the cracks running parallel to the load matters much on a different note i cut into an old growth x the other daydoug fir thing had like growths rings the checks on the outside that i thought made the board garbage only ran like inch deep on newer lumber they would have proabably ran all the way through compromising the board that old wood is solid looks can be deceiving
akastors sister is a wood expert as well by hammock chair she definitely means sex swing
can she fit in a rowboat
why do you need a full body pic if they told you her weight wouldnt that be enough information
aaaaaaand its gone
if you had a column ‚Äúvertical‚Äù like this there would be a big worry if the whole member is in compression and its cracking than you have exceed the acceptable load
thats awful this is absolutely not something i was alluding to i just need a picture of the sister to make an estimation regarding the firmness of the wood
‚Ä¶no
no all right no she cant fit in a rowboat
to properly ascertain the individuals center to gravity to discern the weight distribution of the load
all gonepoof
theres a big difference between stress cracking and drying if its normal drying process this is fine is a column or tension element
this it correct you would want to install steel plates on either side of the column and through bolt them at a minimum
a full body picture of your mother as well to see any genetic traits that might make the wood bust sooner than youd think
omg if you made your original comment with complete seriousness it makes it even that much funnier ü§£
alastors sister is actually his step sister she gets stuck in furniture a lot so thats why they are looking to install said ‚Äúhammock chair‚Äù swing
it looks secure what do you mean its loose when you took the handle off did you look inside the handle or just at the door portion of the lock maybe theres a screw in the handle or do you mean where the bolt is the only thing i can think of that would help there is raising the strike plate by attatching a thin piece of wood under it then replacing the sp
the roses on most latch sets are secured to backplates mounted to the door with retaining ring fasteners that screw onto the back plate around the spindle these typically require a special tool that is supplied with the hardware that is then promptly thrown away in place of that you can usually use an adjustable pin wrench
the handle itself is loose so before the handle is pulled to open the door it rattles around yea i looked inside the handle itself and it was just the mechanism springsprocket no tighteningadjustment pin
i think i noticed the retaining ring you mentioned the handle is the original from when i bought the house so i definitely dont have the tool for it
its probabily just normal wear and tear so your options are to keep it or buy a new one
what is installercontractor saying about it get their proposal to the fix obviously dont sign off on anything until it is resolved properly do you know the manufacturer ask them
no you dont want to use ca on that you really need to use epoxy for this a casting resin would be really good to use like polyurethane or alumilite they would be much more suited to fill a knot hole
i can think of a few ways make a plug that matches and glueepoxy it in maybe made of another knot so it just looks like it never fell out use a sharp chisel and router to make a in recess for a biscuit being mindful of grain lines maybe make the biscuit from a piece of counter top drop try and have the glue lines flow with the grain to blend it fill whatever is left behind with epoxy find a reason to cut a hole in like a pop up outlet cord grommet usb port disposal button good luck
ya just take some ca glue mix some black formica in it and fill the hole with it will be like black epoxy
i wonder what looks like when it gets sanded down to does it take oil and patina
the glue can be polished just like you would see on epoxy river tables a hole that small will be unnoticeable stone countertop companies are doing this every day to quartzgranite that is damaged when cuttingtransportinginstalling
what i would do is go to a hardware store and buy a can of expanding foam and construction adhesive use the foam to fill the gaps around the flue stopper round part and once its dried use a knife to trim it flush to the wall note theres probably a void behind the flue stopper so try not to blast all the foam into that void then id apply a healthy amount of construction adhesive to the rectangular cover panel and stick it back on you may have to clean off the old plaster and paint from the cover panel first but shouldnt be too difficult you may also want to caulk along the outside of the cover panel once its attached for a cleaner finished look good luck
thank you so much
no problem usuperhugecock all in all it should be an under fix
get the one for doors and windows it stays somewhat flexible and wont cause your walls to bow out
looks like its lacking in mud under the tape as well as a couple of skim coats i would suggest an ‚Äù drywall blade with a lightweight jointtopping mud you can get premixed where you just need to add a bit of water you want the consistency to be a bit stiffer than yogurt the first coat should be left to dry and then smoothed out with a drywall screen second coat with a medium sandpaper adding a water based orange peel texture will help to minimize any defects it will still be a lot of work
definitely needs one more fill and a feather coat

sometimes smaller jobs are quoted at higher prices to offset labor costs travel time etc we needed a smaller hardwood floor patch done and it was significantly less expensive to have it done in tandem with a larger hardwood floor project in our home if you like the person id ask about the pricing should be able to give you a breakout of labormaterialsetc good luck its a great idea
thats definitely a not interested in the work bid
the cost is the access door
thats slightly on the high end but youll probably get a good install i charge on the higher end myself but i also take extra time and steps to make sure my installs are better than anyone in town thats what i charge for i wouldnt want anybody to touch that on my house for nowadays like another commenter said have you seen his other work
they sell x pvc lattice for like you would only need a few hundred dollars in lattice and then a couple hinges and nails and screws and you are done it is diy for sure
sounds high to me hire a handyman or be nice to one on your block
who quoted you if its a contractor with a license they will likely see structural modification or construction for attachment that others dont see the door and face attachment will likely need the wood outdoor grade primed sealed and painted there could be issues related to code that must be met visualization and wording are easy but the actual work can be a different story ive seen people get jobs done and when there where other issues not foreseen by inexperienced handymen there was lots of afterwards because of damage andor rework to correct the work and damage with our economy today materials tools and experience may not be visualized accurately
waaay to high lattice is cheap and it would literally take an hour or
diy is the answer for something this straightforward and simple
did they give you a breakdown heres a conservative estimate in materials op markup hours guys hr op markup hours job truck hr op markup total assumptions full hr shift for site surveymeasurements material procurement travel time material pickup and mobilize materialequipment to site site work travel back to shop pickup blue book rate op covers all overhead ins bonding officeshop use estimatinginvoicing time etc profit incidentals ie fuel small tools etc labor markup assumes employee receives benefits and employer pays required insurance and taxes
a couple sheets of vinyl lattice a few pt xs and a little bit of hardware maybe in materials dont overthink the access door just make it a removable panel this shouldnt be more than a project if you pay someone to do it
do you have other estimates to compare to if not then it sounds like the estimate is just right blows my mind that there are people shitting on this estimate price without knowing exactly what was quoted what the plan was to get it done etc also just because your neighbor is a contractor doesnt mean that they do everything they might normally do shower remodels and make in a day as opposed to doing this type of punchlist job where he might have in material and plans to make instead everybody wants three things with every single project on their house they want the best material the best install and the cheapest price you can only ever have two of those
don ªt put a door just unscrew the lattice on on end and slide on in
my guess is the cost is building the door as it would probably need another x post you can use one of the existing posts for the hinge side but would need another for the latch side of the door but even then just putting in another post and building a x door is not a lot of work of course if materials are included it would offset those costs some but as others have stated this is not a hard job id do it myself and save k
you got quoted the ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù price they would rather not waste day on such a small project so that is the price that makes it worth it to them
im gonna chime in here and say that it sounds pretty reasonable to me
i disagree with all of you saying its to high its not just lattice heshe wants a access door that means the lattice and access door need to be framed with pressure treated its a door so latches handles and hinges screw etc heres the part that no ones talking about heshe has to get paid they probably have company insurance a license to do business in the area they have a truck and all the costs with that could very well be a person crew they have to travel to the store to get the stuff theres more no doubt i think people are getting confused with paying the kid next door to do it after school im around k on that job also you need to take into account the spike in every life cost now hr is the new hr get quotes and youll have your answer take the one in the middle source i do this work in ontario
seeing most comments that this is too high not sure of everyones expertise but this is work that i do very often so material costs are probably about the thing is with nothing for the bottom border to attach to you need to have something to attach your bottom border to so it has some rigidity so throw in another ish the problem is which i run into often with small jobs is that its hard to find companys willing to take a day man power travel etc for less than so depending how far travel is id probably price this around i dont think that price is outrageous id ask them to come down to even and its a deal theyll do it correctly and save you the headache of learning how to do it on the fly
you can call around some handymans show them the picture and ask for quotes over the phone or online you can even price most of the material needed and order it for delivery your cost would be labor and you can estimate that per hour and add some overhead expenses the person might have to arrive at a healthy estimate
am i not seeing this right it sounds like there may be no current access to under the house and what looks like a brick foundation i dont think the cost quoted is for slapping a door over an existing opening and throwing some lattice on i could be wrong but i didnt see where op clarified sounds reasonable if there is no current access imo
yo need a structure to support the lattice and a structure to support the door are you putting a roof over it for cost of materials and labor that price seems reasonable
i understand that there currently an access door to the crawl space the price does seem a little high based on what i can see it would be helpful if you posted details of the quote what are the materials and work specified before enclosing that space i do suggest completely covering the ground underneath the porch to several inches beyond the expected edge of the lattice redoing the pavers and preventing weedsgrass from coming up through the lattice is easier now than later i would also move the mulch away from the stairs good luck with your project
do it yourself seriously no electrical no plumbing involved‚Ä¶ just some staples nails screws paint and a few cuts with a circular saw its a very easy project
i work for a local contracting company from your description this photo id offer for labor materials if you offered to supply the materials toolsequipment excluded easily
better way is no door just latice and have the lattice on hinges so you can swing it open i cant see this costing more than a couple hundred if you do it yourself or maybe if you pay someone else but i think a lot of contractors just throw out really high prices because there are enough people who will just pay it if you cant or dont want to do it yourself or see if there is someone in your neighborhood who will do it for less
you need to talk with him about what is so costly and what your expectations are what do you envision as access door
i would put a wooden gate on the other side and staplebrad some lattice myself
i want to enclose under our side porch stairs with pvc lattice and have an access door to be able to get to the crawl space underneath was quoted i live in the southeast us fair quote too high why delete the description of this post
diy
just do it yourself mate its easy and cheap cheaper from wood x lattice x sized as need for the sides screw into place gate xlatticex hang gate and latch hardware easy peasy lemon squeezy could even go cheaper just stapling lattice up around sides and to a x door
if you want a finished look ie picture framed that price seems reasonable
here is a suggestion if you dont have construction skills use green treated xs as a footer between the footings then make a template out of cardboard for the side with the angle transfer the template to the lattice attach the side with the angle then at the other side just screw it on if you want to gain access just unscrew that side if you need to get in there frequently then youll need to make a door thats a slightly more difficult problem involving framing the lattice and attaching with hinges you could do this and buy a very nice set of batterypowered hand tools for way less than the price quoted here is an example of what a good combo milwaukee drilldriver and saw would cost used if youre just doing occasional home projects they would last years
cost of lattice framing making a custom height door or buying one and the time to put it all together probably not far off
if the price too high diy
his price is his price some guys will work for a paycheck others actual run a business there is a big difference in some diy crap and a professional done looking job been building homes for yrs his price is fair
good lord your contractor is a thief
deviating from the topic how do you maintain your white risers i have interior stairs similar to yours and have a hard time keeping it clean üòÅ
everyone wants every thing done for free a good carpenter charges around a day materials with a small markup travel time hardware for door a door itself this is a fair price if the job is executed correctly and is long lasting or you ca pay less and it wont last good work aint cheap and cheap work aint good
i think everybodys forgetting about labor and time i think its a fair price its going to take time and hes using all of his own tools to cut everything custom fit plus the hardware is expensive as someone else said the fact that its just two sides doesnt matter it needs to look good as well as be functional
the price is on the high side but not too insane as other commenters are saying most of the cost will be the door which by itself can run a couple hundred dollars framing the opening to access under the stairs and making the door itself this can vary wildly depending on the quality and workmanship another thing is the quality of the pvc lattice and surrounding framing you can do it cheaply with little support or you can add a solid frame and support for the lattice to make it very strong that will increase the cost anyways look at the contractors previous work they should have pictures of prior jobs and also get another quotes to see if its a fair bid
way too high
err definitely too small of a job they are giving you the this is how much id have to be paid to do this this would take an hour to complete and cost maybe you may be able to find a handyman to do this for but the quality wont be a guarantee
wont anyone talk about the married x acting as support for the deck they also dont look pt and are sitting on tiles unattached
i mostly agree with the comments here its high but i dont think crazy high i would have guess a max of k but more than still i dont think i would pay that money for that job
bro that will cost you bucks to do it yourself
it is high but that is what people want to charge your only option is to spend a couple hours and diy it
whoa
we did this attached the lattice to a wooden x frame in between the uprights and made the panel easily removable used trim on panel edges for clean lines cant tell the access door is there
door to door this is a day of work hours at your local rate an hour and in materials so feels about too high unless you asked for something fancy with the access door
i quote professionally and this is seems fair
watch some youtube do it yourself have fun
yes its a fair price for a professional to come out and do that work youre looking at bringing a work trailer out setting up tools getting materials cutting and fitting and finishing the material costs are always going to be lower for a project like this the time and effort for professionals to design schedule and install are the real cost of the project if you are a diyer type you can do if for probably a of the cost shop around a handyman type small outfit might be your best bet workers comp and liability come with a cost
yes is way to much try finding someone to do it for a pack of beer
op tell us more about the access door you want to cut a hole in the brick i dont understand the details also plastic lattice looks cheap in my opinion your house looks super charming consider doing wood lattice personally not a big fan of lattice mostly but can look sharp or wood or cement fiber trim in slats might look sharp as well
did the quote include a concrete pad under the landing if not quote is to high if you do it yourself and dont put a weed barrier‚Ä¶
also the wood posts holding the landing up is in direct contact with concrete the wood in contact with a simple concrete block looks to be wet and rotting wood concrete and water dont last long together
i think it would be hard to get it much less unless you do it yourself
access door put hinges at the top and lift the x when you need access you could
ya seems a little high to me but dont forget your paying for the labor and the knowledge that the person has and even though the job looks small it takes quite a bit to do it right
if youre planning a home renovation project especially for your bathroom and shower system i highly recommend checking out hydroblok their shower panels and systems are not only visually appealing but also incredibly easy to install and waterproof ensuring durability and longlasting use dont hesitate to visit their website at to explore their range of products and start your shower upgrade journey today
bro can you not figure out how to do it yourself seems like an extremely easy thing to do considering its mainly cosmetic and lattice is easy enough to deal with whether it be wood or pvc
with painted white stainless finish screws and pvc lattice solid corner boards with plugged screw holes and a nice boat quality latch on the door its fine start taking away certain elements and it quickly becomes overpriced imo
thats a quote from someone who is busy and doesnt want to waste their time on a small project they figure you wont take it but if you do the high cost will make it worth their time this is a very simple job you should just do it yourself
in supplies hours labor most contractors wouldnt bother because it isnt worth gassing up a truck
i would just do lattice and make the larger side where you can remove the screws to access this would also prevent you from having to lock the door xb you can also use some fastener covers to give it a nice clean look see below scres is not outdoor rated i would use deck screws if possible as they will stand the test of time xb
thats a diy all day thats why the quote is high unless your wrap around is a hundred feet that we dont see
im in the central midwest and i would bid based on the picture does seem high to me but like someone else said if this is pulling away from another higher paying gig i can see bidding high that said if you were my literal neighbor that ive done work for before i wouldnt bid it high and might even do ish lower since i dont have drive time
yes its two sides with an access door almost the height of the porch
came here to say this they also bump the cost of small jobs if they are busy with larger jobs already why bother with a one day project when you have others that will keep you working for a month
shit id never let a homeowner see a proper breakdown of why i need a day
i would have one side of lattice that could be easily removed and crawl inside sometimes‚Ä¶but look finished
seems more of guys day price in material each worker
if that is the case then why wouldnt the contractor just say no politely why waste everyones time i hate that
the ‚Äúaccess door‚Äù should be as simple as hinged lattice on a basic frame
im with this if theres no access door youre looking at cutting into the foundation supporting the new opening and installing a door if the door exist already then yes this is too high to hang some lattice
we have used him before for some other jobs around the house but its been a while have been pleased with his work but since its the only quote we have so far i just wasnt sure if this was normal for this kind of job
ha hes our neighbor‚Ä¶
hes kind of in between a contractor and handyman i guess more of a handyman as i dont believe hes a licensed contractor but hes done some other projects for us on the smaller scale
yep diy it and find out why his price was so high
not sure where you are at but whos working for an hour i guess maybe some handy man that is just looking for some spending money any professional contractor who is running a business is at minimum hr per man
could they pay you
agreed plus if he builds it correctly he has to build framework out of pressure treated x to attach lattice too a good quality treated privacy lattice was around bucks a piece last i checked its a day job by the time he gets materials to completion guys then if he has to do any painting more time the pvc lattice is so flimsy you need more support than you will with the pressure treated lattice
apparently its his neighbour
there is currently access to the crawl space under the porch already but since thats the only access door i dont want to permanently enclose under the porch hence the lattice access door i just want it to look a bit nicer and more finished
the lattice would be attached under the existing porch structure under the stairs and the back side
hah nothing üôÉ we used to have a lawn company mow and blow every other week to keep the leaves and debris off but recently cut back on that but the porch was only built a year ago so it hasnt had much time to get too gross‚Ä¶yet will need to figure out what to do to maintain soon
üò¨üò¨ what does this mean tbh our contractor who built the deck didnt get a permit and just told me to have them tack on the inspection when we have our kitchen inspected which is where this porch leads we still havent finished our kitchen to the point that we can have an inspection so it hasnt happened i was unsure of the xs just sitting on the cement block like that but never said anything‚Ä¶ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
sorry for confusion the access door to the crawl space exists already under the stairs picture just doesnt show it enclosing under the porch would be just cosmetic but we still need to be able to get to the crawl space under the porch
my husband is handy and we did most of our kitchen reno ourselves but we had our third kid four months ago and time is limited so i was feeling out how much it would cost to hire out
broskie diy much cheaper like cheaper x is xb
yea most vinyl doors are to dollars not always including door hardware
this guy contracts
because some homeowners dont care and will happily pay to have the work done the contractor is happy to do the work for which covers his time to meet with the client purchase supplies do the work and cover transportation costs op could do the work himself for in supplies a saturday afternoon and if he doesnt have them already a electric tool kit saw drill etc
sometimes a contractor can help out by convincing a spouse that a project isnt worth it my wife has been convinced that few things would have been pretty cheap until an estimate disabuses her of that notion also you price out work like that because you will only do it at rate that makes sense for you i did the same thing in software services we basically had categories yes no and ‚Äúthrow an absurd number out and see if they still want it‚Äù
theyve already come out for a quote it would be a waste of time to say they wont do it at least with a bid like that theres a chance the contractor will get a job worth his time and the homeowner will get the job done
also have to think about the opportunity cost to do the work is there an opportunity that this leads to more work here probably not but its also cost the lack of opportunity to do other more lucrative work like if i spent the time to do this job id need to price it higher to take that time away from more valuable work now if the customer starts also asking about doing a fence or building out a deck the opportunity that this bit of lattice becomes more valuable
i believe you have misunderstood where the access door is going to be
i would charge material and gas for this job is on the high side but not completely unreasonable
lolmaybe there is more to the job than your post is letting on i always get at least three estimates the few times i do not do the job myself i actually got a range from to for my barn roof
personally i love pine green and certain dark denim blues they both pop with bright green landscaping or potted plants white accents any stonework and most flowers
my instinct was also denim blue shutters could bring some interest too
go with a soft stone undertone of white and add a wrap around deck that matches the interior floors a pergola will look awesome coming off the side too with an additional outdoor table for dining white will look sleek i dont like dark colors for this if you must a very dark slate grey with greenpurple undertones
i actually didnt think of a darker pine green both neighbors on either side have ideal colors a nice denim and a really nice green so i didnt want too piss either of them off but dark green could work thanks
its funny you say that our house is white so that was our first option is have it match the house but its a pretty stark white
im not a fan of start white a soft creamy white with stone undertones would look amazing make sure its not yellow undertones that will look pinkorange in certain lighting tangreen as a base
pre drill the holes smaller than the screw or use self tapping screws
the screw on the ground is a wood screw you need a sheet metal self tapping screw
pl adhesive a xx‚Äù ply tape to hold in place overnight wood screws next day
hit it with your purse or push harder
use a hammer to tap them like a nail to get them started
drill a pilot hole or get self tapping screws designed for metal
self tapping are a blessing from the heavens
it looks like its an old install to me so its probably stripped out vs not going in but just a guess
i think you mean self drilling screws self tappers still technically need pilot holes although with enough pressure and thin enough metal you can often just muscle through it
there should be wood behind the tin
that was unnecessary
lol i wasnt going to say it but came here to make sure someone did not to be mean at all its just a common roast joke around tradesmen when i was an apprentice thats what was yelled at me right before someone threw a x or whatever materials were in arms reach at me lol but yeah you can predrill the holes use self tapper metal screws or just mark the holes and hammer a nail on your marks just enough to get past the flashing good luck to you hope it goes well
theres an easy solution for that stick some toothpicks in the holes
replace
replace its cheaper than a flood
not necessarily corrosion could be the gasket leaking on the top electric heater element and running downturn off the power to the tank at the main breaker and take off the cover and lookyoull have to peal back the insulation to see the element mount to the tank repair could be as simple as draining the tank cleaning the gasket surface and replacing the gasket good luck best to investigate and replace or repair if your tank is older than years and your on well water consider tank replacementif your on municipal water and your tank is older than years consider replacement good luck
ffs call a plumber and no dont wait long
it will leak all over act quickly this happened to me a month ago i live in a third floor condo and the two units below me had water damage i was responsible for the damage thank goodness for insurance although my rates will go up
hesdeadjimgif
its gonna go replace now before it blows
if its older than years i would replace it it looks older the upper element is leaking any plumber can replace it in an hours labor by draining the tank and firing a new element in if it is a little newer i cant see the make but it looks like an older style rheem tank not worth risking it ive seen hundreds of them go if you choose to replace the upper element and keep the tank the element should be about or bucks and the plumber should charge you an hour turn the power off to the tank close the cold feed and open some hot water faucets and then drain the tank out and have it ready for the plumber to change the element so you dont get charged more
time to replace container failure is when most people do it
you might also consider adding an overflowleak pan under the new heater if you have an old gate valve as apposed to a ball valve replace with a new ball valve on the supply line chances are if theres a leak and theres leakage from the access panels the insulation with be soaked so install a new unit also replace both the water supply lines
yeah i also thought the same but i have no idea about them so just wanted to confirm
thank you yeah its around years and on municipal water seems like replacing will be better than repairing
im on a well and my american electric is still humming along for years now ive kept a brand new rheem spare in my garage thats waiting patiently for two years now
thanks i have turned it off electric and water drained all the water called the plumbers and they are charging about is it normal
thanks yeah its about years old it definitely needs to be changed
plus its no fun waking up to no hot water for a shower surprise
fwiw ive had upper heating elements fail and cause leaking similar to your photo it was a replacement part that i installed myself that said in your case due to age of the appliance i think a full replacement would not be a bad idea good luck
mine cost k it sounds like youre getting a good deal
the bait traps poison the rats then a hawk or owl eats the poisoned rat and dies the other rats hold a feast and praise the martyr for freeing them from fear dont use poison it just keeps pest control people employed
snap traps with peanut butter on them is the best way ive found eventually youll get the majority of them unless the place around you is really bad exterminator traps with bait in them never seem to work and if its poison inside its bad for other animals
cats
keep an outdoor cat you wont ever have that problem again
exclusion you need to find a way to keep the rats out of your grill and wherever you store pool supplies if you are leaving the pool supplies out you need to get a sealed shed or something
i just got one of those bucket traps so i can relocate them to a nature preserve for the foxes to eat so far havent caught a single one
we bought rat zappers basically you lure the rat with peanut butter into a container with two metal plates once they make contact with the plates they are electrocuted then you just tip the container into the garbage and reuse the most humane way to go imo
get a bunch of ucatch tunnel rat traps or a knock off of the same design put those things everywhere you suspect rat activity empty them out every day theyre pretty darn pet and kid proof next go looking around and see if you can find their burrows this will look like a hole in the ground get some dry ice and stick it down the hole put some steel wool and soil on top to keep them from getting out be aware that in addition to a primary hole there are likely a couple of escape holes nearby so make sure you seal those too dry ice is just co so as it melts it suffocates the rats in the nest
unknown to us we had a hoarder house two houses down so our rat population was quite high honestly for us the best thing that ever worked were simple gallon buckets of water half filled with water we have roof rats around here and they have high water requirements or something and were always falling in and either drowning or id have to take the pellet gun to them just a gallon home depot bucket with a little peanut butter smeared on the inside far enough down where they have to stretch and fall in but ive also caught some just in normal non baited buckets i put one bucket under the bird feeder under the kitchen window and basically ignored it during a week long freeze had corpses in it the next week for the secret of nimh smartfuckers i wired up a solar panel to some batteries that powers a wyze cam that is inside a battery box with a hole drilled for the lens whenever i have time ill put some peanut butter on a tray in front of the camera whenever i get a motion alert just look through the night vision mode and go out and shoot one with a pellet gun with a laser dot has a noise suppressor on it so the neighbors dont know and i made a backstop even the smart ones get greedy the city wised up to the hoarding situation so things are a lot better now but we literally were outside during the day chilling on the hammock and a hawk swooped down and pulled one off the fence and flew away with it screeching its head off in its talons
get a rat terrier
do you have a lot of vegetation that they tend to like to live in we got rid of ours when we tore out a x ft patch of bamboo we had a whole ecosystem living in there my in laws had to tear down huge palm trees but that took care of the problem for them were both in the gulf south and have pools
look up shawn woods mouse trap mondays on youtube then search for rat traps he has many ideas
outdoor lights did wonders for us i strung up christmas lights that come one and stay on at night keeps them away from the areas that i need them away from and slowly work on the population with something like a live animal trap or snap trap definitely stay away from poison last thing you want is one to wander into a spot you cant get it out of and die definitely second getting an outdoor cat or two as well
baking soda flour water mix make an oatmeal out of it they cant pass gas theyll die
i agree snap traps i use bigger snap traps for ground hogs i tried everything else you can imagine lots of people told me to shoot them but you cant sit out waiting for them all day then when you take a shot if you miss they run away the traps work hours per day theyre very effective but they have a few downfalls such as you have to keep checking the traps deal with the dead rats they may get trapped but not killed catch something other than a rat once you eliminate them fortify the places they are getting into
and a pellet gun
that seems like a cruel way to kill them
storage cubes and containers
but the depth in both degrees is about mm
google the home edit go to images search for some inspo
lazy suzans in the corners edit susan not sun
i posted a picture here but it didnt work
copy paste here please
this you can get lazy susans from amazon for pretty cheap and then stick them in the corners based on what i can see in the pic you could then put a cupcontainer on the lazy susan and store in it the silverware that you have laying flat currently similarly i think i can see some kind of bottles on the top shelf you could also put those onto a lazy susan
stuff like this
probably more normal to the time period it was built than anything it probably would benefit from having vents installed im actually going through this same consideration now at my house in the midwest from
how olds your roof it will be an option when you replace it
without ventilation they may need a new roof sooner than normal excess heat tends to cook the shingles from below shortening the life of the roof
only about years old
right but if its a year old roof its past trying to save wait till you redo the roof and fix then
every roof i have installed the roofers added or adjusted vents as needed it sounds like whoever did your roof did a crap job expect it to fail early
is it safety glass kinda looks it by the way it shattered id use a dustpan and gloves and scoop out the big chunkshandfuls vacuum the rest if you missed anything youll find it next time you step into the shower
gloves and dust pan to start put the glass into a bucket or cardboard box not a trash bag vacuum the rest wear sandals for the first few showers college style
definitely a bucket and something to scoop it up with save the vac for after you get most of the big stuff up youll need to detail that whole bathroom floor and id just toss the rug wear heavy gloves and be careful of kneeling it might be called safety glass but it will still cut you and that stuff makes tiny splinters that can be a real bitch to get out of your fingers
personally id go with a shop vac with a good filter
interestingly sliced bread the softer the better like white bread is good for picking up those teensy tiny nearly invisible shards after youve gotten everything else picked up
thank you everyone
after all the big pickup broom shop vac etc a wet paper towel is good for getting those itsy bitsy slivers also turn off the lights grab a flashlight and illuminate the floor at about a degree angle the glass should reflect the light weird but yes the bathroom is a flip flop zone for a while
wet paper towel with several passes will get most of the fine shards if they exist tempered glass breaks into pebbles not shards though and this is why a good wash with the shower head will also get them down the drain which is a fine outcome for the ones that dont make it into the towel spray from back to front the let the water move the shards toward the drain but only once you have done the bread then wet paper towel thing while wearing gloves then wear shower shoes for a week and you should be fine also take down that other door and maybe get a curtain for awhile the last thing you need is other shattered door so soon they both were probably made at the same time and thus have had the same stressors and may be on their last legs
i have done this before a long time ago i used a dustpan to scoop up all the big stuff and then used wetdry vac to get almost all the rest and then ran the shower and used a squeegee to maneuver everything else to the drain i did not have green cleaning gloves so had to work very carefully wore flip flops for two days and no issues
you start at the top and work your way down
oof shop vac
lol these fucking milenials
let her do it
vacuum imo i assume thats all glass shattered on the floor there
gloves and a dust pan ftfy
shopvac easiest
shop vac
shop vac
shop vac
just dont eat it after
shop vac i hope id you go this route a really powerful one
or before
yeah im gonna start tomorrow the shower door breaking wasnt the worst thing that happened today üò≠
sorry to hear good thing you got the bad luck out of the way only good stuff to come
thanks lol
well obviously remove the cabinet door and make it into a cat house
you can also google blind corner cabinet pull out or blind corner organizers they arent cheap but these are amazing
a lot of people dont know this but you can put your weed in there
good place for things you need to keep but forget about
adopt an orphaned wizard child
if you put both cats on the top shelf you could probabily get a toddler in the bottom seriously though get a corner unit that attatches to the door so that when you open it the unit pulls out
hafele produces the magic corner now ii ive put in or eight over the years including in my home fabulous if it fits careful dimensioning is in their website the product is easily obtainable online and a number of domestic cabinet companies offer it that would be my first choice also kraftmaid and i presume a slew of other manufacturers has a number of blind corner hardware solutions
i would made a corner cabinet with a double tier lazy susan
great suggestions so far we used it for dishes we didnt use often holiday stuff and sometimes for back ups of food items shop at costco buy oil one goes into a cabinet to be used and the other into storage just one example
we have a corner like this you can install what is called a half moon lazy susan itll rotate and extend out making everything easier to access
you could buy some of those domesday meals and stack them back in there just mark your calendar to eat them in before they expire
airbnb private room w kitchen
can you connect the corner cabinets and put on a huge folding door if that exists
motherinlaw suite
i have this same type of cabinet and its my tupper ware spot to use open door and find what you need hopefully before you go to bed that night then slam door swiftly because everything is tossed around an jumbled and the leaning tower of tupperware will fall out if you dont use as punishment for kids when misbehavingthey have to take everything out match lids and organize good luck
id use it as extra storage
remove the cat and the shelf and always win at hideandseek
christmas dishes in back
sliding tray
some kind of sliding appliance
we have the same set up and put a few random things that we dont use very often in there pans dishes for holiday etc air popper roll of paper towels etc since it is near the floor we dont put food in there might depend where you live but we ended up with ants in there if even the smallest crumb fell
i think you have your answer
secret cat room
lose things in it or cat house are my top choices but i think someone mentioned one of those blind corner cabinet pull out sort of things maybe that would be the most practical
you can allow your troublesome orphan of a nephew to sleep in it now that youre stuck with him
its a cabinet you put kitchen stuff in there put blenders and crockpots your most naughty appliances go in the time out corner cabinet
booze
you obviously shove tupperware or pyrex in there until you lose the tops and the will to live duh
hi custom woodworker person here how wide is the door opening at the front between the frame it looks pretty narrow so you will probably not be able to use a magic corner or lemans ii hardware unit in there they require a minimum opening width of i think or ‚Äù for the smallest unit i would have to look at the specs in my book to confirm considering the layout‚Ä¶ even a lazy susan corner isnt exactly ideal in that space stuff is still going to fall off and end up in the corner of banishment but a small unit might at least make it easier to get things typically we would build a different style box with a double hinged door or a degree face with a single door if someone wants a susan corner honestly that single shelf in there is most likely the easiest way to use the space if the door opening is too small to accept pull out hardware
thats where the fondue pot bread maker ice cream maker and dehydrator that you got as wedding gifts go they will be happy there until you move
google kitchen corner
put a lazy susan in it and fill it with tupperware or less frequently used items
hide in it when the cops come
blind kitchen corner cabinet
this cabinet was the best for hide and seek as a kid
install a safe
well a fun little thing i did was build a small beer fridge down there not big but meant the kids couldnt get the beer easily and i didnt have to head down to the basement or shed for a beer just used an existing small fridge ft tall popper er in and its good
i have two of those exact cabinets i hate them i have short arms so i struggle one cupboard holds pots and pans with lids on the shelf the other cupboard has baking pans and mixing bowls
my corner cabinet has a lazy susan in it i use it for tupperware and spices
i call that the mystery cabinet who knows what youll find in there clippers guards air freshener plugins extension cord hair extensions envelopes
that is where all the things you think you need but would actually never go to the trouble to dig it out goes like your food processor air fryer instapot and gargantuan stock pot go
i have the same stupid cabinet i put my half gallon ball jars in there along with some baking and cooking gear that doesnt get used too much but because its such a weird place its not full so everything is easily accessible
mine is double hinged with a lazy susan
i was gonna say it looks like whoever built the cabinets tried to make sure there was access to use the dead space we have some dead space and the cats took it over by wiggling in through a hole at the connected corner but then i scrolled through and saw that your cats have already taken it over its their now
looks like a nice placed to store big packages of paper towels
here is a great solution
you must be friggin reading my mind i was springcleaning yesterday yes some people still do this and i was cursing my blind corner cabinet
heres some solution from tiktok
i just shoved all of the stuff i rarely use in the back of mine and put a cutting boardcookie sheet rack in front of the cabinet door so the stuff i do use is right there for me to use and its easy enough to move when i need to get out the rarely used stuff
i would close it
thats for things you use rarely
i have pull out shelves
if i were you id put stuff in it

airbnb for cats
you could install a pump for a gal water bottle remove the upper shelf and cut a small throughhole for a countertop water dispenser only on amazon
add catnip
fight it
here are some nice solutions
i would put all the bullshit my wife buys but never uses in there we had one of the pullouts mentioned below but it is a pain and actually scrapes the cabinets
until i figured out something better a lot of the kitchen items that rarely get used would end up in there
take the door off so the kitties may have a club house lol
store stuff you will hardly ever use
too late the kitties have already claimed it
i just let my toddler live in mine
put some towels in and give it to the cats ive been doing that all around my house and they love it
i had the same issue if its not against a wall you could put in a small wine fridge on the other side
blind cabinet you can usually buy a blind cabinet shelf system that slides sideways and then out
excellent spot for a false wall and hiding of ‚Ä¶ not contraband
i have the same layout and i got paper towels storage and plastic bags that i use for trash in a basket another basket with mason jars lids
congratulations on your new catbinet
i would just cram rarely used items to the backthe good stuff in the frontim neither a designer or efficient
my initial impression would be to fill it with stuff but to each their own
store a small army of trained rats
install a revashelf kit for a blind corner cabinet
we found stackable can dispensers that fit through the opening and swung them around so they were deep and using the unreachable space either the ones built for soda cans or regular sizes cans of beans tomatoes green beans etc
that the forbidden cabnet for tupperware and when you open it all the lids fall out
real world store bulk packs of paper towel or rubbermaid tubs
i have a cabinet like this in my kitchen i use it to hide the fancy dishes i was handed down from a family member and havent told my fianc√© about lol
put things in it
ive got one similar i added a shelf with small xs and a board across those i use it for small appliances or things i rarely use
my childhood house had that issue my mom turned it into a lazy susan she was very happy with that change
i have this same cabinet so i have a sliding tray in mine that comes out the door and i put my pots and pans air fryer rice cooker under there as well
try a pull out stand mixer apparatus
looks like its already being used for its intended purpose
i have stuff in there that we dont use often like the mandolin that i had to have the electric potato peeler my mom bought me etc
i always use mine to store large kitchen appliances that i dont use often ie dehydrator ice cream machine crockpot etc
it is currently occupied im not sure you want to go through the eviction process
close it
thats obviously cat storage
my mom put swivel shelves and uses it for pots and pans
ugh i had a cabinet like that it was frustrating
it where we store things like vases pots for plants and that one pot you will never use
cabinets can be retro fitted and made more useful this helps getting stuff out of a deep cabinet and this is made for blind corners like yours i believe
space for a small safe then put some kitchen junk in front of it
looks like its a good place to store your cats
first of all with two young kids‚Ä¶this is the hiding spot in the house if youre a cool cat person like others said take off the door and throw some snuggly stuff in for a cat nook in our house we have the special pancake shape cast irongiftrarely used cake pop makeri hate it kids love it used begrudgingly other miscellaneous shit i have for the kitchen my rule so it doesnt get out of hand i have to be able to get it all out for hide and go seek within a minute or two beware it can become a black hole very quickly
the cats obviously like it put some beds in there and put a cat flap in the cabinet door
great mushroom growing area for uh your favorite portabello
thats toddler storage
it turns the house on it is currently off
seriously though its an outdoor weather resistant switch it could control anything
maybe exterior lighting or roof deicing cables
it flips your neighbors lights on and off
the switch did not come with the house it too new
have you gone out at night to see if any lights come on when you flip it any outdoor lights around outlets nearby any lightbulbs you havent replaced that might be dead and not responding to the switch
time to plug in the blenders
maybe something with a swimming pool
perhaps exterior lighting that works off of a photo cell put a tester on it and find out if its even live
cut it out a woman in madagascar
my guess is its on your back stoop area and was a control to an old flood light
does it stay switched or go back to its original position when you let go it looks like a doorbell on some of the older houses ive seen
my parents house had one and it would turn on exterior lights mounted on the garage
turns on the unseen addition of more bedrooms and bathrooms
probably not a garbage disposal
can confirm i have two on the home i just purchased they each control outdoor lighting
ive stepped on them a few times where carpet transitions to hardwoodtile and occasionally on stairs but its never broken skin if theres a spot you notice it happening just hammer the tips down a bit to fix it
ask my knee knee inch gash didnt feel great when i fell on it needed stitches saw bone location carpet meets entry parkay
zero maybe if you stomp bare foot on top of one you might get poked but i have never felt a tack strip in my life if in a normal situation
in al my years of being able to walk its happened once when i was a kid running up the stairs really fast but otherwise never im assuming youve walked on carpet before
not high ive felt them poking through the carpet in more than house im stepped on them in more than house ive been lbs in the various times and never broke skin
ive stepped on them but only after the carpet was ripped up before never however falling on it still might hurt not really an issue otherwise they wouldnt be used
the hammering down is the solution for your doorway but i think the answer your looking for is that those tracks stupid are only asking the outside walls of the room or adjoining flooring then the carpet is lagged and so the edges are stretched over the tack strips which hold it in place
what do you mean ‚Äúim assuming youve walked on carpet before‚Äù
im not sure if i get what youre saying do you mean the tack strips are pretty much never going to be able to go through a flat surface of carpet
sorry as in have you been poked before or is this a new found fear
it is possible after lots of wear and tear that you may feel small points but as another commentor said u can hammer down the points aside from that you would probably never feel it
ive been poked many times walking through the door way but i meant through carpet except the edge of the carpet and doorway
in your current home inflation is your friend you purchased a home prior to inflation with a low interest rate this is super awesome do not discount these two huge perks however maybe you bought more house taxes than you can afford if that is the case then sell and buy a house under your max budget lastly if you do sell then inflation is your foe you will find it harder to unload your current house and what you end up buying will be considerably smaller farther out than what you sold oh and your interest rate will be significantly higher if you can swing the payments on your current house do it your income will go up over time your house payment will not you are locked in at a low interest rate and pre inflation dollars for the house dont take my word for itgo looking at houses and current interest rates in your area let the data lead you to a decision best of luck
taking the political jab out of it not agreeing or disagreeing you bought yrs ago so you should have a ish rate i assume escrow has jumped for most because property value skyrockted and the tax man reevaluated higher and insurance has jumped as well to your issue at hand when you bought the house were you actually able to afford it taking in account some hiccups it seems like you were barely making it to begin with you could sell your place and take in a decent profit but where will you go rent is insane and whatever profit you get from the house sale would probably be drained in rent within a few years and now youll be in a position where you cant find a home in your price range id knuckle down and stick where you are short term it might be pain but long term youll be better off
lol as if the current president is to blame for macroeconomic conditions many years in the making but sure you need someone to blame for your financial mistakes
‚Äúthanks to our great and fearless leader‚Äù‚Äî‚Äî what exactly was your point in making this post political
what does the president have to do with your situation enlighten me
compare the cost of your rent to the cost of your mortgage more than likely youre better off with the mortgage the problem with selling is you give up an asset that will be very hard in todays climate to get back better would be to try to offset your income your wife could take on tutoring kids out of school she has the contacts and contact with parents so theres opportunity there for work at home helping out kids who are falling behind focus on the positive of it and it might help out you dont mention your work but im sure you could get some extra work somewhere better to do that and struggle for a few years to try to clear the escrow debt why when you retire and are renting life is extremely hard if you own your own home and its paid off youre finally free and thats a light at the end of the tunnel worth working toward it sucks you cant be comfortable now but at least you have the option in your future another option is refinance and roll the escrow into the new mortgage another possibility is to talk to a financial advisor to try to find a way out of the escrow if you refinance
given your partisan stance why dont you just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and work harder to make up for the increase in payment when owning a home you should have an emergency fund for unexpected expenses if cant figure our your escrow and how to maintain an emergency fund home ownership may not be for you
i would look very closely at the interest rates the bank issues and the availability of housing currently if you can knock out the ot and get back on top and able to keep the house i suggest doing this
sounds like you should just pull yourself up by your bootstraps it would be incredibly stupid to let go of an asset with interest that is a very very shortsighted move and will impact your life for many years to come
as a lot of other comments have said i would try and stay in that rate mortgage if you can because you wont get that again and buying another home will mean your buying power is significantly diminished an option i havent seen suggested as its potentially more workrisk than you might want to take on is to move out rent a place in your price range and then rent out the home you bought obviously a lot needs to go into that but for me personally i would choose that over selling
so i keep seeing similar posts to this is the property tax and insurance escrow being setup on new builds for only the lot value initially and of course the value jumps when it goes from lot to lothouse so the escrow is instantly negative when taxes are assessed on the house
what would the house rent for could you rent it for a year to cover the costs and then save money by downsizing to a rental while you work on your own financial situation dont just throw away a great interest rate mortgage if its favorable towards helping your situation
in your current home inflation is your friend definitely true the one class of people that benefit most from inflation is fixedinterest debtors
at the time we bought the house we both were actually making less the mortgage was only about a of monthly income so i would say that meets a fair ratio at mo to rent which was and yes we locked our rate at thanks for the advice
not only this but rent is almost as much as mortgage payments now
my poor life choices are never my fault its always someone elses fault thank you
this shows what the group who controls the current president did you cant just print piles and piles and piles and piles and piles of money then be surprised when the law of supply and demand finally catches up more money in the system means it gets de valued meaning you need more money to buy the same thing that was cheaper before bidens controllers gained power again when inflation causes higher prices the demand for credit increases raising interest rates which benefits lenders aka banks the ones hurt the most by bidens controllers policies are democratic constituents it is bizarre that the people most harmed are the people who were the most enthusiastic to usher the democrats back into power bizarre truly bizarre
not specifically on the mortgage issue if you read my text in context with inflation the president has everything to do with inflation
dont worry im sending them thoughts and prayers
excellent answer on all levels
yeah we thought about that too but it would only offset the mortgage what i mean by that is if we offer the house for rent it would be the same price as what our mortgage would be currently which isnt terrible it would still offset the amount that we will owe by someone else paying it but then what about the costs that come with renting your own property would it then be worth it still that was what we took out of it
i sense you are going to keep your dream house and just suck it up in the short term you are not gonna find any more
before or after taxes what else are you spending money on
quantitative quantitative easing qe is a monetary policy action where a central bank purchases predetermined amounts of government bonds or other financial assets in order to stimulate economic activity quantitative easing is a novel form of monetary policy that came into wide application after the financial crisis of it is intended to mitigate an economic recession when inflation is very low or negative making standard monetary policy ineffective quantitative tightening qt does the opposite where for monetary policy reasons a central bank sells off some portion of its holdings of government bonds or other financial assets opt opt out of downvote to remove v
lol its clear you dont understand macro economics from the inflation comments and you dont even know personal finance based on your poor decisions in buying a home all of your problems could have been avoided with more research i literally was and am in the same situation however a little common sense told me that taxes would adjust to reflect the new values of homes in an area this is not exclusive to my area its a fact of life as far as inflation goes no the fed has more to do with that current fed chair appointed by previous administration either work more and have wife get a nd job or sell home and do better for yourself next time hopefully you learn if you just blame others theres no reason to improve yourself
renting when you can barely cover the mortgage would be catastrophically stupid one bad renter and youd be on the hook for thousands in damages that you dont have
president has control of who can and will be the fed chair if the current fed chair is the same as it was in the previous administration why is it that now inflation has skyrocketed because our current administration is all about printing money and giving free handouts so it is only natural in supply and demand for cost of about everything to go up
yeah this is the ‚Äúrisk‚Äù that i mentioned if youre truly paycheck to paycheck this is probably not for you ideally you have some type of emergency fund for the rented home and you can charge above the mortgage payment to cover maintenance costs of the home and add to the emergency fund for when you inevitably get a renter that costs you thousands only way around this risk potentially would be if you had friends you trust that need to rent and would be willing to rent from you that comes with its own messiness though‚Ä¶
can you tell me what policies have been implemented that you are referring too i am not aware of any free handouts aside from the covid relief payments that occurred under the previous administration i love to know and understand other perspectives i mean this earnestly please give me something i can look into to challenge my perspective fwiw i agree with the premise of supply and demand but just disagree with how you believe it is being applied in the current situation so i guess im specifically asking what actions this administration has taken that has increased the money in circulation
its pretty easy to look up that the fed chair powell was indeed appointed by trump verifiable fact sorry i happen to agree that it might have been better to replace him when biden took office but here we are and hate to burst your bubble but this financial mess has been brewing for a very long time even before trump many administrations have had their hands in this mess so you dont get to just blame it on a president you dont like in fact a big part of this situation is not even something the government can really control corporations supply chains and global conditions play a huge factor which is why nothing theyre doing is actually working that being said your situation sounds more like ignorance of how home buying works specifically new construction and tax assessment as far as your escrow shortage thats extremely common with new construction because the taxes are initially based on the land only for that first year a good lender and re agent would have prepared you for the true payment once the home was assessed many title companies will require prepaids for that first year but after that its up to you to know what your payment will be your escrow will always be higher now that its not being assessed on the land only ive owned several new builds and our lendersagents have always made sure we understood that the first years taxes will be an anomaly so should you sell well if you just bought in the past few years youll lose money unless it went up in value enough to erase the closing costs you paid that said if you cant afford the full payment including taxes and insurance you may have no choice i guess it depends how far off you are budgetwise and how much you want to keep the house you dont really provide enough detail to say if it makes sense financially
well just go and get some of those free handouts then
get a heloc on the house assuming its value went up over the last years dont draw on it but have the access to cash if you need it to cover a bad renter even if rent is purely covering the cost of the house you can now take tax deductions that you wouldnt have otherwise had which increases your income essentially find a cheaper rent in the range and you just increased your income by in a year and get principal pay down on a mortgage with tax savings
if you pulled up the floor in my bathroom you would find a patched hole where my toilet used to be we moved it during a renovation
test it to be sure but likely just mineral wool
i agree artificial logs and some other fireplace insulation is suspect material
but it doesnt look like asbestos
no but you should test it to be sure
you can never be sure unless you test it
time to clean for sure
time for a new tub that one is probably close to years old code wont allow you to build them with the spout and handles below the rim like that anymore its not safe
speechless
this looks like a painting and you cant convince me otherwise
i wouldnt bathe in it for sure
about as concerned as your faucet is
mr lamprey mouth is screaming
concerned enough to never stay at the bates motel again
thats what makes up the inside of most things in the salad fingers universe get your rusty spoons ready
i dont think its mold or anything rather just the enamel chipping off the old cast iron based on the drain it kind of looks like its been reglazed poorly before you can try to reglaze it after a good cleaning would be much more budget friendly than replacing
i cant unsee the face now
acid cleaner and it will be gone
my concern is have you never cleaned this before
this should be crossed posted in i wouldnt stick my d in that
comet a scour pad and elbow grease get in there
this is likely mangnese in your water it is not considered a pollutant
ah bath tub pepper in its natural state carefully scrape the black from the tub and then collect it use an old salt or pepper shaker to keep it enjoy bon appetit
can you explain why that particular set up is unsafe just curious
now i cant unsee that üò≥
in any water supply condition in which pressure drops either due to a main failure or an elevated point of use such as a high rise structure the spout in that position can siphon grey water from the tubbasin back into the potable water supply resulting in potentially mass casualty events the most famous historical example comes from the chicago worlds fair of in which two high rise hotels full of guests become violently ill with amoebic dysentery over the course of a few days
if the tap is below the top of the tub and if the tap is left on for some reason eg youre filling the bath for a soak and you walk away for a few minutes tho i wonder if thats just the angle of the photo
wow makes you realize why regulation is so important all these seemingly insignificant ways in which we do things are pretty much written in blood or in this case vomit shit ewww
fascia and the whole corner could be rotted out
the structure could be called a cornice but its the soffit and fascia that needs help its independent of the roof so you can deal with it after
the maroon colored board is facia board the overhang that its mounted on is soffit
most roofers would repair that for minor upcharge
sub fascia
can you tell us more about the housebricks you may be observing brick spalling which may be caused by an incorrect mortar generally when a modern very strong mortar is used with old softer bricks or else by moisture issues
the base need cement which three inches high
deleted
chip out the mortar replace with new fill in with new mortar tuck and point
look up spalling looks like youve got moisture problems
the white stuff is efflorescence so theres a water issue take a stiff brush and wipe it off then call me in years when it becomes a problem
this is common im a union bricklayer there is water and moisture behind the brickwork also the door frames could be allowing water to flow when bricks crumble like that there is almost always water issues behind or around the area you dont need concrete work you need to get the brick done properly with a vapor barrier mortar netting and proper weep holes for water control
not much to say‚Ä¶ reclaimed bricks and seeing this in several places
nope
looks like a big job there guess the only right way is replacing them saw a youtube on it doesnt look too difficult good luck with yours
definitely dont think you can do this based off of one youtube video lol this is a job for a professional
i just had a quote done for new gutters this morning and was told downspouts are better
well i hear that i also hear the company installing gutters would also install the downspouts i told dh lets battle i will do one rain chain he can keep the other downspouts who shall reign the victor of the rain management we will see
cleaned the sink with bleach and water but didnt rinse residue down and it sat overnight and has made this rather neat circular stain is there any way to restore the colour of the sink any helpadvice greatly appreciated
please describe granite composite granite colored synthetic polyester resin composite cement composite
pop that corner one off and cut it to match your wall arent square very common in old homes you could hide that price with some window trim
it is not necessary to demo or in any way damage the membrane in order to make the niche shorter it can be filled with mud or shimmed leaving the membrane untouched however far easier imho would be to simply notch the tile in situ with a diamond blade on an angle grinder i would not have planned it this way but if it were handed to me in this condition that probably how id try to get out of it
what is on the walls i love it lime
very pretty i know you will enjoy it
maybe my eyes are wrong but is that a pink toilet and pink wall with the window on it
do you ever have people accidentally shit in the bidet
why install and extra fixture when you can achieve the same results with a bidet seat
nice wish i had a bidet
nice üòç love that wall colour
love it but why not go with a washlet got to be cheaper
gorgeous
beautiful shade of blue and perfect for a bathroom
no way could i even fit in that shower lol
this man got the follow up to the micro cement post good progress
absolutely gorgeous
beautiful work amigo
congratulations but that sink is way too low to wash your hands s
i dont understand why you never see these microcement bathrooms with a floor drain in the us it seems like a no brainer love your new bathroom üòÅ
youve got a drinking fountain next to the toilet nice
thank you all the walls and floor are microcement
thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
hehe nope the other walls are grey and the bidet and toilet are white
wtf hahhaa no we all have bidets around here
here its far way more common to use the traditional bidet so its cheaper and there are more quality options
ive used both a seat and the traditional pony the seat is really useless frankly the pony allows for superior access and far better cleaning results the seat is better than nothing i will give it that
go get one
thank you‚ù§Ô∏è
not around here in our country its really common to use a traditional bidet
thank you
its not as small as it seems hehe
hehe im a girl thank you
thank you‚ù§Ô∏è
thank you
hehehe
those are for washing your feet
hehe here its not tha common either idk why and we chose it because we liked it but also it was the cheaper option on the market
yeah pretty useful to stay hydrated
ah okey dokey they are not as common in the us on our trip to italy i had a friend that couldnt figure out why the hotels urinal had a faucet lol
how does it work‚Ä¶ do you get up from the toilet and then hover over the bidet do you pee in the bidet‚Ä¶ im used to the bum gun and not the separate kit
im not sure how it would ever be cheaper to install an entire additional plumbing fixture but sure how does this work in practice though you poop then you just kinda squat shuffle over to the bidet while hoping theres no dangling poop that might fall spray your ass with the bidet does the bidet flush theres gonna be some poop bits in there and then dry it seems a lot harder then turn on sprayer turn off sprayer dry
brother i have a toto washlet that has anheated seat with functions for stream position pressure temperature multiple ‚Äúwaterwanding‚Äù features as well as a malefemale function that save your presets it wasnt cheap but it doesnt require additional plumbing it only requires a dedicated gfci outlet which we used to power a heated floor i literally cannot stand to go anywhere else but my own home i feel like i enter the dark ages when i dos üòä
genius i dont have space to install one and im not a fan of the bidet seat attachments
thank you‚ù§Ô∏è youre welcome
well thanks for correcting me if you have any pointer on micro cement tips and trick id like to hear them especially cause i like this idea for my bathroom and you are my starting point
i wonder if anyone will try to wash their hands there while sitting on the toilet
you just use the bidet to clean after pooping you could pee there but its not recommended
who has dangling poop haha yeah you just squat to the side and thats all te bidet has a drain its nothing new its design to be clean enough
you can see theres a roll of toilet paper on the toilet tank for big shit no dangling klingons
man i thought bidets were stupid then i got one now using any other toilet is just a horible thing im not truly clean until i get home or i carry mens wipes in those little packets
this is the way
why toto makes some wonderful washlets
uhm why would anyone would try lol you wash your butt there and the water comes from under so it wouldnt be practical either
dont be flushing those wipes cause they aint flushable even if the pack says they are they will clog your pipes clog the sewers clog the treatment plants heres a thread about this on reddit just now in fact
same
personal preference bud my ass my rules i wish i had a stand alone bidet better
i wasnt thinking of people familiar with bidets
¬Ø„ÉÑ¬Ø your loss wishin and hopin or enjoyin a clean butt
well in my country its a pretty standard thing so i wouldnt have to worry about that and if any foreigner comes to my house im more than happy yo explain before they go to the bathroom
i slather on the peanut butter and let the dog lick me clean not a loss at all bro
at the top left of the cast iron lid your type c looking cast iron valve box lid has mud in slot a lifting slot clean it off with flat screwdriver or pickaxe in mud filled semicircular slots has lifting slots on lid perimeter lift it off and look in with a small mirror reflecting sun in if its deep also the shoelaces in the pic have a granny knot causing uneven forward to back loops that untie often the loops should end up even each side not forward and back next week how to hypnotize your chickens to amaze your city kinfolk
looks too big for a sewer line could be a junction box for your lawn irrigation pull the lid off to look
that is identical to the sewer cleanout i have in my yard technically its in the city easement and the city is responsible for that portion of the sewer line you should call your municipalityutility and have them check it out to make sure it doesnt need repaired the other capped spot by right foot in fourth picture is likely your water meter
your sewer line is not at the surface google ‚Äúreplacing a sewer line‚Äù and youll see theyre buried very very deep this might be a clean out but its a weird looking one im going with the comment above me and its a sprinkler system connection have a landscaping company come look at it
thats a heck of a sprinkler system connector was there ever a septic tank on this property maybe before they were connected to the city if so it could be the old septic clean out just re bury it if it is
i would move both the flag and the chimes outside neither really look like they belong and they arent building a cohesive vibe
agreed with others both belong outside
i agree they both want to be free flowing in the wind at least the chime flag could stay i guess
i would look up finishes for boats spar urethane comes to mind but even certain resins would work the tech in these types of finishes have come along way so you may find something just for what you need im not sure why you have a shower encased in wood but the majority of these situations ive seen people did not care about long term or they assumed they could redo everything every time they needed to reminds me of a boat actually youll want to probably put an exhaust if you dont already have one
i didnt know i needed a dumb and beautiful wooden shower until now
feed n wax my bathroom has lots of dumb but beautiful wood and thats what i use
id also keep those bottles off the wood and wipe excess water when done
i have no suggestions i just came here to say post photos of the rest of your craftsman home if you have a wood bathroom i imagine the rest of your home is full of mill work and beautiful wood all over üíï
marine varnish do not use polyurethane
theres triple thick polyurethane and i would look into polyurethane designed for wood decks
total boat that out of the way my advice would be to dismantle and recycle all of it and rebuild the shower with period appropriate water resistant materials that arent going to rot youve got endrot setting in on some critical areas and you probably wont be able to fully address that without some dismantling anyway and whatever is done to clean it up and restore it will tend to be temporary
best i can say is get a good humidity sensing exhaust fan and towel dry after every shower
i also have a lot of wood in my bathroom and my shower in particular you want to use products that are rated for decks or boats also make absolutely sure that you caulk everywhere and use a caulk that will be able to move with the wood as it expands and contracts or youre going to get moisture trapped behind there which will lead to rot
fuck thats a nice shower goddammit colour me jealous
we have a wooden ledge above our kitchen sink with the same issue my husband did research bought some type of varnish made for boats the wood is shiny now which i dont love but when water gets on it it does not seep in it just beads up
mccloskey man o war marine spar varnish to refinish make sure you apply multiple coats after you surface prep this is definitely one of those‚Ä¶ oof‚Ä¶ situations as a custom wood worker i would have strongly urged you to rip this out wood and moisture are not friends but also it becomes a headache for cleaning with chemical cleaners and will affect the surface of the finish you apply to protect the wood in the first place and refinishing periodically without adhesion issues is probably going to be a pain in the ass if you dont sand back the previous coats far enough‚Ä¶ which does make a dusty mess though there are ways to deal with that but it just becomes a gift that keeps on giving until eventually it just rots and has to be replaced also‚Ä¶ that old wood smell i personally hate that old musty smell when im trying to get myself clean
did not see this in the comments so i will ask if that countertop resin stuff is paintable it is clear it is durable but can you apply it officially stupid in this department hence the need to ask
yes treat the wood with the best marine grade spar varnish you can afford use alcohol to remove wax soak it up with terry towels use clear marine grade caulk in the joints etc
get a new panasonic vent fan installed vented to the exterior with a spring loaded flapper that and a new coat of finish will extend the life
watco danish oil
maybe an idea to replace it by pu wood beams that wont rot i think that you may be able to safe it for a few years max since the moisture is already there i think with waxing and stuff you will just close the moisture in and the rotting will continue from the inside
oh loardt
teak sealer
just wanted to say i hope you figure it out because that is a beautiful shower from a distance
strip it off and refinish with a spar varathane that will be the most economical epoxy will work too and last longer but one will be more expensive and two it can be trickier to apply properly
not that i know but marine varnish im thinking
imo use epifanes or totalboat lust marine varnish if you are going to remove the existing finish down to the bare wood i would also use cpes it is a clear penetrating epoxy sealer if you go with that then use the totalboat lust jamestown distributors have good technical support run it by them
looks like its time for several coats of man o war
waterlox urethane finish
thank you
aside from removing every last bit of polyurethane which is doing an excellent job of holding in the moisture thats creeping in through areas where the polyurethane is not keeping the moisture out allowing it to dry for a month and resealing it with a marine finish like total boat and maintaining it regularly thats not going to get any better your window sill is already rotting every junction where the shower glass meets the wood is probably already compromised and its only a matter of time before the wood is a spongy stained mess check out florim they make some amazing faux material products that while pricey and fiddly to install are incredibly convincing and truly beautiful these arent home depot penny tiles so make sure your installer knows how to install their products or is good enough to do the reading and follow their requirements to the letter good luck
if you need to caulk any of it sashco makes a woodlike caulk that is fantastic
waterlox marine
waterlox is awesome
try cactus juice wood stabilizer
try cactus juice wood stabilizer
youre going to just have to hose off outside from now on beautiful concept hope the boat varnishes work out
nice drunk elephant jelly cleanser
i am cackling at the title of this post good luck
i do love the inner sense hair line
termite heaven chumpchump
its simple just dont take a shower in it
i have a wood sink i carved still untouched by any damage a year later used totalboat cpes clear penetrating epoxy sealer then west systems epoxy many coats for both poly for final coat i think cant remember went extreme cpes flows easily and penetrates deeper into the wood fibers
epoxy
lots of polyurethane my friend
i dont think you can just throw another layer of finish over whatever is there youd need to know what the finish is thats on there and then choose something compatible or strip it all off and start again id say your best bet is to like wax it weekly make sure no water gets under the wood good luck
thats very easy just shut the water off and solder it so no one turns it back on
that looks awesome sand all that and use something like a spar urethane marine grade finish caulk all seems will have to redo every few years
for the love of god do not use water based poly or any garbage poly sold at a diy home improvement store even worse is the spar urethane sold at diy stores youll be redoing it after every shower epifanes varnish marine grade wood finishes is the only solution here
marine grade finishsealer for wood something used on boats
exhaust fan is all wrong should be overhead up on the ceiling not wall should be exhausted out and up through the roof or side wall and the ducting should be sealed should be offset from the shower not right above it kittycorner should have some kind of waterproof and mold resistant caulking all the way around the cover plate wiring inside should be connected using silicone filled waterproof wire nuts should be a amp unit and on its own circuit typically connected via a timer or switch so it can be turned on and off should be fed by a combo gfciafic breaker for that bathroom size it should be a cfm exhaust fan note cfm would work you would just have to leave the exhaust fan on longer after exiting the lavatory
you can try all of the suggestions below but from what i can see youre already screwed rot has set in on virtually every joint you can see including the exterior fastener holes rip it out and start over there is absolutely no way to keep the joints and underlying endgrain watertight especially with a material that contracts and expands your contractors were right
ive never seen a shower like this before but it really is beautiful
i would do the following let the shower dry out until it is bone dry strip and sand everything down stain the wood to your desired color fill any and all gaps with a clear resin clear coat with some water guard the stuff you can use on decks maybe give it two coats good to go
sand off all that garbage and spar urathane thats exactly what you need im not sure if it will do okay with the hot water but thats the stuff id assume it would be okay since its fine out in the sun
wax
we have a bathroom exhaust fan that i run after every shower boat finish is a good tip will look into that thanks
if it were me id put the exhaust fan in first the boat finish is likely going to smell quite a bit youll likely want to ventilate that room while applying waiting for it to cure
marine cetol might be a good fit here
thats a cool idea i would however caution op to determine the affects that something meant for a boat could have with close and repeated exposure on a person people absorb so much while they bathe
i soar varnished a tack box that lives covered by a roof but outside its been good for years now probably needs a little sand and redo but spar varnish works
heres a source for highquality marine varnish
ha we just renovated it which is part of why it looks so nice i asked to keep the wooden shower frame with the window against the advice of multiple contractors hence it is ‚Äúdumb‚Äù but we love it
ya i actually like it
thanks how often do you reapply does it change the color do you think i need to sand off whats there first and then apply it to unfinished wood
op needs a shower caddy
yeah its a really cool house but its very‚Ä¶ sensitive im always joking with my partner that its made of popsicle sticks and duct tape ill try to post some other photos later
why no polyurethane i used that on wood in my bathroom should i have used something else
just renovated the bathroom and liked the wood look mixed with marble and tile üòÖ
epoxy would peel due to previous finishes
valspar makes a marine grade varnish i use it on anything thats going to get wet
thankfully no termites in our area
can i rip it out without ripping out the tile üòÖ
you have to run the exhaust during the shower
op i have experience using something like poster above mentioned it is sold by sherwin williams they call it an epoxy primer but the specifications also said it can be used for waterproofing boats it is really great stuff and super durable its similar to epoxy resin coatings used for floors for example where you mix part a with part b and then apply it was thinner than typical epoxy though so i could see how it would penetrate really well into wood i definitely recommend going to a sherwin williams store and ask them about it
boat guy here look at a epoxy coat most are varnish compatible so you can do a single layer of resin and than layers of varnish for looks than when the varnish wears off you can simply add a layer or two hold on let me get my picks xb here is what i would pick for a resin this resin will stay thin but go deep and seal the wood it is typically leave a texture but that is why you add the varnish and a good compatible varnish this varnish is a no sand varnish and out can do a ton of layers a day so it is great for in home use xb good luck
make you clean the exhaust at least once a year theyre a leading cause of fires in homes
yeah check out what west marine has with in catalog or in stock
another thing is if you choose the boat finish method is to follow the directions on the can one of the woodworking magazines did an article on finishes for outdoor furniture and the boat finish did stand up the best but it takes coats epifanes the brand i used on my garden gate needed to dilute first coat with mineral spirits sand second coat dilute third coat then coats top coat the garden gate has lasted well outside where the finish is intact there are a few spots need to touch up
yes i agree with an earlier poster buy a high quality spar urethane dont just get big box stuff i use total boat gleam spar urethane for outdoor wood projects sandscuff the surface then test a small area for adhesion as the original finish may not be compatible if it is sand everything and apply multiple thin coats with disposable foam brushes let dry completely and sand lightly between coats but dont take my word for it read the makers application instructions
boat finishes are for any wood that regularly comes into contact with water i have used it on my kitchen table it is a great idea
what the sealer fumes are the best part and a reward for a job well done
i would just mineral oil the crap out of it maybe idk but its fab
seems like far too much work to maintain lol
marine varnishes and urethanes stand up to moisture much better than poly
youll be redoing the valspar every months worst spar ever made surprised its still sold guess theres still a few people out there that havent been burned by it yet
noted
thanks so this may be a dumb question l but do i need to sand everything down before applying these also what about the parts that are already starting to rot can i just try and get rid of them with a dremel and fill the holes with calk or just seal them in with this stuff
polyurethane and urethane are the same thing i use varnish spar varnish on my wood strip canoes because it supposedly has better uv protection it also is easy to add a coat every couple of years i would not use varnish in a shower application
i think the rule of thumb is run it during minutes afterward
i have a on the switch on my fan super easy install
theres also ways to add smart home stuff like a humidity sensor to your bathroom so it can auto turn off once the humidity reaches a certain level if they wanted to go another step further
got any videos on installation i mean from regular flip switch to this timer thanks
i had my contractor install it during a new bathroom construction but found this for you
thanks a lot
that is a thumbscrewturn counterclockwise
its just a wingnut unscrew it by turning counterclockwise
id be adhering whatever flashing or rubber material to the outside so water runs off appropriately id then figure out how to ensure no gaps are on the inside to protect from rodents or bugs
um of hand new doors repair the concrete masonry work reframe the opening with steel and if indeed you figure those are supposed to withstand a hurricane id be looking at some serious doors made of steel or the like those doors dont look like they could survive much of anything
leave it as is in an event youll catch the silhouette of aliens walking past
you could cut some flexible vinyl and fix it where it overlaps the gaps to keep the weather out
id probably pull them off and trim the bottoms even so you put a threshold id add a strip on the outside of one door so it overlaps the other and you can add some rubber for a tight seal
if you just need to keep bugs and water out use pipe insulation and cut it shape so that it wraps the edges of the doors then spray foam on the inside to make it water tight
also consider putting doors on the inside more square space may be cheaper and better in the long run
yeah those doors are the things bad dreams are made of üò≥
that seems like more work than its worth if it were me id sand off all the loose chips and paint it itll hardly be noticeable once its all white otherwise yeah spackle and carefully sand to shape the corner itll be hard to get it perfect
wood filler sand to shape better hit the rest with bitters to discourage the chewing
sand it then slap some paint on the raw areas
lol seriously though id probably just sand it smooth in that area and touch up paint wood filler to try and get it to match but it might chip off afterwards
your bunny wants to dig which is why it did it make it a space it can do it
get yourself a straw use a pair of scissors to cut it up the middle trim it down so it matches the curve apply a heavy bead of caulk gently run the straw over the caulk to shape better to do it in two phases than all at once mcdonalds has big straws xb want a good recipe for rabbit stew
alright thanks
thanks so much i can hire someone to do this right
sanding sounds like the best option thanks
ü§£üòÇ good one ok thanks for the advice
i would consider it handyman work a carpenter will want to replace it
just noticed the granite chipping today while running my hand over it anyone have any tips on how to fix or repair this
this is what happens when your wife hits pots on the counters lol
fill it in with epoxy is a good guide
looks like a great place to use a barbecue grill food staging area and maybe a classy tiki hut bar people love to drink and socialize around those bars a plus is it would be shaded make it out of wood and paint
fire pit and chairs
i believe its to monitor for rain so the irrigation system doesnt turn on
rain sensor shuts off the irrigation system when its raining
its for your irrigation turns the sprinklers off if its raining outside
if you find it unsightly they make sprinkler controllers that are ‚Äúsmart‚Äù now and will schedule the irrigation based on the weather forecast lookup rachio for a common one its easy to swap controllers out like replacing a thermostat
thank you so much thats exactly what it is i appreciate the help
thank you so much for the suggestion i am converting most things in our new home to smart systems i will definitely look into this

it is legit one of the things that pays for itself over time because instead of watering every day or every other day it waters based on what makes sense lowering your water bill significantly like im just outside new england and as you know there are weeks where it rains a little every day or other weeks its in the low s those weeks you can almost never water and be fine other weeks its in the s and you need to water every day the controller handles that plus the phone app is kind of nice for ad hoc watering the hardest point is the initial setup like i have no freakin idea if the soil type is sandy loam or something else so youll be googling a lot and adjusting things slightly for a while
this is called a pent roof awning would also be correct but awnings are usually made of canvas so a pent roof is more specific here is a more classical design its surprising how many wrong answers were here its not a portico a portico is a porch that other person who said ‚Äúcornish strip‚Äù is very confused‚Ä¶ i think theyre trying to say ‚Äúcornice‚Äù‚Ä¶ which its not that either definitely not a soffit which is just the underside of a cornice
pent roof
i call them eyebrow roofs
id call it an awning
ive never heard of pent roof either good to know id of called it the eyebrow eave thing
the eyebrow
i heard it was called brow
ive also seen that called an eyebrow
awning not soffit soffit is the under part venting dotted grid to vent the roof at the hanging ends of the edges of the roof
eyebrow
an awning
mhoustache
ugly its called ugly
id probably lump it as a portico
a thinger
roof a little one
i have something similar but it goes all the way around my house the builders who did my addition called it a skirt idk
its called an awning roof
the actual design of the roof substrate itself is called a standing seam roof the decorative end support pieces are called corbels‚Ä¶thats all i have for you today
a wittle baby roof
waste of money terrible curb appeal garbage
i call it ugly
its called a cornish strip with standing seam metal roof im a home remodeling sales rep
something about to sag
mustache
landing strip ‚Ä¶ i think ‚Ä¶ try it
solar pannels support
id call it a porch uk but pent does sound better
a soffit
its functional btw keeps water away from the bottom of the door
how much do you think a ft one should cost
outlooker
garage umbrella
id call it extraneous
its called unnecessary
thats a garage mustache
awning
eyebrow pergola
best answer ever full of facts humor and great links
never heard of a ‚Äúpent roof‚Äù thanks for this
i agree with all of this other than the cornish strip which is just a very small chicken tender
for all those who cant afford a pent house
the type of roof is a shed roof just means its on a singular plane and drains one direction idk what type of architectural structure it would be but its for sure a shed roof
this answer for the win
rbonappletea
do you have any links that show how this is attached to brick
me too
i call it an eyebrow in my paper work because thats what my employees called it when i started and i didnt want to correct their terminology if i ever encounter a house with an eyebrow dormer i will put in parenthesis awning
eyebrow roofs are typically curved
thats not quite right a soffit may have vents but a soffit is the underside of an overhang
agreed

this wasnt quite it but it helped me find it ‚Äúgarage arbor‚Äù
so thanks for the help
this would be my reason to use something like this water likes to puddle up in front of my garage doors
also the screen for those who convert their garage into a living room in the summer
depends on where you live
thats not a joke
only a pent roof if its part of the pent house otherwise its the peasant roof
cornice hen is the upscale version
not so tender
a pent roof is a type of shed roof but not all shed roofs are pent roofs kind of like squares and rectangles
expansion bolts for masonry applications hilti or red head would be some manufacturers
in the old days of solid brick walls they would have just inserted rafters and joists into masonry joints nowadays its much more complicated ive detailed these several times and the engineer specified to sandwich the studs with the new joists and rafters and thrubolt all three members you dont have to do this at every stud but every ‚Äù i think and then the intermediate rafters can attach to headers between the thrubolted joistsrafters much easier to do on a new wall than an existing one but if you plan to do this id recommend getting an engineer involved and i definitely wouldnt just bolt a ledger to the brick and count on the brick veneer holding it up
an eyebrow is a type of window in my vernacular ive never once seen that used to describe any sort of roof or awning ive been in residential home construction for the past years
i know ive seen that as well i have also seen eyebrow dormers
yes and thank you
it took me too long to realize you werent calling it a ‚Äúgarbage arbor‚Äù
lmao this is what i needed to know
i feel like triangles would have been a better example all triangles are triangles but not all triangles are right triangles or isosceles triangles i dont know why but when i think of a square and i think of a rectangle i think of two separate shapes
sounds very involved i seriously doubt my brick in particular would survive lol
yes you are completely right idk where my crews got to calling these eye brows but they do so i still write on my workorders eyebrows theres some things ive made them start using the correct language on but at some point i had to choose where to expend leadership capital and the terms they use for awnings just doesnt seem worth it at the moment they know what they are talking about and they do the job right thats what matters i
literally every square is a rectangle but only some rectangles are squares
i get it its just not how my brain works
thats the second time the rectanglesquare discussion has popped up for me on reddit in the past minutes
found the human gpu
facebook post set them outside and put a free sign on them
sell em on next door or fb marketplace im currently pricing out interior barn doors and looking at a little over a grand just for the door components someone would love to buy em from you
our community has a ‚Äúbuy nothing‚Äù group someone will takes these off your hands
makes me happy to see someone removing these i hate them with a passion
break them up and add them to your trash little by little or sellgive them away
wow glad i came across this i have one in the basement of the house i just bought hate it super impractical it covers an outlet when open so i have to be careful to unplug anything from that outlet before opening it also it doesnt stay closed so i have to keep something heavy to keep it closed and keep the cats out one figured out the simple hook and eye latch i placed almost immediately never occurred to me it would be worth anything
facebook marketplace i was in the same situation a year ago and got for sets buyer contacted me within minutes of the posting
you want closed cabinets for your dishes for two reasons first to keep them from getting dusty second so your shelved dont look messy those cabinets should have been secured to studs in your walls you can put them back up and just screw through the back into the wall where the studs are
located in florida
you can fix the cabinets so you know theyre done right but in the first picture the ceiling finish looks uneven in texture like there were cabinets there before do you know whats on the other sideof the wall im asking cuz it looks like these cabinets were glued to the wall why would they do that unless there are no studs and perhaps they slapped up some drywall over a previous opening if this house was flipped by a cheapskate you might find other interesting issues or hopefully i am completely wrong
i think id ask ‚Äúhow is the house heated and cooled‚Äù as my first question‚Ä¶
maybe just ask what the heating and ac situation is at the viewing smaller houses in moderate climates do not necessarily need central heat and air it could have radiant floor heat a wood burning stove or baseboard heaters none of these would be considered central heat similar for the cooling it could have thruwall units or minisplit systems in each room no way for the internet to know this but the agent should be able to answer this question
looks like water damaged wood to me cant tell much from the pics when was the home built

definitely fair game for asbestos then i get cracked up by the posts that say my house was built in is this asbestos
yeah exactly there definitely has been water damage as well but im worried about the grey specs looks more like asbestos
asbestos is microscopic you really cannot see the fibers with your naked eye
looks like damage to me
best option salvage a short plank from the inside of a hall or entry closet and patch with that lazy option stain bare wood to match with gunstock oak stain then apply clear poly to protect it will be less noticeable
thanks ill probably go with the stain
you got an issue with wood peckers they normally only peck where tasty bugs are tasty bugs are attached to wet soft wood to burrow in is the siding of your house wet with water damage thats my guess
seconding the other guy woodpeckers mean wood bugs and wood bugs usually mean water find out what youre cohabitating with
i wouldnt staple anything on the shingles and the net getting blown in the wind will damage asphalt shingles over time kinda like a tree branch
neighbor has had years of success with putting a white pearlescent flag where the woodpeckers liked to go to town on their house doesnt fix any bug issues in their siding but keeps the birds away apparently theyre freaked out by the way the material movesreflects the sunsounds
they also peck in the spring to attract a mate
to collect and reroute the water away from the building
the water spalshes up on the wall for a foot or two since it is coming upwards it can lead to significant wall damage this is in addition to foundation issues that the water could cause
our rental home has no gutters we are in southern california so many people choose not to this year we have had an exceptional amount of rain the grading around the house is terrible and flows towards the house guess where it ends up yup in the garage floods every single time it also seeps up the sides of the stucco walls turning the tan stucco a not so pleasing orangebrown get the gutters
replacing your gutters is likely a cheaper option than the damage that will be caused by not replacing them
gutters will help reduce the amount of erosion around your house and make sure anything hitting your roof is diverted away from the house take it from someone who had to replace their gutters after purchase of a s home we still need to repair the grading around the home caused by natural erosion and water damaged from lack of gutters having the gutters replaced and having that water diverted away has already significantly improved the leaks in the basement
is that the only reason if i dont replace the gutters is anything detrimental going to happen
if the water will cause problems like a wet basement or splash on the siding and cause rot it needs to be collected and removed
water falling from feet up and striking the dirt surrounding your home is going to splash back up onto your siding along with lots of mud after about four or five years of that with luck the paint layer protecting the siding will begin to wear through and expose the bare wood in about two to four more years the soaked and filthy siding will begin to check crack warp split twist and cup at that point if not before bulk water will begin to get behind the siding and soak the structural sheathing and framing the insulation and panel sheathing will begin to grow mold immediately the framing will need about four years of that to really lose structure the mud sill and first floor bottom framing plates will go first because they lie flat but the floor joist ends will follow closely in about four more years the floors drop and the bottom of the walls kick out the loss of support causes the roof to sag and open up then the real fun begins shall i go on
ok thanks i guess theres always a reason
pressure washer
do multiple burnouts over it
bucket of soapy water and a hard bristle brush
paint stripper follow the directions on the can and then spray down with a garden house
we had a neighbor spray paint ‚Äúslow down‚Äù on our street for obvious reasons it ticked off the city so they sand blasted it off that worked they still speed on our road though
go over it with light gray paint using a roller
moratic acid you can buy it at lowes or home depot
ah yes not hitting your utilities is definitely ugly
this is the answer remove paint all the time with pressure washer rent one from local hardware store
beat me to the comment renting a pressure washer is like renting a newer sports car is around rent it for a day and have some fun roast the tires a couple times over the paint edit get the optional insurance
this way sure is
fuck that go for a test drive in a two seat car its free note i said seat car and bring a friend so there is no room for the sales person hit a puddle on the way back to cool the tires but drive slow so that you are not returning to the lot in the middle of summer with no rain for weeks with a dripping wet undercarriage they might ask questions then

i have called a few im curious what other people have paid because im trying to get as big of a ballpark range as is reasonable
have you checked your mattress seams for bedbugs their poop looks rusty because of the blood content also a lot of people dont react to the bites
rbedbugs
i have the same problem i cant figure it out scared as hell to research it i hate this house its one thing after another hopefully someone can let you know then all know to
moldy boogers
ill check that out thank you
i did and there was nothing that pointed to bed bugs
right i just bought this mattress in january so for this to happen now is just so strange there is a rug under on the floor to help with insulation but nothing has appeared to me besides spidersnot sure if bedbugs or other things like mites due to the age of the home
the problem isnt your siding its the wall figure out why you have that jog there and address that and youll have a nice straight line know that this will not be even remotely cheap and just rolling with a jog in your siding might be the way to go if theres no water getting in
this is above your pay grade
my guess is the foundation was poured with a brick ledge and when they sided it they wanted to extend past it for some reason i cant imagine they built the house new like that unless it was done by an ameture
this looks like aluminum replacement siding that was likely put over some type of existing original finish it looks weird because that is the shape of something that would cover the existing finish which might have has more detail or different materials covering it be prepared to take this down to the studs and possibly even repair some of them too whoever put this up might have done it this way because the original siding was asbestos and they only covered it do some investigating by removing layers in a small area and see what you have this is probably just an aesthetic concern not structural but you will never know unless you can figure out what is in there
whos pay grade should i contact to fix this then
i honestly wouldnt worry about it
wish i could but unfortunately a lot of the siding is falling off and i gotta replace all windows and doors
damn a consult from a structural engineer is probably step one then
fixing this can be as easy as dialing a phone wont be cheap though
add extra posts either side then do the whole fence
i havent used nor do i recommend using wood posts at all some may last a while but when they dont its frustrating as you are figuring out metal posts are the best way to go postmaster makes a great product but i have friends that use repurposed irrigation pipe or even the sections of well drilling shafts
fix and easily wont be in the same sentence for this one you can easily prop it up or you can fix it properly by replacing the rotten posts
its not easy but ive done this a bunch dig out the other side so the pole pushes upright hammer in x stakes brace with more x pour concrete pull braces the next day works fine with a sharp shooter shovel
you can buy fence post support metal from home depot approx and make it straight
lets start with do the posts have wood rot at their base it happens at ground level try to stick a screw driver in them at the base in different spots if it goes in you need new posts if the are solid then you dig on the side that movement will that straighten them then put concrete while they are straight and temporarily secured in place i did this to several different times after hurricanes i finally went with xs they dont move much
the x probably have dry rotted and the wind snapped them off at the ground you well have to remove the panels and dig around where the post used to be
heres what i did pry the x stringers off the loose post and the ones on either side this will detach the whole section of pickets at once i removed pickets from the section so i could grab the xs to gently lower the sections once the sections were down the old post had to come out it was in cement so when i bought the new x at home depot i also grabbed a big metal spike about ‚Äù diameter and a drill bit the same size near the base of the current post drill one hole drill another through the end of the new post line the holes up and hammer the spike through both holes then put a big rock or cinder block or something close to the post as a fulcrum go to the far end and push down itll pull everything out of the ground then youll also have a hole the right size to pour cement into to set the new post hang the sections back up on the new post youll need another set of hands to do the last part
might be some soil shifting which is also not easy or cheap to fix
ive done this works well very helpful to have two people
thanks
thanks yeah rotted this row sits in the back of my property where the water drains i supposed it was a matter of time ill grab a new fence post thank you very much
thank you i hadnt heard of that technique when we removed out last fence we used a hijack to rip them out appreciate it
oh yeah two for sure
put in a steel tube post youll thank yourself down the road
yeah some folks use harbor freight jacks to do the lifting but it likely wont work with the post rotted through
thanks
unfortunately that much water in your basement is going to require a lot of work the lowest cost work is to install sump pumps if you already have them make sure they are working properly and then add more the leaks you show are due to the hydrostatic pressure of the groundwater on the outside of your basement being too high and is able to push its way into the air of your basement you can try something like avantimultigrout to fill the area around the cracks on the outside of your basement by drilling holes in the concrete and using a lot of the tubes but that is kind of a bandaid the reality of the situation is there is too much groundwater around the outside of your basement and that needs addressed you may have had a drainage system of some sorts in place when the home was built like a french drain or piping etc and its no longer functioning i would look into that first the best thing to do is to make sure you have a way to get groundwater away from your home in a timely fashion during a heavy rain and that means piping and slope away from your home that also means excavation so it can get really costly good luck
puddles next to walls could be the walls releasing the water they absorbed
this looks like my basement currently using hydraulic cement to patch leaks and cracks after the snow clears ill be working on better drainage outside
make sure your downspouts exist and are clear check grading to make sure water is being moved away from the house get those cracks filled install a few sumps if still having issues
no is simple but i would add additional nailers to make the repair stronger
literally op just nail it back where it was or hire a handyman to do it
i can probably do that thank you
i like to slowly fill mine with pillows remote controls cell phones t shirts and any important thing that i shouldnt lose but for some reason ended up near my bed
they make products for this purpose google mattress wedge its a foam pillow that will fill the gap amazon has a few
caulk lots of paintable caulk ü§£
maybe im a simpleton but if the headboard is attached to the frame just scoot the mattress to the headboard till it fits
i use a long body pillow and get different pillow cases for it it fills the gap and adds to the decor
i think largish cats should do it
pool noodle with a towel or sheet wrapped around it
i use a rolled up blanket held in place by the force of the mattress but your set up looks like the bed may move too easy
my husband made a long compartment there to store our toys and pew pew
i use a bench cushion and just stuff it between my bed and the wall might be cheaper then a actual product designed for the thing that you want
think youre looking like
if youre my wife one million pillows
easy solution take a trip to costco purchase several eleventeen cases of ramen i prefer chicken flavor personally visit big box store and acquire caulk all the caulk crush ramen recommend a pool noodle youll see mix in all da caulk may want to use your bathtub here for easier clean up force pool noodle into space between mattress apply ramencaulk amalgamation let dry hair dryer can be used to speed drying or large dog with waggins optional apply paint or stain to match season may be mixed in or saved for culinary delights later profit
how about just slide the mattress closer to the headboard
expanding spray foam is pretty inexpensive
i shove the mattress up to the headboard then with the space at the foot of the bed it leaves room for the comforter to hang down
how about your arms to push it closer to the wall
we bought a long piece of foam in the shape of a long triangle on amazon it sits on top of the bed not in the gap itself initially i thought it was a dumb design but it actually works very well
couple of pool noodles plus blanket on top or pillows
i think we have those sheets put the pillows on and you wont even notice the gap
mattress stretcher
a dead hooker might fit
used underwear it will be a year long project
pool noodle
umm slide the mattress up more
i had the same issue just push the mattress flush up against it
try whats called a headboard pillow different sizes and colors on amazon got one and love it itll be a giant wedge
thats the neat part you dont
i use one of those body pillows my gf used it when she was pregnant but now it fills the void in between the mattress and headboard
pool noddle
polyethylene foam its not crumbly and is durable cut it to shape and use glue to affix a fabric to the visible edges its soft and rubbery but its rigid enough to remain in place and not collapse
push the mattress up till it touches the headboard
pool noodle
a pool noodle if you can find one with a nice neutral color
rent it to a midget
id also just caulk and paint that gap costco sells bulk caulking please post updated pictures
you could always try a less stupid headboard
there is a subtle tricky procedure for disguising that gap first step to the foot of the bed next bend at the knee slightly and push forward when the mattress offers resistance voila the gap is gone
the bodies of your enemies
you can get an insert off amazon for this
amazon search ‚Äúmattress headboard filler‚Äù sooo many options
stuffed animals
i used a board cut to the width of the bed put that at the foot of the mattress between mattress and frame no pillows etc cramming down into the small space
a box spring
skittles
clean laundry
sement
sleeping bags
i probably dont understand the full layout but just push the mattress up against the headboard
looks like the mattress is pushed against the headboard posts the issue here seems to be a missing box spring
pool noodle
dirty clothes
do you have a box spring and a mattress your mattress looks too low for that headboard you shouldnt need to put anything there
pool noodle look for the fattest one you can find at a dollar store you can tie it in place
dirty clothes
i usually put my phone and remote down there so i have to shove my arm down in the middle of the night to find them
they literally make a wedge pillowcushion for exactly this type of thing
expanding foam
pool noodle
cheap option pool noodles
pool noodle
put a hard foam wedge between the mattress and footboard for ing the mattress to always be flush with the headboard i do this with mine
butt stuff
body pillows
you could jam yourself in there sideways that would fill the gap
i have a sleigh bed i made that gap be at the foot of the bed i then filled the gap with a pool noodle by keeping it tight it helps keep the sheets tight too i then cover it with the comforter
your pillow
handcuffs ball gag toys
old cum rags
the mattress just scoot it up a little bit
lots of pillows
pillows
piece of wood
make memories sounds like a good idea
they sell the mattress wedge which i loved but our new bed doesnt need it
na‚Ä¶thats a great place to keep your sex toys‚Ä¶
i used a pool noodle works fine and im the only one that knows its there
i thought about that the other day for me too
king size pillows
dont call me crazy but once youve had bedbugs for no apparent reason youll want a moat installed around your bed tldr leave that shit alone
i have the same sheets
that got me thinking‚Ä¶if you push the mattress towards the wall maybe a pool noodle covered in fabric would do the trick for the remaining gap i have the same problem
spray foam
we have the same issue and i use two long pillows
pool noodles
the bones of your fallen enemies
body pillow is what i use right tool for the right job ish investment
pillows new bed new pillows use your old ones to fill that gap
an actual bed frame
when i used to have an a regular bed i would put a body pillow to fill that gap and then my regular pillows on top of it you couldnt see it when the bed was made i now have an adjustable bed so no need for that hack anymore
marshmallows
screw the bed frame to the headboard
push mattress up against headboard
large pool noodle works good
do you have a box spring it looks like if the mattress was higher it would butt up against the headboard
according to my old roommate water bottles and paper plates
pool noodle
pool noodle
pillows
a pool noodle
if youre just trying to relay the subfloor you can do the t method you show but look up on you tube videos on how to cut and replace bad subfloor the biggest thing is making sure you have lateral support under the plywood by that vent before you screw it down i recommend a dry fit and just walk over it a couple of times to see if it dips at the edges at all if it does you can do whats called a shitty way of doing it but take a x cut to about or so lay it flat underneath the existing sub floor long ways so that half the board is visible and screw from the top of the existing subfloor down into the flat x so that its pulled hard against the underside then lay your new subfloor atop the half visible part and screw it just the same as the other half this is a lap joint which is a shitty way of doing it but with enough screws in that lap joint when you walk on the dip the support from the existing subfloor prevents the dip on the new subfloor and no one will ever know it was there dont do this in areas of heavy traffic but for just normal house walking around stuff its fine inch subfloor is a must though anything thinner wont work also use glue after you dryfit to prevent rubbing which leads to squeaking
if the washer has a lint filter check that it is not clogged your manual say
i use liquid detergent front loader i dont think its due to overload or too much detergent i washed jeans hoodies and t shirts and with around ml liquid detergent this has happened before but it had been a few months without an issue and now it seems to come back i have already put the washing machine in an empty cycle do you think the pipe or filter at the bottom can be the issue too
there are too many clothes being washed to get an adequate rinse
i have this same problem and have washed single items with the same result
try a cup of vinegar when u wash along with your soap it makes me think of the white mineral buildup that happens in houseplants sometimes but dont use vinegar on your plants that would be bad
ok this happened to me do you use dryer sheets if you do put the clothes in the dryer first and then throw in one sheet the lining of the dryer was making the dryer sheet unstable causing these white stripey thingssame goes if you use the new washer sheets instead of liquid laundry soap last but not least if using powder laundry detergent dont pour it right on top of the clothes before running the water run the water some then add the powder
do u have a water softener
run a washing machine cleaner through the machine to get rid of any built up gunk
check the drain clean out on the front loader and clean any gunk on the door or rubber door gasket
you think because it was overloaded
did you manage to find what the issue is or can be
yes that is my guess
nope im here for the answer

looking for advice on connection points for my sump pump discharge i am getting water squirting out of the elbow joint near the ground in the first picture i currently have a long hose shown in second pic that runs from back of my house to street in front of house do i need a new elbow joint or this set up not good
probably froze i would replace it with a
that is a broken sharbyte connection the pipes problem experienced a freeze and that broke the fitting buy a new one plus the little tool to remove them and its an easy fix unless there are other pipes that were exposed to the freeze
either buy the tool to remove the sharkbite fitting or just cut the pipe after that just buy some new sharkbite fittings and some pipe to replace the missing section
and thats why i posted lol ill look that up and find it
it was previously connected there with a sharkbite the sharkbite has broken you can go to the store and get a new one probably a half inch shark bite couplingyoull either need a shark bite removal tool to get the old part off the one side or pipe cutter sharkbite is pretty easy to connect for homeowner but can be unreliable the better option would be to solder the two parts together with a bow coupling once those are connected you could probably turn it on on the inside youll have flowing water
i would get a rd quote since theres so much difference between contractors a and b
not knowing anything else id choose a bs excuse for not providing proof of insurance is a huge red flag as is his lowball estimate
i just hired a painter to do my townhouse and got quotes there was a k difference between the lowest and the highest for my first floor and ceiling story foyer stairs upstairs hallway and all trim provided a written quote none of the measured anything and the cheapest guy provided his insurance info along with the quote along with a write up about his company reviews etc i ended up using the cheapest company and was thrilled with the job they did they are now coming back to do the upstairs bedrooms and baths
check out paintmynewhomecom its for exactly this situation and to help ensure you are getting fair pricing
also in regards to finding painting contractors on thumbtack its not always but often lower tier painting companies as for the person saying they can furnish the insurance after a contract is signed it does make sense if this is something you need additional insured listed on if you just wanted them to provide proof for informational purposes than any reputable company should have that stored on their computer for easy access
makes sense they didnt do exact measurements a good estimator can typically just look at the room visualize the team working and put a number to in in whatever pricing method they use an estimator in their first year or two will probably take measurements but once they have seen a few hundred jobs from start to finish it becomes second nature
i totally agree
i have a dumb question here by chance is your wall plaster or masonry that looks like the cheaper polystyrene molding and in some remodels that i have done i have found previous home owners used that molding to hide a wire for a receptacle elsewhere in the room i know‚Ä¶dumb‚Ä¶but take a peek around to see if thats a possibility molding nail could of punctured the wire and you are just melting the molding
firefighter here ive seen this happen and surprising it was with a very small wire that over time got wet and arced with the continuous arcing it would start to burnmelt the baseboard might be with it to open a little inspection hole and ensure theres no hidden damage or issue also make sure theres no water leaking
great scott this does look like melting you may be onto something
im gonna pull off the molding tomorrow but i looked behind it briefly and our house is mostly block and stone but i am definitely going to get a better look tomorrow after work it is very concerning to say the least
not dumb at all infact i feel like this is a highly likely possibility i am going to take off the molding after i get off work i did look behind it briefly and didnt see any wire but i am going to just take it off to be sure
handheld steamer
and
good idea ill try that thank you
the ol vinegar baking soda salt and dishsoap method may work too

a fine bead of caulk should do you nicely

caulk then paint

i have done cabinet scribe for this it will cost if you buy it at homedepot cabinet scribe is the standard way to do this and it looks nice quarter round is much too bulky as is shoe molding caulking works but might look cheap

thanks ill look into that
paint it first
knife hinge
those definitely look like original cabinets very cool
an old one

do you have a water pipe on that wall by chance
looks like mold
is it dust almost looks like mildew or something
does it wipe off is it stained your walls are textured could it just be dust settling on your textured walls capture some of it on paper and inspect it closer get it wet see if it has an odor is the wall feel cold compared to other parts of the wall could it be a leak can get an induction moisture meter to see if drywall is wet on amazon or so and non invasive
clean the top of your cabinets it looks like the dirt falling behind from above
mold what is on other side of wall
a fine bead of caulk should solve all your issues
get out now‚Ä¶ thats how scary movies start black shit leaks everywhere
taking a wild bet your coffee machine is pretty close by
what does it taste like
most likely there is a unit on the other side
its pretty dark to be dust it doesnt have a smell either
unfortunately cant get above the cabinets they meet the ceiling
im asking because i had this happen to us we had cabinets to the ceiling and there was black mold underneath and we didnt know we didnt specifically see anything dropping on the sides like yours is but when i read you had the cabinets to the ceiling it reminded me of my issue we own so it was no problem for us to tear down and see what was up it was a pipe causing mold in your case it sounds like youre renting mention it to the landlord
seeping out where the base meets the tiled wall you can see the damp spot water runs behind the tile along the base may have caulking issue along bottom corner or where glass frame meats wall
thanks so like where the pan meets the wall or possibly on the frame the shower frame came later so the shower installer caulked but our friend caulked the pan to the tile wall my dad was saying it could be screws from the frame and the title could be cracked though i dont know about that might just need to get that area cleaned out then and recaulked
i would scrape all caulk off clean with alcohol and redo all the caulking leave that wall open and clean of the pan edge of any remaining drywall crumbs i had a cheap shower kit that i had to keep some blue shop cloth wedge into the edge to see the slow leak better saved me drywalling twice
the globe part unscrews to reveal a nut at the top but i cannot figure out how to detach it i moved into this unit with the light out and the unit owner also doesnt understand how to change it
hold the top part unscrew the bottom
but first the light has to want to change
if thats an incandescent bulb you might want to find an led replacement that has the equivalent lumens and color range that would probably last longer
‚Äútwist it‚Äù
i have this lamp well a hanging pendant version of it the white and black parts separate
clean it itll fall apart my wife dies that all the time
there is probably a set screw at the base where the fixture meets the wall usually at the top or bottom might be an allen wrench screw
begin by dusting the light fixture
step one throw in garbage step two buy new light
above the cap that bulkier black ring should unscrew and move up the arm
i dont know but please paint the top red

it doesnt unscrew
dang it i came here to post this
bop it
if comment unclear
the globe is a singular piece i cannot unscrew it
oops too late i see it was answered already yep google lens is a life saver it is very helpful in identifying this type of thing

you are a lifesaver i could not for the life of me figure this out and was convinced i was on the verge of breaking it trying to unscrew
its your gully its where plumbers can run a jet or eel for clearing it also should act as an overflow if you have a blockage
im not sure but if theres a wizard around dont throw anything into it
metal
so should i keep it covered its been covered with a rock
octagonal
no it is a trap so no smells maybe put a grill over it
